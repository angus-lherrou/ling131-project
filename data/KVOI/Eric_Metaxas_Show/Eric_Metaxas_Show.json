I think I Do just about every single day I I usually mentioned the alliance defending\nFreedom a and I'm asking folks to uh to help them a help Americans are with religious liberty cases I thought would it be great to get somebody from the alliance defending freedom who's in the middle of these battles tremendous battles often with the U.S Supreme Court\nOn the issue of religious liberty something that we understood as a nation but have ceased to understand so now we have to have the court cases\nAre and if it weren't for the lengths defending freedom I don't know how people like Jack Philips domesticate masterpiece a cake shop and others are would defend themselves they wouldn't be able to defend themselves aligned with an agreement stepping up someone to talk to a\nTo match sharp is the senior counsel and director of the center for legislative advocacy at the alliance defending freedom and he's on the line right now that Trump welcome\nThank you for having me well listen there's so much to talk about but but maybe we can start with um this past got Thomas Case ah I just last week a mentioned that on the air uh for for those who aren't familiar with this please tell us what is going on this is a huge case right now\nYeah absolutely so ... Thomas is a mother in Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy\nThat had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said\nBoys who identify as girls are allowed to use the Gulf facilities and so as a result of this very bad policy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show but we've been talking about what the dangers of\nThese policies and schools allowing students to to use the restrooms of the opposite sex\nWell I don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender fluids I haven't my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the au cursed elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean\n... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah that the school district policy made this possible it was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness of about two years ago\nAnd it said we're going to allow students to make their own determination of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect\nThe desires of the child and the ... in this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this as ... daughter was using the restroom does a young boy that identifies as ginger fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade as cautious daughter and to give a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but what the the bigger problem is the school and a blend assemble\nWho buddies religion who identified him as gender fluid that's just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nTo me is saying [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIn\nThe earth's axis show and we're talking with Matt Sharp who's a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and we're talking about religious liberty\nI'm Matt I have to ask you a you know right now there is so much misunderstanding about religious liberty\nOr in America why do you think it is that what really wasn't an issue twenty or forty years ago you suddenly an issue and alliance defending freedom has to step up\nAnd be defending all kinds of people left and right because there are so many crazy situation suddenly popping up in my in my wrong in thinking that it's more of a recent thing that it wasn't happening some decades ago\nYeah I I agree this is definitely been a growing trend within the past two years\nAnd I think it's a couple of things one I I think there's a loss of\nRespect for the importance that religion plays in the lives of so many people when you hear stories of people saying that jak Philips just bake a cake and things like that and they don't recognize that for jak this is about a biblical view of marriage him and his desire to\nDo his artistic designed with cakes consistent with that and so I think there's just a a lot of people looking religions say oh that's just a or something you do on the side and not realizing that it is core to the lives of so many American\nWell and instead of oh no no I'm so I'll I'll make my point later go ahead\nAnd and then I was just gonna say and I and I also think there's a growing 'em just pure hostility like I view that not only are these beliefs you know something you on the side but they are terrible beliefs to have to begin with and and I view from\nYou know live and let live and we can have different views about a lot of issues including religion to know your view as wrong it's bad it's awful it's bigoted and we must drive it out and punish you for even holding such if\nWell um I think you're you're right in saying these things and this is why I guess I Want to say to my listeners folks if you do not fight\nIf you do not understand that we're going through a tough time you you you better vote you better get your friends to vote and you better if you can you have to organizations like alliance defending freedom because they're pretty much all it stands between us and a country that demonize is people of faith\nAs bigoted now again by you know I always want to be clear this is not about defending Christians or anything like that if you're a Christian you understand that you're supposed to stand up for everybody so religious liberty is for for everybody but we're living in a strange time right now where people seem to think\nBiblical values which are basic and which have been taken for granted in this culture for a long time that suddenly\nAre there on the wrong side of history suddenly if you disagree with whatever the pundits are where the cultural elites are saying is true somehow you're bigoted and and we need to understand I think everyone in America needs to understand\nThe basics here that when we have this thing called religious freedom in America what it means is the government now listen carefully 'cause I don't want anybody to misunderstand what I'm saying here the government can't take sides on issues that\nIs is the government now listen carefully 'cause I don't want to anybody to misunderstand what I'm saying here the government can't take sides on issues that touch on the ultimate questions right religion touches on the ultimate question what is the man what is a woman\nHow they relate what is marriage all of these basic things what is a sexuality what's appropriate sexually all these are big questions and typically the government has stayed out of this but suddenly now\nWe're having the government forcing views on Americans with regard to marriage with regard to a transgender a number of these things you just mentioned it I'm Matt with this past year Thomas Case that\nThat the government is kind of pushing with all of them might in Maine of the state or with all the the tax dollars that we give the state and all the power that you get from those tax dollars they're pushing a view\nThat is actually now limiting the religious liberty of people who have traditional\nValues so that if I say well I don't want my daughter to go into a restroom if there are young men in there who are you know playing these had games that they say I'm a girl or maybe they think they're a girl but we don't know\nThe it's now incumbent on your average American to stand up for religious liberty and they say we we've got we've got to be careful uh we've got to be careful about the kind of going with the flow going with the cultural flow because the cultural flow is now\nReally discriminating against people who were either serious about their Jewish faith serious about their Islamic faith serious about their Christian faith\nThose people are are having their own religious liberties abrogate it and that's why lines defending freedom has to step up and so it it's a strange thing 'cause it's not about defending\nChristians it's about defending a principle of the U.S constitution I just want to be really clear about that\nTo try and unfortunately even with policies like the transgender policies were discussing they're being even\nEnforced on churches so we had cases we had to file in Iowa and Massachusetts where to go local governments were saying churches you must open up your restrooms to the opposite sex because you are open to the public and so now we've got even efforts to go in churches and micromanage\nHow they use their restrooms and locker and how they're changing facilities\nAnd all the churches wanting to do is operate consistent with a biblical view of male and female and yet the government is enforcing these policies are trying to even in congregations in churches\nI mean it really is madness but I'll tell you\nIf people don't fight this then it's on them and so I Want to say it all the people listening to me right now if this stuff rubs me the wrong way if you understand that there are problems the world's going crazy\nOr ... you need to do something first of all to any extent that you can be involved in government in school government or whatever it is get involved\nAt least vote folks at least\nVote because right now in America we're seeing a takeover of radical I'm a ... of people with radical views this is not that the Democratic party of Nineteen eighty this is ... ... people with really really radical views out of the mainstream\nAre are being so pushy that they're pushing any moderates in the Democratic party out I mean try to say that oh I'm I'm pro life and I'm a Democrat that was easy to do Twenty years ago plenty friends of mine identified as Democrats and they were strongly pro life\nTry it now see see what happens\nUm we're living in a time where we have to speak up and and I want to say to people getting we're doing a fund raise for alliance defending freedom or if you\nWant to or Ken I'm asking you if you don't want to give to this gift to something else but please folks up put your money where your mouth is if we don't step up right now and defend against this stuff it's it's just awful and it's ridiculous and is destroying America so you can go to our website ma taxes talk dot

I Know that there are people out there thinking oh Eric this fear mongering or\nI don't know what to say uh you know because the last thing I Would ever want to do is uh is you know play to people's emotions in that way but I think that this is it's such a serious issue and\nWe we often just things like well everything will be fine but everything won't be fine and everything is not find if it weren't for you\nAnd the folks alliance defending freedom doing the hard work of of taking these cases on for free and defending them these people would be hung out to dry Pasha Thomas you've just described I mean nobody is standing up for her and the whole school system is telling her and you can go jumping a lake Pasha Thomas like we we don't we don't really care what happened to you I mean that's effectively where we are\nYeah and it is tragic because there are victims of these dangerous government policies you've been talking about and now we've\nSeen this happen to a young five year old girls a result of this this was avoidable had the school district recognize the dangers of this policy had there been people in the school board's saying wait a second should we be adopting this policy\nUm but it's taken courageous ... people like Pasha and her daughter to take a stand and say we're not going to be silent on this we're going to take a stand for our rights because it impacts not just ... and her daughter not just even the kids in the cater but across the country as more and more school districts are adopting these dangerous policies\nWell I also just want to say how I'm

much worse than what's been described here I mean here you have a five year old and a five or six year old\nBut a little boys can be strong but the point is once you talk about this general principle\nAnd you think about teenage kids and it's just it's just a nightmare waiting to happen unless we have unless reason prevails and unless a cool minds prevail in courts of law and we have

that I I Want to mention is so folks understand because typically we don't mention this what what ... was asked to do was disgusting it was pornographic is like a really sweet word to describe what this says this was absolutely foul\nSexual on a level that I wouldn't even dare try to explain it on the air because it was disgusting and it involved Satan right just in case and was wondering where these people coming from right\nSo this is what we're dealing with right now and so this man has to go to court otherwise he's going to be forced to bake this I mean it's just\nIf every American is not outrage I Want to say to you where do you are legion says why we're we're in an existential battle for the soul of this country if you cannot stand with a man like this now what have we become\nAs a nation what have we become as a nation we once believed in in civil rights for African Americans that was a noble battle and and the African Americans when you think of Dr King the way he fought that battle he would never dream of anything vial\nLike this uh Rosa Parks was a woman a tremendous Christian dignity Jackie Robinson was a man of tremendous Christian dignity it's why\nWe went along with what they said they they shown a a mirror a light on us and we looked at ourselves in in in in a new light and we said you know what\nThey're they're right we need to change the way we think is a country we need to change our laws\nBut we're talking about right now is as far from that as you can imagine it is absolute found this absurdity it's playing games with people obviously a jak Philips has not really meant to make this could these people are looking for trouble the alliance defending freedom has to step in and defend this and I just want to say to folks\nYou need to understand this is an existential battle for the soul of this country we need to vote\nWe need to take action this is it's not okay that people are having to defend themselves against this kind of violence this this\nShould have been thrown out I mean nobody should have to take this seriously but right now jak Philips and others have to take this seriously and the ice depending freedom has to defend them I'm Matt this is a really crazy cases it not\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the civil rights commission that had just lost at the Supreme Court used jacks\nCase against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case to find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs\nThis isn't about letting him continue to operate as business and serve every body but give him the freedom to decline certain cakes this is saying\nWe hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that uh your average American really would would rather ignore this kind of stuff and I'm telling you folks are one we're fighting the civil war when we were finding the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight\nA and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody it's just not us against them God Forbid uh the people in the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans it's it's just not right and but we have to stand up to the least we can do I as I said his vote a please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't uh\nDon't are so many people have such excuses please if you don't vote don't ever complain again

not thinking anything of it and I told them out of the story and she was like shocked they were Rob in the house I didn't know well that's how my working life started\nMy mom and dad were hurt who to properly upper middle class\nSo work was always part one of the kids the dead [noise]\nMy parents eventually when more than I was in high school which was pretty hard\nThere's a lot of sacrifice in marriage and I think when we are so involved in ourselves and the second part of part\nAnd I just think that that kinda happened um\nI don't think the divorce itself was crushing as just to see them slowly and it really wasn't any glue they're really hold\nOr is it self wasn't as crushing as just to see them slowly grew apart and it really wasn't any clue\nThere really hold it together if I had my mom and dad here a lot of a bowl and they still get along fine which is very Dana kids but to see something that you invest in for so much just to be taken apart I just don't think they had any rules of engagement good marriage you know they have that\nAnd so John and I would go downstairs and we would move the upright freezer that's the thing that nobody can move we've already moved like five of them that week and then they would just go like\nWe're so sorry that we question it's like no that's fine but use them in a good tip\nThe funny part was we never got called out because we had no extra guys we had no office so it was like you know or walking a wire without a safety net there but John and I were both pleaser\nAnd this industry was very easy to please people would just do back flips if we if we even showed up or they would just be like oh my gosh against it such a great job just finishing up just like God and so we came here to do so and John and I left\nFor college bridges and job never thought of too many new truck as a career for themselves\nOut no never I mean it was like John I this was barren but money in that order and uh we're drinking green bottle of beer as opposed to it or other guys drink and like the cheap beer John and drink and really good deal that was like\nThe next move up you know phone\nKept ringing off the hook for to mental truck at

payments\nShe bought like a twenty foot truck and John and I would work at school\nBut it really became because it didn't make any money for kids for their money it was fine with my mom London and my mom quit her job at the state of Michigan She had enough I mean\nShe has passed up for a promotion because she was a woman she wouldn't talk to her boss and he pointed out the guy when he is a family to feed like my mom did my mom was divorced\nAnd so she had enough of that world\nShe took all her qualified retirement money attached it all in people were screaming at her own mother and my grandma was just going what are you doing\nThere's a lot of people just said you couldn't do it this is a man's\nWorld the first two years when she quit her job\nShip Paris off anything and just lived off\nQualified money and rama noodles for two years and if she was sitting here in this room to tell you is the happiest days for a life that she's\nCrazy but she loves building the business she finally made a profit [noise] third year I think\nShe made a thousand dollars and she wasn't sure how to do their taxes because she was like never had a profit\nSo it was the sweetest thing she\nWrote an checks for a hundred dollars a game to non profits in Lansing\nAnd that got back to the chamber of commerce and some other business people and anyone who is this\nIt was at that time the Lansing like wrapped his arms around him in a truck and what this is our [noise] which was the coolest thing [noise] and Michigan State university had a\nBunch of small businesses come in to talk of the

toilet seat down sit on that and put the clothes hamper there as a desk at night well Trump should study in high school because she wanted to go to college\nI was a kid that by the time I went to school with my parents would be perceived as upper middle class a lot of the things that she worked hard on I took for granted I went that's really cool that she [noise]\nAnd then I ended up getting Fran pregnant and I don't mind sharing this I asked her if I could share this she said as long as that helps people yeah I don't like you're running around but yeah I guess\nWhen when we were younger

sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean ... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah that the school district policy made this possible it was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness of about two years ago and it said we're going to allow students to make their own determinations of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect\nThe desires of the child in the ... in this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this ... as ... daughter was using the restroom does a young boy that identifies as gender fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade as cautious daughter and so to give a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but with the the bigger problem is the school enabling dissemble\nWho but as we leave at ... who identified him as gender fluid that's just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nTo me is saying\n\n\nIn\nThe earth's axis show and we're talking with massive sharp who's a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and we're talking about religious liberty\nUm met I have to ask you a you know right now there is so much misunderstanding about religious liberty\nOr in a miracle why do you think it is\nThat what really wasn't an issue twenty or forty years ago he suddenly an issue and alliance defending freedom has to step up and be defending all kinds of people left and right because there are so many crazy situation suddenly popping up in my in my wrong in thinking that it's more of a recent thing that it wasn't happening some decades ago\nYeah I I agree this is definitely been a growing trend within the past two years\nAnd I think it's a couple of things one I think there's a loss of\nRespect for the importance that religion plays in the lives of so many people when you hear stories of people saying that jak Philips just bake a cake and things like that and they don't recognize that for jak this is about a biblical view of marriage and and his desire to\nDo his artistic designed with cakes consistent with that and so I think there's just a a lot of people looking religions say oh that's just a or something you do on the side and not realizing that it is core to the lives of so many American Well\nI guess the other ... no no I'm so I'll I'll make my point later go ahead\nAnd and then I was just gonna say and I and I also think there's a growing 'em just pure hostility like I view that not only are these beliefs you know something you on the side but they are terrible beliefs to have to begin with and and I view from\nYou know live and let live and we can have different views about a lot of issues including religion to know your view as wrong it's bad it's awful it's bigoted and we must drive it out and punish you for even hold him such if\nWell um I think you're you're right in saying these things and this is why I guess I Want to say to my listeners folks if you do not fight if you do not understand that we're going through a tough time you you you better vote\nYou better get your friends to vote and you'd better if you can you have to organizations like alliance defending freedom because they're pretty much all it stands between us and a country that demonized as people of faith\nHas bigoted now again by you know I always want to be clear this is not about defending Christians or anything like that if you're a Christian you understand that you're supposed to stand up for everybody so religious liberty is for for everybody but we're living in a strange time right now where people seem\nTo think that biblical values which are basic and which have been taken for granted in this culture for a long time that suddenly\nA there on the wrong side of history suddenly if you disagree with whatever the pundits are where the cultural elites are saying is true somehow you're bigoted and and we need to understand I think everyone in America needs to understand\nThe basics here that when we have this thing called religious freedom in America what it means is the government now listening carefully 'cause I don't want anybody to misunderstand what I'm saying here the government can't take sides on issues that touched on the ultimate questions right religion\nIdes on issues that touch on the ultimate questions right religion touches on the ultimate question what is a man what is a woman\nHow they relate what is marriage all of these basic things what is a sexuality what's appropriate sexually all these are big questions and typically the government has stayed out of this but suddenly now we're having the government forcing views on Americans with regard to marriage\nWith regard to a transgender a number of these things you just mentioned it I'm Matt with this passion Thomas Case that\nThat the government is kind of pushing with all the might in Maine of the state uh with all the the tax dollars that we give the state and all the power that you get from those tax dollars they're pushing a view\nThat is actually now limiting the religious liberty of people who have traditional\nValues so that if I say well I don't want my daughter to go into a restroom if there are young men in there who are playing these head games that they say I'm a girl or maybe they think they're a girl but we don't know\nIt's now incumbent on your average American to stand up for religious liberty and they say we we've got we've got to be careful uh we've got to be careful about what kind of going with the flow going with the cultural flow because the cultural flow is now\nReally discriminating against people are who are either serious about their Jewish faith serious about their Islamic faith serious about their Christian faith\nThose people are are having their own religious liberties abrogate it and that's why lines defending freedom has to step up and so it it's a strange thing 'cause it's not about defending Christians it's about defending a principle of the U.S constitution I just want to be really clear about that\nTo try and unfortunately even with policies like the transgender policies were discussing they're being even enforced on churches so we had cases we had to file in Iowa and Massachusetts where to\nGo local governments were saying churches you must open up your restrooms to the opposite sex because you are open to the public and so now we've got even efforts to go in churches and micromanage\nHow they use their restrooms and locker and other changing facilities and all the churches wanting to do is operate consistent with a biblical view of male and female and yet the government is enforcing these policies are trying to even in in congregations in churches\nI mean it really is madness but I'll tell you\nIf people don't fight this then it's on them and so I Want to say it all the people listening to me right now if this stuff rubs me the wrong way if you understand that there are problems the world's going crazy\nOr ... you need to do something first of all to any extent that you can be involved in government in school government whatever it is get involved at\nLeast vote folks at least vote because right now in America\nWe're seeing a takeover of of radical I'm a ... of people with radical views this is not the the Democratic Party of Nineteen eighty this is ... ... people with really really radical views out of the mainstream\nAre are being so pushy that they're pushing any moderates in the Democratic party out I mean try to say that oh I'm I'm pro life and I'm a Democrat that was easy to do Twenty years ago plenty friends of mine identified as Democrats and they were strongly pro life\nTry it now see see what happens\nUm we're living in a time where we have to speak up and and I want to say to people getting we're doing a fundraiser for alliance defending freedom or if you want to or Ken I'm asking you if you don't want to give to this gift to something else but please folks\nUp put your money where your mouth is if we don't step up right now and defend against this stuff it's it's just

emotions in that way but I think that this is it's such a serious issue and\nWe we often just think like well everything will be fine but everything won't be fine and everything is not find if it weren't for you\nAnd the folks alliance defending freedom doing the hard work of of taking these cases on for free and defending them these people would be hung out to dry Pasha Thomas you've just described I mean nobody is standing up for her and the whole school system is telling her and you can go jumping a lake Pasha Thomas like we we don't we don't really care what happened to you I mean that's effectively where we are\nYeah and it is tragic because there are victims of these dangerous government policies you've been talking about and now we've seen this happen to a young five year old girls the results of this this was avoidable\nHad the school district recognize the dangers of this policy had there been people in the school board saying wait a second should we be adopting this policy\nUm but it's taken ... ... people like Pasha and her daughter to take a stand and say we're not going to be silent on this we're gonna take a stand for our rights because it impacts not just posh and her daughter not just even the kids in the cater but across the country as more and more school districts are adopting these dangerous policies\nWell I also just want to say how I'm going to the restroom or it ought to be a place of safety especially for young women and the idea that somebody can go into a place like that and have a physically strong mail whether it's the same age or older\nUh but but attack them or something like that that that shouldn't even be possible and of course here you know it it's a situation we don't know the details but uh it seems that it could be so much worse than what's been described here I mean here you have a five year old and a five or six year old\nBut a little boys can be strong but the point is once you talk about this general principle and you think about teenage kids and it it's just it's just a nightmare waiting to happen unless we have\nUnless reason prevails and unless a cool minds prevail in courts of law and we have folks like the alliance defending freedom defending these ideas\nAnd something really disgusting that I Will not mention on this air on the cake so ladies and gentlemen I ask you is somebody demanding that\nA

we're talking with Matt Sharp of the alliance defending freedom now Matt I when I was saying that I I Want to mention is so folks understand because typically we don't mention this what what jak Philips was asked to do\nWas disgusting it was pornographic is like a really sweet word to describe what this is this was absolutely foul sexual on a level that I wouldn't even dare try to explain it on the air because it was disgusting and it involved Satan right just in case and we just wondering where these people coming from right\nSo this is what we're dealing with right now and so this man has to go to court otherwise he's going to be forced to bake this I mean it's just\n... if every American is not outrage I Want to say to you where do you are legion says why we're we're in an existential battle for the soul of this country if you cannot stand with a man like this now what have we become\nAs a nation what have we become as a nation we once believed in in civil rights for African Americans that was a noble battle and and the African Americans when you think of Dr King the way he fought that battle he would never dream of anything vial\nLike this uh Rosa Parks was a woman a tremendous Christian dignity Jackie Robinson was a man of tremendous Christian dignity it's why\nWe went along with what they said they they shown a a mirror a light on us and we looked at ourselves in in in in a new light and we said you know what\nThey're they're right we need to change the way we think as a country we need to change our laws what we're talking about right now is as far from that\nAs you can imagine it is absolute found this absurdity it's playing games with people obviously a jak dogs is not really meant to make this could these people are looking for trouble the alliance defending freedom has to step in and defend this and I just want to say the folks\nYou need to understand this is an existential battle for the soul of this country we need to vote\nWe need to take action this is it's not okay that people are having to defend themselves against\nThis kind of violence this this should have been thrown out I mean nobody should have to take this seriously but right now jak Philips and others have to take that seriously in the ice defending freedom has to defend them I'm having met this is a really crazy cases it not\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the\nCivil rights commission that had just lost at the Supreme Court used jacks\nCase against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case to find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this\nCommission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs this isn't about letting him continue to operate as business and serve every body but give him the freedom to decline certain cakes this is saying\nWe hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that uh your average American really would would rather ignore this kind of stuff and I'm telling you folks\nAh one we're fighting a civil war when we were fighting the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight a and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody this is not us against them God Forbid the people on the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans is it's just not right and but we have to stand up so the least we can do I as I said his vote a please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't\nDon't do so many people have such excuses please if you don't vote don't ever complain again a and I want to say uh if you can give to the alliance defending freedom I don't know anybody\nThat is doing this a kind of work right now so I Want to say go to attacks us talk dot com you'll see the banner every penny you give will be doubled please give what you can\nAnd this is that folks this is why God gives us money\nAnd energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it it's tremendous because\nThey will come for you eventually you know of everybody just looks the other way uh eventually they're going to come for you and you're going to ask you to do something that violates your values you can go see

you say cure ...\nShe gets offended I got a better vaccine problem it's a real problem the problem okay I don't really know about it really are you really are Bradley jade bird's or of I really am of Hillsdale a college and uh as you know I'm a big fan of Hillsdale you've written a book on Andrew Jackson and the title is\nIn defense of Andrew Jackson now Andrew Jackson is a storied figure and without question a controversial\nFigure many people hate him um many people don't know about him I Am one of the latter I have to say I've heard this I've heard that but I'm not someone who knows very much about him uh I Know he was a so called Indian fighter a he's a hero of the war of Eighteen twelve\nUm but there's something about the time at which he was president that sometimes that's a a ...\nOr in people's learning you know we learn about the revolution we learned about the civil war but there's something about the time of Andrew Jackson maybe we missed it uh so I'm really thrilled that you've written a book on him and you can tell us about um so what do we need to know about him and why is your book titled in defense of Andrew Jackson\nInsured and thank you so much for having me like I remember very well when you came and spoke recommends but it was a real treat so it's great to make that connection and I also appreciate the bigger playing Ringo Starr that was that was licensed\nEntering a star is a big Jacksonian just in\nCase you want to ensure a huge absolutely oh\nThat would be great yeah I'm so let me let me just say that began distance really probably should have been title more accurately inclined\nIn defense of really probably should have been title more accurately and contacts rather than in that sense that there are certain things I think that are indefensible that Andrew Jackson\nAbout one of the reasons I wanted to approach it the way that I did and I I teach the period between the American revolution American civil war Hillsdale every year and it's a it's a blessing to be able to teach that\nOne of the reasons that I went this direction and part of it was a bit mischievous on my part part of it was marketing I've read or he's part but\nI just gotten so tired of how polarized things are and how much ... and has become a symbol really of all evil in early America\nSo I wanted to kind of challenge that and I do think there are things about it I mean you certainly very good for you know blown off by any means I\nHave a very very different kinds of characters and he's very different\nFrom other people have written a new Russell gr or by any means but\nHe was a fascinating figure and I think in so many ways for better and for wars he really was kind of a great\nAmerica at least in great representative of let friends here in America stood for in his own day and age so we're not going to be able to defend his slave holding or some of the things he did that I Would try to do that but I Do think that there\nI think the issues are very complicated from the time and what I found it at least in my own experience Eric going through Jackson's papers\nIn a way that we don't see that often in modern politics you will show on us and just so ... ... ... there's no there's no hiding with Andrew Jackson you know exactly where you stand with him no matter who you are\nWell send us an artist and blunt that's I guess one of the reasons many people have compared Donald Trump to Jackson is isn't that true\nYeah you know there are some similarities I think a bit of course there are differences too I think a lot of the things\nThe bad about Trump ... especially the kinds of whatever's going on in his life outside of his marriage um that kind of stuff is not stopped Jackson would have done it would have put up with is that you show moral bats it's another I think ... point in his favor or how much he revered his wife\nMarriage so Jackson took that seriously what was he did he considered himself a Christian Jackson or when we're with the ... in in that and\nHe's he's Eric it's a great question and he didn't quite a lot about it himself\nBut he narrative very developed whereas the area and and we know that he spent will be the last few years of his life not only as a devout Presbyterian but really spent the last nine years to life doing almost nothing but studying scripture and trying to get ready\nFor the next world and a ... he's a pretty stunning guy and I think if we wanted to think of them in that way the best way would be to say originally you kind of culturally Presbyterian but then he really grows into it as he gets older\nAnd okay so I think for people who know nothing about him and I'm I'm probably one of those sure uh let's I mean I'm I'm always happy to admit my I'm not happy doing my ignorance but I'm willing willing to admit my ignorance is but um if somebody says look I Know nothing about Andrew Jackson and why is he ... a great\nFigure why is he on our twenty dollar bill and why does he belong there who is he\nA tell us who is he and why would he rise to the level of being included you know on one of our most a used bills I mean that's a really prominent position it's not mount Russia right but it's really great Mexican well what is it about him that led\nUp people in the past to think of him that way\nYeah so you're from the lowly he entered on the scene in the Seventeen Ninety publicly as a controversial figure but just to give you a little bit of background Eric\nIt's MORNING Seventeen sixteen Seventeen dies in Eighteen forty five so ... is from the very last president we have who actually fought in the American revolution he was a preteen when he was fighting but he did actually fight as a twelve year old and then as a Thirteen year old or evolution\nBut he's also is the seventh president of the United states needs to be very different type of person for six right he's not permit Virginia we got an Adam's from New England\nYeah this is a guy who's from hardscrabble back frontier country in the Carolinas\nAnd by the Chinese Thirteen not only is he fought in the revolution but he's lost every family member so he's in the world

then he served two terms so if that's a a summary of the hopefully that's a good summer he just got to think about here's this spring tears when the scotch Irish guy who was kind of\nYour friends your hero almost the legendary get many God of his day like Daniel Boone ... Davy Crockett certainly had that kind of character but very different than the earlier presidents had had\nAll right and so how does he um what what are the things that he did a that would make people hate him or say that we should take him off of a twenty dollar bill\nWell so the two biggest things of course he's not guilty of this alone there were many people who are guilty of this he was a slave holder or he owns a number of slaves obviously slavery from any perspective as a moral and it's an evil\nBut even with in that ... that is he was seen as a good and evil system he was saying there's a link to a slave holder and certainly\nI don't really know I I guess I don't understand sorry to interrupt and say I don't understand how that becomes an issue because obviously all of the people of that era were slave holders so we know it's a horror but it really doesn't you know like when you think about uh any of them George Washington and Jefferson and and and all of them\nAre they were slave holders so I guess I'm thinking they're ... or something about him\nThat goes well beyond simply being a a slave holder in an Arab slave holding\nFlight so I think that gets lumped in generally

College professor Bradley birds or a friendly birds are welcome back it's fascinating to learn about this period in history and it really is\nPainful when you realize sometimes things are just ugly I mean it really is a difficult for us today to defend these actions it seems a callous um but it really is another universe when you think about the world of Eighteen twenty you're Eighteen thirty it's very hard for us\nOr to put ourselves in the shoes of those who lived then because it was obviously a much more brutal world\nSo I I think that's absolutely right Eric and you were saying right before break this was an era that you're not that familiar with I think that's true for most people even American historians to individual at that period you know we're always\nNo matter how liberal or PC the profession might be we still like dating everything by our wars right that there is no major war between the worthy equal to the next war which kind of forget that period\nI Want to get the Mexican war\nYes so we're just jump straight to the civil war and most people would go to war well yeah yeah yeah so it really is but\nOne of the things I Love Eric about it and I would appreciate this as well you know this is it time period it's jak St John Quincy Adams ... still alive Jefferson still alive or so or throw\nA girl and so there are some fascinating people alive at this time right and yeah that that's just to mention whites or you think about some of the Indians like Black Hawk or some of these other guys which is a fascinating time that all kinds of ways\nWell no I can think you know I can think of literary people from that time but as I say when I think of what the world was like first of all\nThe world was you know you you you can hardly think of um what what what would life be like in the frontier compared to what was life like in New York or Boston I mean it's just an amazing time of of growth\nUm so ... what what were the terms of Jackson's presidency or the years so\nHe was so nice elected in Eighteen twenty eight so it takes office was twenty nine and sitting there for two terms so in gun and thirty seven so twenty to thirty seven\nAnd he ... he really it it is interesting because he was even\nEarly on I mean I Know I Can't remember where I ... I read it but that ... even as a as a boy a he had controversy you were saying that he served as a twelve year old and a Thirteen year old in in the revolutionary war which is hard to imagine that a boy right today we don't we just can't imagine such a thing\nAnd that that he was captured by the British as as a as a boy that's right ah and and if there was this controversial thing that that he was commanded\nBy a British uh a colonel I guess\nTo clean the British officers boots and he refused I mean it's an amazing thing many young boy or a colonel I guess\nTo clean the British officers boots and he refused I mean it's an amazing thing any young boy that's very would refuse to do something he's a prisoner of war he's a boy what does he Thirteen Years old\nYeah uh he refuses and the officer slashed at him with a sword uh enjoy scarring him on his head in his hand for life and you think what kind of a human being\nOr would you become if you experienced that as a boy I mean that kind of brutality and then obviously a and the death of his brother and you know it's just another universe is doesn't excuse\nA sum sure he did but it's important for us to understand uh you know what life was like a in those days for some people not for all people but certainly for him\nAnd Eric you know I think it's important to note too that he really does come out of that very brutal scotch Irish culture\nSo it's not just that he's on the frontier but his mother who is a maze a woman and she died catching a disease helping American sailors and soldiers during the revolution that she gave her life essentially as a nurse but she taught him from day one as low scotch Irish children taught\nThat violence is the way men solve things and that that was ingrained in Jackson as what so many people on the Tennessee and Kentucky French years it was just very much a part of it\nWell it's just extraordinary I mean I Know that he he lost his mother when he was fourteen uh right and his his brothers and that he blamed the British for that and that's just one of those yeah his whole life and shake her forgave\nWhat do you do oh somebody over being put on the money [laughter] you know that's a nice little with numerous no but it was really in the Nineteen thirties that the west in boys yeah they do a great he\nWas going to say our energy in your wrote a book about an hour or

fall Todd Wilkerson ha hey it's air contacted shall we got to get serious okay we can't be kidding around all the time I have in the studio somebody that I like to call David Limbaugh\nDavid can claim that yes okay\nUh you've written a new book called Jesus is risen Paul in the early church we're talking about it yesterday I Want to continue the conversation\nJust because the doors are locked and you can't get out so this book that you wrote it's effectively a commentary like when somebody says I don't know reading the Bible is confusing you've written a whole bunch of books and this is the latest in that it's like a commentary you're helping to read or go verse by verse\nIn a common sense way in your explaining it when did you get the idea to start doing this for all of the New Testament because I just love it\nIt is so presumptuous when you think about that I that I decided to do that and it's so daunting and I don't mean that facetiously I mean who am I to be doing this uh\nYou know those people who know you are thinking exactly the same [laughter] I think you know what I Know David and it just doesn't make any human sense it's gotta be God that's that's the only explanation but does everybody knows you're not that talented oh not that smart so it has to be guy Dan how are you explain it\nI'm merely a vessel that as as a doctor titles set a pastor I an instrument of God's Grace you know it's it's um\nI don't know because I I I wrote the first Christian book man there's so many people born dollars willing and better at this than I Am and yet it came together in a way that I think it was accessible to people that my buddies couldn't my buddy theologian or pastors could probably not have raised a lot of ...\nAnd then I got the courage to do the next one that the Old Testament the pointing to Christ and I did the gospels and I don't know I really don't know every time I finish a book I I didn't write that somebody else wrote that I couldn't do that in the same thing with this one I got\nIt before I START I can't do this I got a call ... I I I signed a contract but I'm just kidding and but then I get into and I study immerse myself in in ... yes I can do this again and now I'm doing now twenty four seven violating the Sabbath four months to a to rewrite these things\nI don't know I just feel like there's there's something or to studying this and sharing it in a way of people that are on the level that I was I have an enthusiasm that I Want to impart to them or I think I can help set some people on fire and I've I've gotten great feedback on that I'm\nFrom a lot of readers and I don't know I don't it's just kind of my niche I Do think it's pretty bizarre that I'm doing this without having any formal\nTraining although it's not as I listen to you know teasing you I I did the same thing okay and of course you know we'd be an arrogant fools not to have a moment of doubt and humility into say indeed who am I to tell the story about the same time\nA scripture is full of stories where God just tell people to do stuff and they said oh I Can't do it in the end of the fact of the matter is if God has called you to do something you do it in obedience and you trust him with the results in the matter is that you have a gift of communication I find interesting your your brother\nIs it rust red ... rash also as a gift of communication and when you have a gifted communication which I I Am by God's Grace also have you want to use it\nTo help people and sometimes you can write a book on a on a subject people write books on subjects just like this book and it doesn't seem it doesn't speak it it sort of the kind of thing that it's a it's an effort to get through it\nThis is easy\nTo live\n... year college access show I'm sitting here with David Limbaugh who continues to write these marvelous books the new one is Jesus is risen Paul in the early church and and David\nMy first question in the segment is what do you need to do this show for your friends with Sean Hannity he has you on the show and the book goes to number one so what what are you why you're wasting your time you should just be writing another book back home where do you live a Cape drawn to Missouri You live in Missouri still I Love it here in Missouri man yes\nSons awesome great friend rush helps me mark within they all help me and I've been blessed you have a unique perspective a unique styled interview and your cerebral you bring up things that nobody else that I don't know is this a pay that\nYeah that was just gonna say I am I'm listening this is pretty good I better shut up\nBut I told I told Lauren that that's not my daughter Laurent with regular I told you that before this yeah this is interviews or a\nMale you know speaking of ... is the publisher of your book regular he's also the publisher of my book\nIs called Donald drain the swamp and I'll tell you something I spent months\nThinking about writing that book and I spent an afternoon writing that book and it is a fable and I think John's going to have me on his program to talk about that you'll see when you read it because it's actually a\nIt is so shallow that anybody can understand that but it's really stupid and it's really fun but ... is the publisher so we share a publisher we share a face yeah uh we were both uh kids in Missouri actually that's not true I was in ... but we're both kids\nAnd here we are in the same room with what are the odds of this it's unbelievable ... Jim credible okay so your book you were just going on to say\nThat the the the figure in this book because it talks about Paul Saint Paul in the early church\nThis takes us really from the gospels into act right yes so suddenly Jesus is crucified he is\nA resurrected from the dead forty days later he is sent to heaven and then everybody standing around thinking okay now what do we do like a he's gone he's resented into having we know we rose from the dead\nWe many of us saw him we talk to him but\nThen we enter what's called the early church and that's what your book talks about is like weird did what happened in those years I'm forty BC fifty bc as Paul and Peter and the other apostles kind of fan out through the early world I'm a ... of that day um\nAnd we were at the point where you said Paul this incredible prosecutor Christians is on a horse on his way to Damascus he's causing a lot of trouble people are scared to death of this guy yeah and he's blinded by the light knocked off of his horse and basically has the ultimate conversion experience\nBy the way you said forty BC\nEighty we've got to make sure the readers\nDon't never correct me and my radio show yeah sorry uh somebody saying that I'm Sorry forty eight the ladies and gentlemen and no dome in the very you know you're the lord okay and so yeah\nYeah so So Paul ... is one of the greatest apologetic a fat or moments or evidence is that\nPaul who is this a persecuted her art in labor of our our ... this labor of Christianity becomes the greatest convert and Christ commissions him to be the apostle to the gym tiles\nAnd the ... means be non Jews and non Jews and yeah it is are they call them in the Bible Greeks can you relate to that you know isn't that interesting is they they limit Greeks you think and and it says but now it says in Christ there's neither you nor Greek yes but only lithuanians [laughter]\nAnd I've spent a lotta manuscripts and look into it and help but isn't that interesting that that\nPaul was appointed specifically\nTo speak to those outside of of the Jewish community now you know it doesn't mean that he didn't speak to people in the Jewish community to convince them that Jesus as messiah but he was specially commission to go to those who were not part of the Jewish community did not go to synagogue and it said to them oh by the way the God\nThat we Jews have worshiped is now available to you through Jesus and God chose the Jewish people to bring a faith in him to the whole world and now the time has come that everybody beyond the world of of the Jews\nKimball leaving the God of the Jews through Jesus he's the bridge and the time is now I mean it's an it's pretty amazing\nPretty amazing and and also amazing and as told in this book which is about the Bible\nThat Paul always retained his heart for the juice for his people and he tries tries to convince them of the authenticity of this message in of Jesus Christ that he is really the messiah and in fact the book of Romans\nIn part as a lament he's suffering so much agony over the idea that he can't convince so many of his Jewish brothers that Christ is the messiah\nOr and and he talks about ultimately Jews coming around by the way I don't want to offend any do I believe that\nThat we believe that Christ is the fulfillment of the Old Testament and not the abolition of it or not the abolition of the cabinet but the fulfillment of it and at the New Testament is a continuation of the Old Testament completes the picture\nBut I think that Christians authentic Christians have a heart for Jews and we don't we everybody has the same under Christ and you just said there's no great there's no ... it everybody is offered this gift to salvation [noise] uh and\nPaul is you see the agony as he writes or to the early churches who we're deviating from the message\nAnd you see what a raw human being he is and he and he was writing just like it's today because human beings and human nature hasn't changed in two thousand years\nWe're falling people made in God's image which is another paradox and yet fall and Paul rights and pleads with these churches that he found that he feels like they're\nThat he gave birth to them in a literal sense and that his kids are going off the path and he wants to bring 'em back in a disciplinary sense to the true word of God not for his benefit but for theirs and they also will become ambassadors to other Christians and and producers in multiples in that sense throughout the Roman empire and throughout the world in history\nAnd so this is a story these fissile pause writing of these people but the same problems we fear experience today\nThey're they're they've got falls teachers coming in their ... puffed up on their own false stories trying to build their own legal or maybe maybe demonic Lee inspired to get people off the gospel\nBut and they're they're in disarming in their churches there they're making a mockery of the lord supper and fighting and he's telling given a practical advice practical mundane advice how they get back\nTo the spiritual practices and then he's also in getting very lofty as to Christian doctrine and he this is preserved these weren't scripture when he wrote them and they were but nobody knew and preserve their letters to individual churches are individuals\nAnd now they are preserved by God's Providence to become letters for all Christians so that we can be\nFBI isn't is amazing I mean I I always want to say because I Know there's somebody out there listening who doesn't\nKnow when Christians talk about the book of Romans or the ... whatever what do we mean by that what we mean is that this man Paul uh is traveling around the ancient world creating churches creating Jesus a bull believer groups here and here\nAnd hearing here but then it keeps traveling and the only way you can communicate with them is to write these letters so he hears things from them they write letters to him\nAnd the letters that he wrote to them we can just imagine what's going through his mind he's not just like oh let me just down if you know these thinking this is this may be the only thing I get to say to this group of people so he takes tremendous pains\nTo school them in doctrine what's right what's wrong so there's all kinds of the logical stuff in there and then as you just had this practical stuff that he hears about arguments about communion or this or that\nAnd he puts it all down not knowing that this would become a part of the Bible it's a it's kind of an amazing\nThing it's an amazing thing and in another parallel thing\nIt's grounded in actual history just like\nThe entirety of Christianity is grounded in the history of Jesus as badly resurrection so here's Paul not writing some abstract theological doctrine\nThat's untethered to real historical events he's living this experience and under the Holy Spirit a empowerment he's writing these letters to the church that are that are steeped in practical advice and doctrine\nNot knowing that they're only going to be available to us right in a transcendent way\nHow cool is that I was literally that's what's so cool is that when you say in a transcending way when he was writing them as you're saying he didn't understand that they would become scripture for everybody that he just thought I'm just writing\nTo the specific group of people either in Rome or in colossus or in a delay show or one of these places he's writing to them but the way he wrote God used it to reach Christians for ever and ever and ever it becomes the word of God\nIn and they but they have this idea that that those of us who believe this really are a bunch of village idiots who who haven't even considered that the the uh\nReasons not to believe in that we didn't have the same doubts ourselves we of course we had the same doubts herself but now you were convinced anyway\nThat see that's the thing I mean I I Know that you and I we had ... we have so much doubt that we didn't believe it yeah and then\nSomething happened folks are we're going to be right back talking to David Lynch bought the book is Jesus is

into scripture better and and as you say that they do they will survive\nOr to some extent I don't have any idea and and again I don't take personal credit for whatever it is and this is a false

Theresa foreign and uh they're going to be with me for this hour to talk about their new book it's called get out now why you should pull your child from public school before\nIt's too late I'm I've spoken many times on this program program about the um\nThe toxicity of\nYou know the culture in which we live and unfortunate fortunately that's the situation in the public schools so if you as a parent a ... and I as a parent to ... you know we we send their kids off to school what are they learning what the culture of that\nEnvironment it's supposed to be in local per rent is right the whole reason your public school you pay taxes so that they can teach your kids because you can't because you've got a different job right\nAnd they're supposed to be really doing what you want them to do frankly okay you're paying your taxes this is not like some government bureaucracy that gets to tell you when did you ... they're supposed to be doing the job that that you've hired them to do by paying taxes and as we know that's not the way it works so are the two women to whom I Will talk in a moment or Theresa front and Mary rice\nHassan a Theresa teaches at the St Paul seminary in Pittsburgh she's taught philosophy a Franciscan University of Steubenville\nA which is what I call an actual Catholic university not a fake Catholic university like Georgetown uh she she has many many other um a\nCredentials which I I won't read now a merry rice Hassan is the hate burn\nFellow in Catholic studies at the ethics and public policy center in Washington DC wow uh she was the keynote speaker for the Holy See during the un commission on the status of women in twenty Seventeen and she's written for the federalist uh and and on and on and on and I'm thrilled\nTo have to resist burning in Mary rights has been on the line right now welcome to the program\nThanks so much Eric\nI'm now this book is a very dramatic dramatically title to get out now why you should pull your child from public school before it's too late I\nHave my self made the case generally speaking that this is how I feel as well but you take an even stronger stand a so let me ask both of you and you can talk as you like uh what is it that led you to this dramatic\nMoments to to not only write a book on the subject but you write a book that takes such a dramatic stand on this issue\nYou know air both of us are in positions where we're talking constantly to parents around the country and we were hearing sort of a lament with parents saying my my child who is now in college or it's a young adult\nThe longer it goes to church or they become so progressive in their their idiot allergy and they're they're leaving behind the values and the belief that we were trying to train in my pin and so\nWe've both been hearing this and we started dating and because there's been a lot of focus on the radicalization that's occurring on college campuses you know telling our kids left for the what we found out\nWas that the data shows this occurred in elementary school and then in high school that that we're losing our kids\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThey both his ear protector show I'm Talking with Mary right past and and Theresa foreign them about their new book titled get out now why you should pull your child from public school before it's too late or and Marion Theresa welcome back thanks so much\nA this is such an important conversations to try to understand how this all happened so you're talking about John do eat a philosopher\nWho had an outsized influence on the American education system and part of what he brought to the equation was this idea of pragmatism as a philosophy in other words we're just going to talk about what is we're not going to talk about what ought to be or what should be or what is better morally we're not going to do that\nRight and we're seeing that Eric even in terms of the departure from science so one of the game changed for us as we looked at this and looked at what parents are facing in the schools is the transgender agenda which has just come in\nAnd is permeating the school culture not to mention in many cases changing the rules in terms of bathrooms in terms of participation athletic teams and\nUse it pronouns and all that sort of thing but what's happening there is that our children are being instructed that what did they learn about the human person that you're born male or female is not true that\nThere is what really matters is weather person identifies as male or female or not binary or something else in these genders or multiplying so that\nIt's a pragmatic view in the sense of paying for what's happening people's feelings are taking them here that must be that's what we do with there's a departure from scientific truth which tells us that every cell in your body is either male or female and the can't change even if you have surgery or take hormones\nBut our children are being taught to disregard that\nAnd to go with someone else's feelings of what's true but\nOur kids are drawn into that you know this kind of magical thinking they had to participate in that\nWell this goes way way way back in other words I remember I'm back or cs Lewis in the abolition of man\nI Believe it was in that book that he ... he begins the book with a discussion of this very thing and so I guess he was writing this in the forties but this had already taken root\nIn England back then that that the children were had a gun to be taught differently and it was more about feelings and less about ... what is actually true which is that that somehow your feelings\nCan Trump the reality so it's like we moods beyond materialism it's it's there's irony here right in other words if you you have\nAnd and I I'm just guessing this traces all the way back to the romantic movement but something happened in the nineteenth century and so this goes way way way back but you're telling me that it's finally too cold in American education with John do\nWell and and Eric I I Would add um I guess the question\nOh and and Eric I I Would add um I guess the question\n\n... sorry\nChasing\nDo have we lost her one of our or people I Will ... will try ... will try to get them back I'm right now is our and me I mean well Mary yeah you can leave\nSo it's a one of the one of the issues here is that um parents and along which onto his philosophy is is this idea that what happens in in the family and is\nSort of separated so parents as we're looking at these radical changes in the public school where where kids are being taught that yes they're born male or female well that doesn't necessarily mean anything it you have to figure out your feelings is that parents are being fenced out\nAnd so I'm really relate a little incidents I a friend of mine was telling me that she was\nUm volunteering at her her public school um during playground Judy her daughter is a kindergartner and her daughter was one of those girls who\nWas a tomboy she just wear T shirts shorts rough and tumble and all this stuff\nAnd yet she knew she was a girl but one of the teachers came over to to this mom and and said well we can see your daughter's exploring her gender we are trying to support that in other words they were pushing her to identify more with the boys\nAs opposed to saying you're a girl who likes to rough and tumble things and and so if that mother had not been standing there she would never have known this this push that her daughter was kidding she she pulled her daughter out\nThere that is I mean that a staggering and I and I want to say you know to my listeners that\nBasically this is a good example of why\nThe thesis of of your book and I know we we we have to read the back the thesis of this book get out now why you should pull your child from public school before it's too late um is apt because when you describe a situation like this my blood boils the teacher\nWould dare would dare to cross that line and to do to impose his or her morality\nOn my child that unacceptable and frankly is a great irony here the separation of church and state dictates that that ought not to happen in other words that write my faith is supposed to be sacrosanct and so when you have the government in the form of a public school teacher stepping in\nAnd imposing his or her\nFaith view or you could say lack of faith you whatever it is it doesn't matter it's a faith view on my child that is actually unconstitutional\nRight but what's happening here is they they um cover themselves by saying first of all this stuff comes in most easily you know the anti bullying program if you're doing an anti playing program you got to teach kids all of that algae beauty cute kids and all the definition gender identity gender expression\nBut but then what happens and this is written into the school regulations excuse me now of many schools where they face civically that because many algae P. T. Q. children are not accepted at home the school needs to be the gatekeeper to protect her\nTo shield that child and not reveal anything that's going on at school if that child is showing some gender confusion not reveal that without the child's permission\nSo this is really being written in with this creating a an assumption really hit parents not only can't decide what's in the best interests of their child but they can't be trusted right and that's a school yeah to be in that right\nI uh you know because we only have an hour let me cut to the chase this is a panic or when I hear that bureaucrats who do not love our children\nAre are presuming to step in to push the parents are who are in many cases half kill themselves to feed these kids and the clothes these kids to take care of these kids to change the diapers to love them\nWhen those people are being pushed out because some bureaucrat has been given the authority\nTo to do that we are\nAt a dramatic impasse and so I Want to underscore the title of your book is get out now I mean I think the problem for a lot of people is how do I get out the public school is free uh where do I go I mean I think this is why so many people push for school vouchers and those kinds of things\nWere Erica one that one of the things that were\nSort of running into that when we have all we we can get that response\nFrom parents what do we do and and I just wanted\nTo return back um I I Want to emphasize that they can you know problem if you're a pastor and you're listening to this broadcast look around in your church they kick in your congregation are blooming aggressively avenge\nAlive or secular and says no one that we see the number of millennials practices phone drop and the numbers with the next generation I don't and I will be if\nIt even a lower and so that the responsibility while I have the parents have a responsibility for my own children\nOf a political who don't have children or who are in position to help Marshall and resources and try to come come together I think a creative solution for everyone if you are involved in a church need to look around and try to find a way to educate your young people\nWell I mean you can have a ... this is the whole thing is that I Know so many people in these people to me that they are heroes\nThey are home schooling their kids it blows my mind that they can do this but then you find people that are home schooling their kids and they don't seem to be as amazing anything how're you doing it and then they tell you well um we have different ways to do it there are other families are in the neighborhood or in the town who do this\nAnd we so the idea that you yourself have to home school your kid there's a whole network\nOr with all kinds of resources so that's that's a very real option I think a lot of people aren't aware of that\nRight and that's one thing I mean I Would emphasize here at home schooling today is radically different from what it was before the because of the Internet because of the availability of of collapsed because it's it's just much easier to accomplish it and it's no longer kind of the ... thing that it was maybe Thirty years ago or something\nRight and ... to the political reality is\nLegislators have been doing the minimum as far as things like vouchers go and part of it is because they haven't had to do more they don't want to rock the boat and if they realize that Christian parents who are looking at this ... this is that this is not good for our kids are kids are out of here\nYou can bet that they're going to be responsive and start talking about really letting the money so I Try\nI Want to talk about this when we come back focus your taxes show this is very important conversation stick around for you

D divorce has tried to take this on at the federal level but this is dramatic I mean we do need to give our people options especially when they when this ugly option other than the public schools is a is is the main one\nRight so what's happening with the vouchers as in states that do have voucher programs they typically limit them my income they limit them by number so you might have only three thousand children in a particular area who are allowed to use vouchers they limit them in terms of funds\nAnd that's not at all the same thing and a wide open voucher program that acknowledges that the parents as taxpayers\nAre have already put in the money to educate their children and so they ought to be able to take that money or at least a portion of it even given how much states are spending per child sometimes ten Fifteen thousand dollars per child even if you're gay parents half of that\nAnd allow them to use it to you is tutor supplemental services to afford private schools to home school whatever it might be parents are going to make a far better decision and they'll get the education they want but but we have a lot of um [noise]\nI hate to say this but kinda cowardly legislators who are cowed by the education unions and biology advocacy unions who say you can't disrupt the public schools and my question to them is\nIt are the public school is doing what we want them to do they're they're turning out kids who are politically left who have no faith\nWho are gender confused I wear activists in in the you know sort of left wing sense is that really where most legislators if you put it like that is that really where they think the taxpayers want their money to go we need to create alternative\nWell it really is a it is shocking that legislators I mean I tend not to think of politicians is being courageous people um but in this case\nIt is up to the people which is to see the voters to make them understand you must do this we demand that you do this or this is why we elected you\nRight in there a lot of um uh how how they put an obfuscation here when it comes to the dialogue surrounding this you can't mention ... so that people complaining that you're trying to defund the public schools\nBut actually if you look at um the proposals that are out there they only preserve the operating costs for the school and then they they take the money that the instructional cost per student\nSo that\nThe public schools are not they find that they really don't they don't have the same amount of money\nThey will need to educate those children right any amount of money to get into the parents certainly not a huge chunk that normally allocated per student because every single proposal reserve the operating and so\nThat that's one of one of the problem here is that\nTeam in many cases to be up to the to the to the challenge or we're out of time Mary and Theresa God Bless you and thank you so much for this book\nAnd they hate you for having\nFolks or
