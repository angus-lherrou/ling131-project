that's what I said I said listen I nothing would shock me this is a set up it also could be just a deranged not job and it turned out to be a deranged not job and and there are people that are still not convinced by the way I'm just\nThere's something that's just not writes a third thing I think you need to know is that listen this caravan\nUm\nThis caravan is still about four thousand people or so and apparently there's a report out that\nThe people walking now through Mexico were offered housing in jobs in Mexico and they said no we want America we want America that's that's what they want I Know a thousand a thousand Honduran migrants\nHave broken through a Guatemalan police cordon and even this morning I'm watching Fox has been prepping at three o'clock in the morning and\nGreg Jenkins is out there and he said we are right now he's imbedded with this caravan he said we're walking through a Mexican checkpoint and nobody is stopping them to check them\nGood job Mexico [noise] [noise] good job in Mexico three things I think you need to know so\n\nWhen we're shooting ever worst attack on Jews in the history of America which by the way next Israel the most friendly country to Jews\nThat's on the planet ever we are\nSo this guy is a piece of garbage Nazi who hated Trump describe you looked at his social media and just so you know this and again it's about the victims we burials there'll be a there'll be people sitting ... which means you comfort you come for these people that have lost their loved ones um you comfort them with\nWith prayers with love with food that's what that's what I was used do\n\nAnd\nThis guy was just a flat out not see he said Trump is a global is not a nationalist any is controlled by the Jews\nAre just so you know because these are details that are not actually being talked about on the news on that if you watch the media about this besides the horror that actually took place\n\nAll they're talking about is somehow Trump inspired this guy to do this\nAnd it's sickening\nIt's disgusting it's gross there's no reason this should actually happened but the media is so blind with their hatred of Trump they're going to literally capitalize on these people that were murdered\n\nTwenty minutes twenty minutes is what this guy took twenty minutes he's walking in different rooms and just shooting people and and the original reports you had an assault rifle in assault going assault weapon assault weapon that's what assault weapon\nEvery weapon is an assault weapon and one one of the best things that listener ever told me is that as a teacher he said I told my students what does the salt loving me and I can pick up the stool and hit you with that it's an assault still\n\nGetting their Fifteen some hand guns\nAnd he\nJust went in there and there were different events happening one was a brisk which is when a child is eight days old and I'm\n\nA day it's it's a naming ceremony basically it is and it's what a braces and ah there's other things that happened that we won't get into um Ryan witness mice my late at night and my youngest son's\nWrists you were there you know it's very honored and thinking that the only thing I'm Glad you were there your good friend so we you know we personally have gone through this stuff\nAnd\nThis guy just basically said that he he hated Jews he hated Jews he hated refugees he hated migrants ... everybody and he also again hated Trump\n\nHe hated Trump he called the Jews the children of Satan\n\nOn some crazy social media sites\n\nHe said highest likes to bring invaders in that kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screener optics ongoing in highest is the Hebrew immigrant aid society and that that temple helps people that are refugees\n\nHe said also there is no ... as long as there is an event to horrible word for Jews Jew infestation\n\nHe told that law enforcement they're committing genocide to my people I just wanted to kill the Jews\n\nThat's what this guy said there's nothing else this guy was jacked up in the head is Jack up in the head of the guy that shot up the baseball field with the Republicans playing on his jacked up in the head\nAs the guy that sent the the fake bombs uh the the the the look alike bombs\n\nTo Democrats these people are mental mental and what do we see on the news\nTrump inspired this guy to do its Trump's showing this Trump somehow responsible Trump's anti Semitic\n\nI've never seen such insanity in my life just when I thought I couldn't get any worse than the cabinet hearings and it was really bad\nAnd by the way who called for all those people to get crazy get up in people's faces\nI mean it's it's the Democrat he'd say it's a ... I don't hate it it is what it is the Democrats it's almost as if this was\nOnce again\nA team effort between the media and the Democrats because\nWhat\nI saw in highlights of the news and watching it and watching interviews and everything else throughout the weekend\nI didn't see anything about why didn't I didn't see any anger any reporter and he counted they were talking about this guy hating Trump\nIt's like they didn't want people to notice\nThey just said he was the Nazis full of hate and he's being and saying Trump's got some responsibility um all this stuff right that's what he does responsibility trumps the one who is ready to dog whistles that's what we have soundbite does this dog whistles that are doing this and it's as if\nTrying to team up and Democrats are saying the same thing the Democrats in the media are literally mimicking each other and one of the one of the talking points it was brought up was George\nRose George Soros is not a good guy\n\nGeorge Soros is also Jewish and the Democrats in the media all of a sudden\nBrought up this thing that well the Republicans don't like George Soros and Trump doesn't like him because he's Jewish\nIt's his face\nAnd I'm like are they really going there it's not the fact that he actually bets against America like the best in an organization that cause chaos\nSocialism\nThe man doesn't like America it has nothing to do with his his religion but all of a sudden you're creating this talking point well Trump hate Soros Seabrook saw a lot\nAnd he rips Tom Steyer this billionaire that was talking out and Tom stiers dad was Jewish\nThe hell knows that\nSo all of a sudden it's there's just this big talking point this big kind of conspiracy theory\nThat\nTrump hate Soros not because of what sources doing to America and trying to cause chaos throughout the world in Europe as well\nIt's because he's Jewish and we don't want to let you know that this not see that shot this shot up this synagogue is mass murderer\nWe don't want to you know that he age Trump because that would go against well everything you would say well wait a second how does that make sense of what's going on here and\nSo instead they just focus on this and it was like a team effort between the Democrats in the media to make that happen you tell me if you were watching where one time any of these people brings up the fact that this guy\nHated Trump never they didn't do it not that I saw I didn't and I watched a lot they didn't do it\nBut remember you know what the media did bring up that that guy that sent those uh those bombs I wouldn't

everybody hates Trump rights\n... not so much about the bookies the bookies are now given odds that the Republicans keep the house\nThey don't lose money they're not in the business to lose money and

on but I Want you to know it don't get to the media stuff\nA big story and they held the headline Trump can refuse to accept asylum applications\n\nWhy when here's Nielsen's like you can't stay here which you should say you can't\nI'm here we don't have to have just 'cause they say we want asylum doesn't mean that we have to accept it I'll get into that that's a big deal isn't it yeah you are a little bit\nAt least one other stuff to talk about we play in the last hour Trump right away condemning it not once but twice by the way he was in uh where where is the first one um I forget where the Kentucky somewhere then I went to Murfreesboro Illinois Saturday and he once again condemned the attack on the synagogue\nHe said and evil anti Semitic attack is an assault on all of us and that's just some of it that's just some of what he said he said he said a lot of things and\nUh it's it's just gross hearing what the media said we're going to get into that right now I've been teasing it throughout the morning there isn't who reads GQ you every GQ I've never I've seen it who reads your e and by the way do you get GQ for the articles\nIsn't GQ for like guys fashion or something like that apparently they have a political writer named who is Jewish Juliet you off\nLet's start with her one twenty four\nShe was on CNN sheets weeded out all kinds of crazy stuff she actually blame Trump I mean you can't make up this stuff she blamed Trump for the shooting you won't want to know why she said this guy decided to shoot up is anti Semitic idiot decided to shoot up the temple\nBecause Trump move the embassy in Israel to Israel's capital\nI'm not making that up\nThat's what she said she tweeted that and then she doubled down and triple down and people were ripping her and she said no no no no no this is true this is true\n\nYeah you can't make up this stuff so she was on CNN\nAnd despite all the examples I just gave you what was in a half an hour ago everything Trump has done for the Jews in America and in Israel\nUm I Want you to hear what she had to say about Trump apparently not being on the side of the Jewish community here we go\nI think that ... and heightened a lot of people who said the dog with all the adults all\nThey failed at that price approve fat fat as much if you look at All right commentary after ... Charlotte ... has inability to impel rarely for ... for like David Gale foreign ground with a KKK [noise]\nThey understand that and they understand the full on their side he's on the side of of\nFrankly at the Jewish community again everything I said that he has done\nIs done more for Israel than I can I can recall any other president in my lifetime\nSick sick\nSo uh she said that when Wolf Blitzer and I left it in here you've got to hear this she Dodgers of Trump's a to a dog whistle everything I've played by the way of condemning the attacks in the strongest way possible\n\nNot good enough so we'll brings up the fact that the guy and this is very rare that he actually brought this up that this this anti Semitic idiot hated Trump and listen or dodge it one twenty five listen to this area\nIs a shooter this killer a he posted a lot of anti Semitic posts on social media but he also went after\nDonald Trump or you said at one point a trucker surrounded\nBy then to use the derogatory word for juice the search for the tape or things that will say the chorus truck is a global is not a national is there is no ... make America make America great again as long as there is a derogatory or cable refrigerators infestation so luckily it was a great fan of done\nLately I think this rhetoric is out there in the air out their attacks on jars her as how that's how loud level at that wow how badly vows and they ... they are anti next ... at the president is half ... and hadn't traffic and [noise]\nFor at least that there has to start in right and that's not a coincidence that this will pick up on that and I think now if you're talking about that actually do something about that they get so around that that they don't like it has it's not enough\n[noise] doesn't matter\nThis was her tweet by the way on October twenty seven and a word to my fellow of American Jews this president makes this possible here where you live I Hope the embassy move over there where you don't live was worth ...\n\nYou can't get any more dumb that she was featured all weekend long the cable news\nYou heard the George Soros we're gonna play more of this this hour\nThere's this there's this ... it seems like collusion\nBetween the media and the Democratic party because nobody to media that was the first the only time you hear anybody Wolf Blitzer let it out and this chick couldn't address it which is why they're not talking about it\nI haven't heard anybody talk about have you the fact that this guy hated Trump because how could this guy he hated Trump how can anybody make the claim it it it defies logic how can you make the claim\nThat Trump actually inspired him to shoot up the temple\nIf he hated Trump how did Trump inspire him to shoot up the temple again Trump booted out the Nazi in Queens you move the the embassy which is what all Jews won most she was actually the ... most wanted\nA cutting off aid to the Palestinians are got rid of the Iranian deal and there's so many things that he's done and yet this is this demented with this chick said and wrote and everything and she couldn't address it because again it doesn't make any sense ... she brought up this thing about George Soros\nOh George Soros is Jewish George source is a bad man\nThe media is trying to make it\nThe moral equivalent now that if you say anything about bad about George Soros you're saying bad things about Jews which is the dumbest thing I've ever heard my entire life George Soros is a bad man he he is trying to he pays for chaos he pays for turmoil you profits off of it he wanted to happen\n\nSo if you rip George Soros it doesn't mean it's a dog whistle that you want anti Semitism to happen ripping George sources about George Soros not as religion yeah this is what the media is trying to push a matter of fact\nI have more of that let's get into it let's let's play real quick real quick real quick um one thirty seven Adam Schiff with Jake Tapper on CNN crazy Adam Schiff\nListen to what Adam Schiff whip to soundbites because one day to go to break right after and then we'll we'll continue with one thirty seven uh tapper brings up George Soros here we go listen to this\nUh George Soros a is a billionaire financier or his Jewish she's the founder of a lot of\nProgressive causes I'm somebody who's in the political arena certainly um you know open themselves up the criticism do you think all the criticism coming from the right about George Soros all of it is anti Semitic some of it ...\nUh well I don't know what I can say all of it or some may have a have an issue with George Soros is an open society organization or foundation but I think much of it most of it\nWhat what\nAre you kidding me right now there's one more that'll just knock off your socks and we're going to get that you only get back on the other side and about five um we got to get to that one and and you want to hear it cause you you were going to play under soundbites also this hour of the media saying Trump is inspiring this\nI have a soundbite that was on MSNBC where they called for somebody putting a bullet and Donald Trump\n\nIs not a dog whistle actually it's it's those words will get to all this don't go anywhere can as the Ames seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk so\nUh people don't do fact checking so many things that they say it's gonna be taken at face value or verbatim or absolute truth nobody has any kind of or\nIt's a losing we just have to keep doing our ground or you appreciate you everything that you do for a little bit so we can all here ridiculous most of it and if you\nI applaud you for bringing us for the light and showing it because I Can't hear you everything myself\nNo you have a job I have a life this is my job\n[laughter] so fake but that's the reason they don't they don't want to have a discussion boy any kind of a ... I Know that some of these people they know that they're being over ... what's going on for whatever they um\nThat's how sick they are and then they got an X. level why going you know by going nuts with the Kavanaugh situation I mean again they've called Trump an anti Semite forever and its own his own family is Jewish or he's at least in one of his biggest advisors is Jared Kushner his son in law who is Jewish\nAnd this is they debated literally makes is zero sense but they don't want people you know that that's where I played Trump talking about or his condemnation of the shootings and then I played by no soundbite Trump didn't condemn the shooting what are you nuts\nHe's a great work keep exposing it because I Can't hear everything and the more you expose the more people see and see the real truth\n... thank you didn't take care man a really quick\nWe have the uh the style of the time so I play one forty one real quick Tom's dire billionaire left you know juggle have trouble he does is make commercials about wanting to impeach Trump I mean it's it's like a sickness Trump's living in his head rent free or Tom style goes on CNN and actually said this or we go\nI think his response to the tragedy is was appropriate\nBut something much bigger than that going on here which is the atmosphere that she's created he's a Republican Party has created terms of political violence oh look across the political fame what you see is routine systematic lawlessness an attempt to break\nSmall D democratic norms\nIn pursuit of victory at all costs\n... events where the Democrats are so you heard that right you heard that you're that he's creating a political violence let me bring to you from MSNBC and twenty Fifteen Rick Wilson Rick Wilson might be as Tucker Carlson said the dumbest man on TV ... dumber than Don Lemon one thirty nine\nBack in twenty Fifteen what was the primary in Trump is battling Republicans Rick Wilson was asked to comment on Donald Trump and the odds of winning and the establishment is on MSNBC and they still haven't back the Senate this year we go\nBut here's the thing Trump is silly very powerful force right now ... and he's still holding a lot of uh of of the the part of the base that is very activated by his message the native is the message that that that that's got a a fresh from the base very energized\nAnd the donor class can't just sit back on the sidelines and say oh well don't worry this all work itself out\nThere are so gonna have to go out and put a bullet and Donald Trump and that's a fact\nMSNBC yep yep yep yep\nWe have more violence coming from the rides a Trump gives anti Semite license to commit atrocities\nAll this stuff did you hear by the way Marsha Blackburn Congress woman running for Senate in Tennessee tried

I have done everything conceivably ...\nYes or no they they have to be you that's why you're fighting for this I mean if they weren't if they weren't stopping in interfering you wouldn't be all over the place saying I Need this money to get people safe so they are literally stopping or your your guys\nFrom doing their job which is to keep bad guys out stop drug traffickers you name it right that is correct so then they're they're interfering so you know what you would have such leverage ... says you would have hand\nAnd and you can sit back and say you know you're going to ... and ... are you guys going to really challenge me are you guys are really going to say that you have no problem stopping need from protecting the good people the citizens of Pima County because you are the resistance and you have Trump I mean you would when there's no chance that you would lose your\nA hundred percent correct they'll do it um it ... this stage in his autonomy thing the one thing that they've said needed Lee yeah that ice imbedded in the jail was these stopping block\nSheriff this these stopping blocked they said that before you did is correct okay now we've done that and so we're moving any other objections sooner or later the only thing left Garrett\nWell but now there you go at it so now that you did that right you did that why don't they say to you okay fine I have your grandma\nBecause that's the the one that's in the ... and the one that I've submitted the federal government is the two thousand Nineteen grant request I'm confident the federal government's going to award us that money the board of supervisors has the chance to do the right thing I have consistently done the right thing that you've\nDone it over and over you've given either find will get ice out of my jail which makes me upset\nMy wife upset which of course makes me more upset because I got to deal with that and then you have the situation of these guys all they do is move the goalposts like how can you trust what they say when they go back on their word\nOver and over there creating an amazing paper trail aren't they\nBut they don't thing ever happened to this is like with Hillary and the rest and we get done already because nothing ever happens\nWell to the thing that will happen is we're going to request um two thousand Nineteen grant money the other thing that we're going to do\nAnd the next several weeks is start doing what we're going to call the Pima County ... safety initiative where we're gonna have to fund this as taxpayers and Pima County which is unfortunate the federal government is begging me to take money to do these task\nI still have an affirmative responsibility to do them that has not changed so we're going to have to do a lot of what we were doing was stoned garden with local tax dollars and I'll find that money and my budget I'm good at doing that\nSo we'll start to point our resources as we have under stone garden but we're gonna have to pay for that as taxpayers\nSooner or later even the Democrats are going to get tired of this do you regret given the five million dollars back that you said you cut in the budget because now you're going to find more money to help pay for over ... I don't regret that because I came back about eighty eight percent of that came back to my people and compensation and I needed the money\nAnd I use that money as leverage to try to get some pay for my corrections officers one deputies and and people so no I don't regret doing that part at all because\nWe're really having a trouble recruiting and retaining\nHere's the thing share of is that is that all\nA lot of Pima County residents my listeners anybody else they see you giving in to these people and they haven't given an inch and we have done we as citizens we liked the fact that I was there so there's an illegal alien they hand them right off we felt better because of that\nAnd and we have done nothing wrong the only people that have done something wrong or the three supervisors had voted to say we hate Trump so much we don't give a damn about the safety of the residents of Pima County yet what you did is instead of going after them you've made us less safe\nNo we haven't um if I thought that was the case we would have never done that let's talk about the the actual space they had in the jail okay is under use cubicle originally conceptually what we thought would happen is that they would inhabit that about sixteen hours a day seven days a week ...\nTheir connectivity problems in the jail that made it hard for them to work there I could not use county resources to help them with their connectivity issue because but I Would have to go to the board for that\nSo they would say no we can I get why yeah that that are you know if that that is exactly correct so they could move to a different part of the of the jail no there's going to Seventy there were just as well when you get into the ... the jail in you're in the bowels of the jail and I had one on her use lies place so they were infrequently\nThere at best and um I came to him and said look we we before we had you embedded there and but by the way I think I'm the only share up in the state that had ice in bed and we like that I listen I only give a crap about Pima County is where I live right I wanted this there this was an unusual step and what we found\nOut was that was under utilized they were not there very frequently anyway\nWe've looked at how many people actually had ice dictators in the jail so in other words what were we really tried to accomplish here and I got the numbers here I very seldom make notes but I did to do is three point two percent of the population of the jail have ice dictators\nThe vast majority of those people are there on serious felonies charges they're not going anywhere anytime soon they're either going to be in cars to read it in my jail for a long time or they're going to the department of corrections\nSo this hand off while convenient and I liked to have an ice there it was convenient and we have a great relationship with ice nothing about the way we exchange information with ice our collaboration with ice the\nWay that we hand off ice detainees knew either nothing about that has changed just the physical location because it was an impediment to these millions of dollars I Want to remove all the excuses other than politics because once you do that once you've removed yeah what are you going to happen to that point 'cause you keep\nAnd I got one more forty two real quick forty two and they want to get your reaction to the sheriff of ... listen to this year ago\nWhen Ramon ... first meeting you know they they came in and and with it now and when he came back without it yeah it it they were saying they're going to work and if you recall\nAnd that's what they do it's intended Asian and where am I going to come to it in in September it was pretty clear why would he bring it back after seven months of approval on because they're scared you know they're scaring it and that they're going to do a recall on him and this is how it works in Qena county\nAnd how he said that this happened right out in the open you were there they were there you heard them threaten him if you go with you approve this we're going to recall you so what makes you think you could ever play ball with these people\nWell first of all I think the threat of recalls absolutely bogus a remote can stand both on principle and on law well apparently he he doesn't think it's bogus because he changes go back to uh know and is is scared I think he needs to rethink that I Do I don't sense I'm Out in the community a lot a lot further than his district I talked to a lot of different people\nThere is not this groundswell of support\nAgainst stone garden there isn't the even the Democrats rationally understand that there are transnational crime threats coming up from our border\nThat the federal government has been unable to address don't garden money simply channels money to county sheriff's border shrubs to allow us to interject into that environment additional resources that the county tax payer doesn't have to pay for that is all this is about ... except for the far left leaning zealots type Democrats\nThe mainstream Democrats they get this Ramon has no danger of being recalled and I mean that with all my heart Ramon if you're listening I don't know if you are not you're not going to get recalled you're not going to get recalled for doing the right thing there'll be people who make a lot of noise about this and you'll be uncomfortable\nBut the end result is you are doing the right thing for the people whose county into the broader sense everybody knows that\nSupervisor Bronson this money goes directly to help benefit public safety of her constituents more than anybody else because of the way her district has done is I've been out in her district\nDon't see people coming from me going share we sure don't want you to get that stone guard money just the opposite they want our debt but he's out there but\nThey know here's the thing is that they don't care bike sharing and and Ramona supervisors\nAll they care about is hating Trump and if anything that they think could do something to benefit Trump there again they don't even listen to their own constituents\nThat aspect this has nothing to do with President Trump even a union they did with Obama when they approved it on the consent agenda this was not an Obama appropriate program when they\nWe've been on the consent agenda for a decade I Know I Know that's why I'm saying is that and you gave in\nAnd I see why you did you think it'll hopefully you know mentioned fences and say hey look I gave in now you give and this is what you want it I did it now no sign over the papers to give me the but they're they're never going to do we have more ... you'd hang with me if you don't mind um and if you did you want to take off people or they wouldn't let it is that All right no I don't I don't generally want to\nTake a lot of calls but if you have questions for the sheriff\nEight eight zero can FCAT zero five six seven eight or don't ruin it for

I mean the security the border is the federal government's responsibility we as they've advocated for decades under multiple administration that's why we have the problems that we have\nUm so we need to do something um to prevent this yeah and um security on the board I get I'm a grown tired because I've been in this valley for thirty one years and um for thirty one years we've talked about securing the border\nIf we took a little car ride there are places were still the borders absolute wide open range just nothing there um and that's the see the underpinning of stone guard ... going back to that but I Know what the federal government realized was that they had failed and their responsibilities secure the border\nAnd this was causing collateral public safety a detriment to counties especially to your one counties border counties or thirty one of the ...\nSo they're going to give federal funding to those border counties justice system and maintaining public safety and their counties and that includes overtime for more personnel deployment and then the money for equipment good thing right ... excellent and we have accepted that ground for twelve years until now\nAnd that's why I'm pushing so hard on this not only is it is about the millions right now you're at but it's millions calming\nThe continued escalation of these funds over the period of the next few years it's traditionally been about eighty five million this year it's a hundred and ten million and it's going to continue and increase in the voters I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican independent\nEveryone at Pima County should say you know what we want local law enforcement to have that money to keep us safer it just makes sense let me ask\nYou this man because you have this invasion happening and that's what this this is an invasion we don't know who these people are they're lying about asylum ended up there with their kids are they're not kid we we just don't know\nSo we shut down the border back in Nineteen eighty five\nWhen we had a da ... and it took Mexico ... about a few days to basically hand over the killer that that's that you know when we mean business everybody finally understand ... ... it's like why why don't we just mean business I Wish I Wish um that\nThat Trump would shut down the border because then ... crap we're gonna lose and a lot of money where you just it just needs to happen so anyway here's an Nielsen the homeland security has the power to ... ties local and state law enforcement\nIf you know we're we're ground zero whether it's Texas or it's they're coming right here at Arizona if ... Nielsen ... says a sheriff Napier I have to ... your your deputies we need their help to secure the border would you be okay with that\nWell the point is I don't have enough people I mean I have enough people to police Pima County I mean it's nine thousand two hundred square miles I have about roughly five hundred badge and gun type people\nUm so I don't have the resources to do that um that's the problem and that's what ... allows me to do is to deploy those resources with federal funding so I Need a supplemental funding to do anything substantive to the border\nMilitias emergency all of a sudden they're bum rushing election day in Fifteen days they get here we need your help to stop these people we need to arrest them and do whatever we need your up can you send a guy you guys down for a few days are you good within\nOh we would we do that all the time um we we always cooperate with our federal partners so this is not in ... and this was under prior administrators as well uh depicted as an adult I did it\nSo we always cooperate with our federal partners so I mean we have a strategic lines 'cause we have to there about four thousand border patrol agents in the ... or the Tucson sector we have a great relationship I have a fantastic relationship with chief parish ah you're not a beat regularly\nSo this is nothing really really new here I'm this massive influx coming up is something new and I think the federal government needs to take responsibility for that but\nClosing the borders is very complex I mean there are places outside of ... in our own county where the worst nothing it's very rural we need a wall there we need to to combine physical\nThat's one I mean he said let's let's look at people like people are fearful of the word physical barrier you want to say\nYou know is in wall is not a wall is just a bollards fence is it away because we know we need a wall plus we need drones plus we need sensors we need all the people want to hear wall because a wall cannot be taken away well what\nWe need is an impenetrable barrier and and there are places where that's going to be a wall but when we don't want to do in in border security is get caught up in the ... what is a wall\nThat that's a big deal to me it's counterproductive if that's the same as all like a chain link fence or a certain fence could be an impenetrable barrier technology could be an impenetrable barrier personnel could be in a dinner table barrier ... I don't but Garrett I'm less interested in how we do it then that we have got to do it\nBut here's the difference right we have Trump in there now see we get paid for the next one maybe the country and all these ships goes back and at the stroke of a pen\nYou get out of an Obama type person just decimate border patrol ice you name it and if there's no while they're not they're not going to sit back and go we're going to send wrecking ball to the border and destroy the wall once the wall is there it's not going away it's permanent it so that that ... that that's why people say we need the wall more than anything else\nThere are places because of topography and other factors we get it that if we're going to be really hard you know up in the mountains I get it but where it needs to be I mean it's it's something that's never going to be removed\nNobody's I don't think anybody's arguing against physical barriers walls whatever you want to call them where they make sense and there are places were positively they make sense in there there's a lot of good that they do ... we still got to shore up the ports of entry their major vulnerability a lot of people are coming through the ports of entry\nAnd just over stain but the other thing we got to look at is the larger scope of the drug epidemic I mean we're facing a National Public health crisis in the opiate addiction\nWe need to stop the flow of drugs into this country methamphetamine is on a trajectory that's very similar to opiates\nAnd this is I argue with my pure sheriff's all the time I talked to share back east and they said well sure if you don't understand you're always wanting that border money but we needed up here and I said well if you stop if I can stop it in my backyard people don't die on your front yard so\nUh by rejecting operations stoned garden funding supervisor Dick ally is sharing bronze Ramon Valdez making it much easier for math and opioids to get across the border\nThere absolutely and I know they don't like it when I say this but they're absolutely making Pima County last safety only argument that they could make against that is the one that I find to be offensive is that somehow the mission of public safety the plight of the undocumented is better served if the people in the county sheriff's department are not out\nThere they'd rather have beat people will be able to walk across the border they think it's something the poor people looking for a better life and let's just let that happen and you know drugs go through so be it\nThat's where their look if we enter decked and it sounds and consequential twelve ... no pills which of those twelve resulted in their overdose which of those ... was the tipping point to a lifelong addiction these are collateral costs that the people of the county\nSo then there is so there you go so can you then say that they have stopped you from being able to do your job I reject stoned garden money and if they're interfering through doing your job why can't you call some lawyer get them on your back and sue them over that\nBecause they don't back down they're not going to say fine will use taxpayer money for that there'll be outrage using taxpayer money to fight you for trying to secure the border well it will be a fight will be long and protracted all alone and then they'll throw them to call Monica ... come on or to the deal what I Want to\nDo is they have a legislative solution to this or a or a solution which they\nUnderstand that this money is fundamentally important to public safety in our county we're going to produce a in a few months here uh two thousand Nineteen grab request Sharon Bronson this is your district these are your people that were trying to keep safe from this isn't about politics is about keeping your people\nSay no but I'm telling you they're not gonna care man and and you know here's the thing you are you prepared to deal with the backlash when they reject the twenty nine teams don't garden funding again then\nWe go to another of the plant and with and that plan is suing them I I'm not going to schools that every chest move that I have in my head but I think that it becomes apparent the even the most ardent Democrat\nThat there is a person that is elected in this county to maintain public safety there is the chief law enforcement officer in this county that is me and if you don't like what I'm doing there's a solution and twenty twenty on elect me\nBut I'm doing my very best based on Thirty years of experience a master's degree living in this valley for more than Thirty Years' monitor standards of these things to keep us safe\nTrust the fact that I'm probably tied into this a little bit better than somebody on the board of supervisors is ... really quick really\nYeah and then one of the things that popped up on my radar screen I wanted to clear the air on 'cause uh I did a Facebook messages on this they're apparently something out there's a the cinema campus floating in saying that\nEither border sheriffs or or maybe even I have endorsed her that is not true I've never met her and and to her detriment as far as I'm concerned she's never reached out to border sheriff's\nNow really no she's never reach out to me I'm the largest border share up in the United states\nAnd she's never reached out to me to say sure you could I'd like to know more about border issues could we sit down and talk I Would have made time for very revealing um whereas a congressman Mick Sally gave me a big hug and prevent on friday and said she was happy to see me\nAh had dinner with her in Washington DC about three months ago uh she ... regularly meets with border sheriffs to try to better understand the environment down here so no ah we have not endorsed a cinema I don't know where that rumor came from but we need to put a stop to that they simply not\nTrue maybe it isn't as a big controversy the Arizona State troopers association came out and said we indoor cinema and we start getting messages that the troopers themselves like past because\nWe didn't vote on this yeah go on to a director ... in Phoenix on friday about that and he doesn't know where that came from either it's it's kind of out in left field sauce that's a big deal it's a big deal um it's a big ...\nAnd they ... him right sorry man that's what I Am not as though you're not appropriate amount all you know you're going to have me on more just for the entertainment value I Know that the valley of hanging out there but\nUm you know it's it's a problem and that's a very close race and it really shouldn't be I mean we're you know you look at the landscape down here I mean they've abandoned Leah Marquez Peterson yes I was that means anchor Patrick's gonna when we know we're not going to unseat ... CD three ... we're probably gonna lose CD one two oh Halloran\nAnd then we're right on the cost of turning cinema and mix Sally then you have ... coming up in a couple of years and he's essentially just a place holder and um we really need to think about Republicans about not eating our own so much\nTraining Trump Lincoln's is what they need they won't eat their own when they do a good job\nWhere we still in the you know if you do your candidate even though it's not a perfect candidate man I mean you talked to said they did is speak for the power of the people not be the chamber of commerce and it's a big difference when the candidates back Trump being ideas which is our ideas\nThey when when they don't I mean people are very distrustful of a mix Sally even though you need to vote for her every distrust of all because of everything she's done it or pass and all of a sudden she's going to one eighty\nAnd won't talk about it so yeah but you know the Dems don't do the same thing and that's that's why they're affordable for us because they don't go after their own uh in the primaries and then what happens in the primaries Republican gets\nKilled in the primary you know so you come out of the primary your battled and then you have a little you know from that that's the establishment because they've just shut people down her throat twenty four seven and we've had enough and they keep doing it so I mean I Can't blame him for that and you know the Democrats went through with Hillary and Bernie and with our social if they're trying to throw socialist the Democratic party saying\nWhat the hell what are we going to be either a weird laws either way I ... you're not and you know the best way to unseat\nWere although you move the liquor bottle a bit further away anyway or does it wait you couldn't go there so a really quick you also have meetings\nGoing on yeah we've got a couple of things coming up that are important one is that on November seventh um\nApparently attorney general sessions went to a department of justice the cops office in the apartment homeland security and said I Need to you guys to go to the border ask border sheriff's what they need and make sure that they get it\nUh the executive director of national sheriffs association called once you're up in the United states and I was honored that that was me ah because you understand so I've been plugged into these border issues for quite some time now so we'll be hosted a meeting here in Tucson on November seventh the border serves\nA federal authorities and this is another place we make the case for look I'm having problems with stone guard money that I should not be having\nThe should not be a political issue how can Washington DC help border share of because it doesn't do any good if you're going to send money my way that I Can't take right and so we need to find a solution that I'm the chief of the border patrol national chief a border patrol Carlo provost will be ... next month I'll be out there with her again to make the case where how do we fix this\nUm because sheriffs have an affirmative responsibility for public safety in their respective counties the Susan politics politics and public safety should never intercept each other\nSo speaking of that really quick jerk then we got to go you looking for a state fix or federal fix where all of a sudden maybe you can get the grants and not have to deal with the board of ... so\nI take either one because we need to remove politics from this equation\nI'm interested with public safety in this county I if I come forward and said this grant is fundamental to public safety in our county I should be able to undermine authority as elected official constitutional statutory authority the accepted grad and if the people of the county think I'm doing wrong there is a solution to that they voted out the vote\nYeah that's the thing we we didn't elect ... to be the sheriff we elected you have more if you don't work for them right for us I work\nFor all of you and I personally prepared my entire life for this job man I started as a cop and Ninety Nineteen eighty one I've done the things I Need to do to prepare you to be your share of\nAnd I'll tell you of all the honors in my life and I get choked up when I even think about this is the honor of being this year for this county I started as a poor little skinny kid in Iowa with not two dimes to rub together as a young police officer and I I didn't have anything I could not imagine life's journey and I I Do take that for granted any day I wake up\nI'm honored to serve this county's your share of ... we may not always agree I get that I understand that sometimes I'll do things you go what in the hills that do thinking\nWell just know that in my heart I'm always thinking about uh some always thinking about what I Believe to be right for public safety that small when he'd be on your show over an hour and a half\nThe good what your great that your number one thing is the Democrat into the ground and Barry Barry\nThat know my my I have to do the best show I can possibly do build let me ask you a question what do you do for a living\nI'd rather not say\nOh okay you sure you're going to bail you don't want to go to your job and just talk about how bad Democrats are all day\nI I'm trying to be so I I think that you I'm just trying to we're on the same we're on\nThat I Know we are but they don't give me this thing that I Can't make a comment about Martha make Sally 'cause it's gonna make you feel if Martha my family doesn't get elected that's Martha ... fault not mine simple as that you know I never I never\nSaid that either so we're in agreement on that bill I Love your buddy I listen I get

President Trump really we took our kid out early we get up there we found a great parking spot right at the end of the line when he ran\nTwo of our kids had either a boat or a sprained ankle on their feet but we still can grab their white in line and tell you we waited probably I don't know three and a half four hours a moving just\nLike snails pace and then we all started moving really quickly and we were excited people around us people wearing flags people wearing crop hats Trump close\nThe camaraderie and they know but he was allowed nobody was really nobody was pushing and shoving we finally got to where we thought we were going to get to go in well of course our before that they'd already felt the hanger which only\nSeen it quite Eighteen hundred people that the rest of the twenty thousand others stand outside\nOh and they had set up a big screen TV but there were men out there there is no way for us\nSo much people tried to hold chip on their phones so\nOverall we hear bits and pieces of it\nThe cool thing was when he came up before he landed when he came in on Murray and went around they took him around so he can see the crowd so he knew exactly the type of crowd that live there but even twenty thousand others couldn't get in\nEverybody was happy to be there when it when\nIt was just great and and when you left a little bit early just because we were tired standing and we\nCouldn't really hear and but\nThey didn't win and had last year when Trump came in September we went up to see him and in Phoenix um and it was great we actually did get to go in and see him and that's how I feel like the crowds are getting bigger and bigger and bigger so I Can't wait to see the rally tonight I Can't wait to see\nThat and I'm joined that's why it just feels like something's going on doesn't it I mean all these all of a sudden you have these stories coming out a Washington Post I mentioned is the beginning of the show you're probably sleeping House Democrats

coming out of that on Saturday and a hundred thousand people aren't tickets to the end today\nOver ... yeah it's it's it's great thing about it [noise] people can't stand the media now more than they

and against shame a local media for not doing any stories about this and not quarter accused in cinema\n\nWhich she said was yeah I'm okay with Americans going to join the Taliban to fight and kill Americans I don't care how could you not care about that\n\nSo you have that now are really quick this story from the daily mail I was like wow here's a headline\nPlane mutiny kept a gang raped gang

she's a ... a year since and mushy really is a third thing I think you need to know the Trump stir fry runoff warning shots as he showed\nA sticking it again he did it last night to Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala\nYou said we're informed the countries of Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador below their citizens or others to Journey Through their borders and up to the U.S with the intention of entering our country illegally all payments made to them will stop\nFrenzies end exclamation point that's\nBeen done and then he also follow that up anybody entering the United states illegally will be arrested and detained prior to being sent back to their country\nAnd apparently Mexico is valid to stop this caravan that's what they're saying we'll get to that three things I think you need to know yesterday\nA Pima County supervisors meeting these people are crazy we have so many issues and problems that really need to be solved\nBut led by supervisor Dick ally is sharing the driver Bronson and Ramona valid as Roosevelt is they voted to say uh apparently even though Trump took us out of the Paris climate agreement\nWe are going to abide by that Pima County are you kidding me what does that mean we're to talk to Pima County supervisor alley Miller about his alley good morning how you doing\nI'm doing great how are you All right so so this has been going on for a while right take us back ah when Trump pulled us out of the Paris climate agreement I Know that had to wear exploding\nYes uh back in two thousand Seventeen died when Trump rescinded the climate agreement\nA Pima County a board of supervisors in June of two thousand Seventeen they passed a resolution that they were going to support that climate change resolution and now they've come up with an a a sustainable action plan to meet that climate change\nAnd one of the requirements is there is to reduce your carbon emissions down below that two thousand five level by twenty six to twenty eight percent\nSo that's one at the uh goals set the Pima County sustainable action plan [laughter] excuse me which was passed yesterday and ah which means we have to reduce our projected twenty twenty five\nAh emissions I a fifty percent\nI twenty twenty five and eight you know and the next seven years and you start looking at this and that plan and it's a very detailed plan that covers carbon water landscapes and material that we use\nAnd some of it is common sense things that anybody would be doing like recycling reuse fusing reclaim water those kinds of things makes sense to me but then when you start talking about\nAll of these you know lead silver LEED certified buildings you got to look at the trade off with a ...\nAnd I did ask Huckleberry a couple of questions yesterday one of the things they want to do it by ... open space okay and we are already young almost eighty four thousand acres of opens\nA window unit and by who owns that land right now is it it just people just the federal government the state of Arizona where they buying it's owned\nBy Pima County and that's dedicated in perpetuity can be preserved is natural open space and so they want to get more open space and as you know it's like between twelve and fourteen percent of the land and Pima County is on the tax role so they want to take even more land up the tab\nYou're going to say so they want to take that who who owns that land right now in the county\nWell this land is owned by Pima County because over the years a Pima County has bought up all of this open space land and we'll be dedicated to get this that section pen her met a guy from the federal government\nSo were they were they buying it for like they're buying it from themselves\nOh yeah he's a county than buying this land and and it was you know the tax payers devoted to buy all of this open space and so it's like a you know we thought a lot of ranch is weak back you open space in general\nAnd what was the point of that was it to make sure that nobody would buy it and like the old on it or they don't think\nIt's part of the ... desert conservation plan guy which show was it proved to years ago and people want it to preserve that Lance people want a more open space here which has happened\nBut you know you start looking at it and you go why are we going to be buying more open space and you know wildlife court or linkages and that kinda thing and\nI don't know if you're aware of it already up in ... valley you know they built the wildlife bridge\nOh yeah and the residents\nAre pretty much all up in arms because apparently they're having problems getting the animals to use the bridge\nOr even heard that\nIt's up around residential areas that are kind of ugly I guess and the residents are very upset about that they don't want 'em around their yards or you know looking out the window and looking at these ugly fences which are rallying the animals trying to force\nThat bridge so it's those kinds of things and uh you know I just looked at it and I said this is going to cost a fortune yeah they're they're having all kinds of managers are heading outreach programs education programs\nUh all of these things that are going to cost a lot of money at electric cars\nA silver LEED certified buildings\nAnd so I'm sitting there thinking yesterday I'm going okay electric cars why don't we start with let's buy a whole lot less of these cars there were three supervisors\nThat have a county car there are a lot of managers down there that don't need it county car I had one when I first got elected and I realize this is a way we don't need these cars we don't need to be paying for cars we don't need to be\nHaving a county supervisors managers county attorney than they thought that ... county ... only ...\nYou know here's the thing they do because you don't have a car my I have to drive to work every day yeah why why do I you know so you do the public's were go get a job in the private sector then yeah I mean\nYeah there's things like you know the sheriff's department vehicles and you know a vehicles\nThat need to be used for waste water that kind of thing that we do need but I think we could cut out probably forty to fifty percent of these vehicles\nWill let me ask you this to about ... supervisor ... game seven Ninety eight years he revise or do you I mean do you put on a ridiculous amount of miles is it unfair if you don't have a car\nNo because you can turn in your mileage and get reimbursed for it they have you know so I drive my car I don't turn in mileage 'cause it's just easier for me to just drive\nAnd it it's more hassle for me to do their work but driving around the district I mean if I have to go to a meeting and on the way back oh stop at the grocery store you know that kind of close to where I Would have gone anyway\nSo I don't bother a very seldom do I turn in my life to report\nThe Sharon Bronson epic Oregon\nYes she does um I was surprised I thought she I didn't realize that she did that yeah we just got a report on the county cars they haven't been through it a completely to get the total number\nShould yeah go through and I'm kind of drivers course after she wrecked won by driving into a wall of [laughter] I mean I usually when I hear your ear to take a course here in our media every year we've done nothing wrong with the girl that I have to take all these different courses\nAbout rules and blah blah blah blah you know she literally destroyed a county car by driving into a wall of water yeah you know shouldn't watch a video or be told by someone as you should sign documents that have happened\nBut I I Do know they have a program if you're going to be driving a county vehicle you are supposed to take a course\nAnd I think it's a one at one hour course or something at the online thing oh yeah they are but\nYou know one of the things they're talking about is you know we've got to have less carbon in the air well I got a plan for your check how about fixing the roads how about widening thorny delta four lanes like should have been it's been on a plant since the mid nineties\nHow about doing that instead of having these traffic back that these are things we can do without implementing this whole plan that will actually have an impact at some colder\nWhere these roads get blocked off every time we have a rainstorm and the other issue we have with that is we have this heavy equipment\nGreat big old those are I Know a lot where I live there out here for days after every rainstorm pumping carbon into the air is they're cleaning up the dirt that crosses that were out there's there's like truckloads of Sam that they have to clean up every time those are just\nYou know kind of minor things that they could do that would have an impact a you know and and going to all electric vehicles as you know a hybrid and electric they're already has been moving in that direction well they don't pay gas tax\nSo we've got to make sure the legislature passes something to start charging these electric cars and these hybrid cars at the for driving on the roads because they're not paying for um\nWell you know that by the way I mean I I I'll send you this do you should probably and and I'm sure to have no impact because they are going to vote the way they're going to vote and Germans three two yeah but there was a study from Bloomberg new energy financing barrels strategy out of ... advisors\nOr the another study questions electric vehicles are good for the environment because apparently the manufacturing of the lithium ion batteries that power it it takes a so much energy or it actually there's so much carbon dioxide produced\nThat does anything by the way to the environment but there's so much carbon dioxide emitted into the production of these batteries that it it it's actually worse to ... I had heard about that and also\nSo that people aren't driving extra mile their vehicles are sitting there idling\nBut you know these kinds of things they don't really care about they want to work with the EU as a research projects they want to build silver LEED certified buildings\nAll of this costs money and when you look through it the plan is on line he has it up there there's all kinds of implementation programs outreach programs\nEducation programs up just to develop the plan and they had at least Fifteen department managers and their staff attending\nFifty meeting oh my God yeah that's the hours and hours of employee time that it costs money none of this is for free yeah and you know we've got all of these other pressing issues they really you know there are number one priority is fixing the road no you got to pay an extra tax to fix the ...\nAnd that's the thing it prompted a profit for sixty three where they want to raise taxes again just fix the roads yet\nThey want to fix the roads little creature taxes for that but meanwhile we've got all this money to burn yeah on\nOn these kinds of initiatives and it's common sense folks we don't need to create these color binders and have all these meetings it's common sense\nThings that we need to be doing that we could be doing within these departments right now without having to spend a whole lot of money and trying to uh you know meet the Paris accords yeah\nThat's that's if we try to if we truly tried to get there it's going to cost us a fortune and um you know and and that impacts\nThe taxes and it also impacts any businesses coming in here we already have three times the tax rate of Maricopa County\nAnd we have to subsidize businesses we have to build them buildings worldview for example Seventeen million we at that built caterpillar eight fifty million dollar ... a re a new way though did that Pima County gave them face to stay and until they get that building built at four to five million costs\nPeople think that we can continue to do this to pay companies to come here uh we can't afford to do this and eventually they will run out of taxpayer money because people are getting really sick of getting nothing for their taxes\nAnd this is just another step in my opinion\nIn the wrong wrong direction because they're focusing on things that are are going to cost money and add to our already overburdened taxpayers rather than look at the common sense things and they keep saying the roads are the number one priority but if you come to the board meetings you'll see every week it is not\nTo do anything but the roads and real quick they so they want to build new buildings county buildings as silver lead and I think\nWe are so many empty buildings as it is what why do we need to keep building more county officers and buildings we have enough of them\nYeah meanwhile they buy a bowling alley that's full of asbestos than in Brighton heights and we're going to remodel that that makes sense and no four to five million remodeling it uh it it they do not walk the walk you know they they come in and say you know we're doing all of this to appease the environmentalists\nAnd then they're off doing all these other crazy things and uh you know ... or ... acquiring golf courses that we don't need yup uh and and that's going to cost us you know it's at least a hundred thousand a year just to maintain that plus we\nHave ... you know it it it never ends and do you start looking at\nThis and it's very frustrating to sit there and watch them make a big deal out of this when in fact the United states is the number one\nCountry and reducing carbon emissions and all we have to do is follow Trump fleet yup and do the right things and and let the market work and and just look at comments that no one is against recycling\nProtecting the environment everyone wants to do that and and just make sure you're doing the right thing since ... out this really expensive and shit us\nAren't real quick I get twenty seconds because people are going to say what can we do I got a mad and you got above the right way but he is there anything else is there is there there's really no way to reach these people as there\nUm you know I I I always ask people contact your supervisors not just me contact them let them know what you're feeling and I think you know and twenty twenty five supervisors are up for election and people need to um\nPay attention we had hoped last election and twenty sixteen that we would get a change on that board it did not happen yeah and that's the sad thing\nIs that people don't pay enough attention to what's going on here locally and your property taxes are a big part of your bills every month and so you know I guess how people are really awake and paying attention to what's going on\nI did have a gentleman come up to me yesterday going I Can't believe what's going on here I have no idea what the man was\nThat he was sitting back he walked up to me he was in shock at what he was witnessing when I ask them questions like how much did the sacred cost us oh you'll have to add up the numbers from all the bond election how much where that data for fourteen million you say we say you can calculate that\nThey don't even give it to you know no no no uh Huckleberry refuses to give them the information whenever I ask for it done he teases me interfering with county employees and that it's too expensive to get the information this is what's going on with your government\nAnd by the way is Steve really quick I'm going to talk to you Steve Christie backing you up and saying we're just information as you do just sit there and just be quiet\nNow he doesn't he doesn't ask where the man what a disappointment African guy as well have you know some guy he's still on what he thinks he needs to do a and ... cronyism soul there yeah I'm I'm pretty disappointed might have like an alibi horrible yeah um so what\nWhat we're doing is trying to do the best we can to get people educated and I am absolutely against that prop for sixty trade because why get a new tax when we have money to burn on these kinds of\nThings and and I hope people I think people everyone I talked to they're sick of being taxed and um you know people are telling me they're voting now ...\n... and I hope they should they and they should and I was I'm just

you need to know so it all of this caravan stuff going on\nI mean we need to talk the expert the best of the best uh and that is\nDirector of policy studies at the center for Immigration Studies Jessica Vaughan Jessica thank you so much for the time today how you doing\nGood to talk with you well same here let's start before the Caribbean a European email you were in Phoenix and you actually experienced rain would shock to you you were not expecting that a lot of ... when it when it rains it pours year when it doesn't rain often so I knew you send me a pictures and these are just unbelievable\nYou were in Phoenix you had meetings and then you went to the greyhound bus station in Phoenix\nRight well that's where I was told that uh all of the hundreds of cases that are starting to show up in the Arizona border factors were being dropped off now by on the border patrol\nAnd sometimes I ah because there are so many people coming now through Arizona that they have nowhere to put them and they are forced to get\nThem they were taking them to the bus station dozens and dozens at a time and most of them are not staying in Arizona they're headed toward town near me I mean ... ... and ...\nIt's it's a pretty interesting site um it's it's very alarming that first of all that it's happening in Arizona now because almost all of it this was going on in South Texas before\nUh and now they there there must be a new smuggling operation that's opened up with a new deal with a different cartel or to get over the Arizona border but that's what they're doing and of course\nYou know they just need to say that\nThey need to bring a child and say that they have a fear of return and our uh our policy right now to just release them into the country drop 'em off at the bus station the humanitarian groups that monitor these things were complaining that they were being dumped at the station without um you know\nFood and water and now us taxpayers are giving them plastic bags full with a with a box lunch and a bottle of water\nAnd you know you can see them with their on below you know with the department of homeland security feel on them that says that's that's their permission to be here now and they're off a two communities all over the country and um\nWe probably will not see them show up according to ice only about a third of them will cut off the ankle bracelets that they are given to monitor their whereabouts you know from the get go\nMost of them don't file an asylum application and those that do half of them don't show up for their immigration court hearing so this is basically um you know kind of illegal immigration and illegal settlement happening right in plain sight\nUm with with no resistance from the government it's our policies that are anti seen them here and that's when you know of course a wall would help too\nI was gonna say what a wall I mean it'd be just wrote up to a wall they couldn't do anything right it is with nicely\nThey they'd have to go to another place to cry that that might be more difficult and maybe they would you know realize that that's too dangerous to do a and but it it's right now out of control\nAnd uh now of course we have this caravan coming up from Central America forward\nAnd before that real quick and this is just going to you're listening to she's with the center for Immigration Studies a C I F dot org or is the website 'cause people listening right now you know they're saying what does the Trump do something about this is there any I mean because we've been reading stories last two or three weeks again like you said people are charging the border\nAnd you're taking advantage of the system and we're being overrun we don't have the facilities to hold them so we're just releasing them so is there anything that actually can be done in anything can Trump do anything I think there are\nThings that can be done I give the administration credit for doing the attorney general Jeff Sessions has has um\nHold a vote to adjudicate asylum applications that they need to get back to what the law says and that means only people who are actually being persecuted by the government in their home country which is not the case with most of these people and they you know they're working with\nThe courts to try to overturn\nSome of these ah frankly irrational decisions that have been made by nine thirty nine one nine circuit judge 'em that limits how long they can detain people who come with a child\nBut they have to do more CBP needs to step up and actually start taking some responsibility for these cases instead of just dumping them on ice and into the immigration courts that's not enough food\nCan they do I mean can you can you hold on can they hold them and they turn around and make them go back with what can be done\nI think they should try the best thing is that they do not make it\nInto the country at all to the border at all and the president is putting pressure on Central American countries that didn't seem to work too much and also Mexico now I did read this morning that one of the organizers of this caravan that's coming has now been arrested\nYes in Guatemala Honduras horn on and on your it you'll get\nYou know we don't read too much about deportation from Guatemala but it happened apparently and Mexico doesn't have to let them in Mexico under Mexican immigration law if they enforce it they people have to have a transit visa\nAnd so they don't have to issue them transit visas if they don't qualify under Mexican law which apparently they do not but again you know\nHow susceptible are Mexican immigration officials to look the other way for some of these people we we don't really know but now that at least there's a lot of attention\nOn Mexico to see what they're going to do and they're going to be implications for our relationship with Mexico if they are not seen as a good neighbor so I'm happy to see the Trump Administration actually saying\nYou know we're ... we're not happy with this or something you can do about it we're going to hold you accountable for it in other ways one I don't have finally has to\nDo crazy things that you have this on during the former Honduran lawmaker obviously a nut arrested in Guatemala\nBringing these people over it's obviously Guatemala and Honduras want

do you still not get it and it's okay but all explain it again some people are upset I don't think that was good it was just low was this if he didn't call her story or if you didn't call her horse face\nThe media would not have said anything about Stormy Daniels and the fact that her joke of a lawsuit was so bad that the judge said I'm dismissing it and it's so ridiculous beyond the pale that storm you're paying his legal fees you're paying Trump's legal fees if Trump didn't ... just like when Trump if he didn't say\nIn the Trump way what he said about Christine for all the holes in her story wasn't mocking you're just saying with humor what a what exactly she said\nI don't know what had happened where it happened how I got there how I left it if I had a beer these details the media didn't cover of Trump didn't mention that it never would have been known never ever ever would have been known whatsoever right so the reason that Trump called her ... a stormy horse face\nIs because the media wasn't going to what they don't want people to know that her lawsuit was so pathetic the judge threw it out\nSaid you have to also pay Trump's legal fees that's why he does this stuff to make the media coverage\n\nYou don't do just to be outrageous oh and by the way I saw some adult on shockingly MSNBC say oh what he is doing his is beneath the dignity of the oval office\nI'm so sick

this to this is great it doesn't say it doesn't get covered just the way it is they hit again the market drop last week Thirteen hundred points lead story\nEverywhere 'cause the the media when people start to think Trump's in eighty so close to them it terms I shouldn't electric to me the market's gonna crash he's killing everything is as bad as\nTwo days you know a correction is ten percent drop like two percent two or three a market goes up five hundred forty seven points yesterday no one mention of it on the network newscasts so they lead and pounded into the sand that the market drop Thirteen hundred points for two days last week\nGoes up five and a forty seven points yesterday not a peep not a peep zero that's\nDrudge fell for this and I I'm like really click bait is this what it is the Associated Press did a forty minute interview with Trump in the oval office\nHere's the headline from the Associated Press Trump tells a piece of sea to press he won't accept blame of GOP lose his house and you look at that and say what's\nAnd first off when I saw the headline I'm like well first off you can't blame the guy I mean he's saying run on these things and you have some some members of Congress that are refusing to do it they don't have the guts that Trump has\nBut then you actually read the story you don't do it for what Russia has which is drive by and read you read the story facing the prospect of bruising electoral defeat in ... elections really President Trump said Tuesday\nRyan was alerted through a friend that was the state troopers association the Arizona State troopers association that's right like their union or they came out and endorsed Houston cinema\nAnd apparently there is a crap load of backlash a crap load of backlash\nUm we're now being told by people that there wasn't even a vote these were the were the other thing that you have I don't get the action the corner and it'll bring up yeah OK the original thing I'm okay this is what we're being told now are there is a major demand for resignations because the executive board\nDid this without any vote\nThey didn't ask what the actual union members wanted with the troopers wanted they just did it themselves now there's a major demand for resignations um and apparently they use to back in the day\nAdvocate for pro law enforcement positions not\nCandidates because they were five oh one C. three so everything is political nowadays\nEverything it's oh so that that's just the latest there just\nWhat it is these people think they are they can get away with this stuff I mean what what are they thinking\nThat's the problem is that they're not think at all so that's that's the latest uh when it comes to that whole situation\nAnd you know we didn't take I think only took one call we rented a time or the interviews ... dot com and on my page uh yeah I can see that coming our radio dot com of what we had with Jessica Vaughan and Allie Miller in the alley Miller interview was really incredible and the fact that she said\nThey are ... they they voted yesterday at the same kind of go to supervisors to have us abide by the Paris climate agreement\nInstead of actually widening certain roads and fixing the roads so cars aren't stuck in traffic idling and of course the emissions happening or they just want you to stop driving overall and they want to take money ... he wants to take money and buy more open space open land\nAnd they want to build really expensive environmentally friendly buildings we already have in the buildings they bought a freaking bowling alley what\nThe hell are they doing and you know Steve Christie just sat there and shut up apparently what a disappointment Steve Christie is supervised Christie what a joke\nAnd again you know we'll play some highlights coming back because\nI only Miller's asking will you claim as the saving money of any evidence of this any this and that nothing there is zero zip zilch nothing so we have that and we'll also get to the uh the caravan of migrants\nBecause that's another crazy story in of itself\nNow I mean you care about your money we talk about the money to wasteful spending at Pima County and things like that and what about your money okay what about your money or do you have investments you have a financial broker an individual person who who\nIs in charge of that how much are you paying them brokers get paid commissions this is what is very important brokers get paid commissions\nKnow that against them it just seems a bit outdated does it do they get paid commissions\nAre and what does that mean that means there are more motivated to sell you something that's gonna make them more money than look out for your best interests and that's where ... where he's coming okay ... our financial professionals that are legally bound to put your best interests first they have to do it or they could be sued\nThat's a big deal right doing without putting your best interest first not their own a commission first true aging wealth right here in Tucson or at ... swan [noise] do you know what they do they don't charge commission they are their feet\nThey get paid to manage your

was told that\nYou can win politically that may maybe that was it I don't know but it's ... he tried he tried um but you got to separate the families apparently when the families were separated viewed

now's the time to go they're not going to separate your stop you you just say you need asylum in your family the letter writing and it's exactly what's happening thank you wish Republicans and

teams what he said\nWhat if you're not French I think it would still hurt so yeah so yeah we'll we'll get to all those stories it's\nIt's insane but first we got to get to a mix Sally and send them to get to the president possibly closing the southern border and and how how awesome that he's actually threatening this and he should do it if that's what it comes down to\nUm now I Want you to hear though a mix Sally and cinema\nThey were sitting next to each other it looked kind of awkward isn't in the video that I ... didn't look a little strange yeah sure did I'm\nLike there's the cafeteria table sitting next to each other or in front of the Arizona Republic editorial board where once again I mean you have not by the way I view you told me if I'm wrong I have not seen one damn story in the local paper on the local TV stations\nNow on the Web sites for them now one story about here since that I'm as radical past\nNobody has questioned him and by the way maybe that's one of the reasons why even Bram Resnick of NBC twelve up in Phoenix what a news twelve in Phoenix I said that I Can't even get any time with with the cinema she runs from this stuff and what she's doing she's not anything like that like she was when I knew or Fifteen Years ago\nShe was a radical nut and she really is this is a whole big lie up Assad will gave you must have somebody will get to know stick it on my page ... dot com however\nOr even the Arizona Republic editorial board wasn't asking the right questions it is relevant about her mocking Arizona's hating Arizona calling us extremists telling other states not to be like us are calling a American Soldiers terrorists\nThese are big things big thing nothing nothing\nSo I Want you to hear this first they actually did ask though about the Taliban comments\nThere is the first thing I Want you to hear a from here in cinema okay ah this is a her ... answer to the Taliban comments and say what what do you what about the Taliban comments this is such gobbledygook is is Obama ask BS Obama asked time filler listen to this year we go [laughter]\nUnderstanding that context Iraq [laughter] conversation a car and I don't know if it had an opportunity [laughter]\n... [laughter] very interesting how it went very [laughter] I really liked about what I Want to talk about not comment on track offhand what [noise]\nWhat I'd like to try and I have to show what what I was part of our hair and when I [noise]\nI ... [laughter] she's ... [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] ... [noise] I [noise] I was\nSo she says every time she is creepy mandate is creepy to hear this creepy\nYeah [noise] so there's that that's one\nYou want to hear the context of it by the way this is what the two thousand three radio interview sounded like here we go\nBuy more he has an individual if I Want to go fight in the Taliban army I go over there now you know I'm I'm fighting for the Taliban that I'm Sorry that's personal decision and I asked I Want to I'm Wondering if\n[noise] yep and mix Sally by the way put out a thing on our website or a tweeter whatever about uh the definition of\nTreason and basically what it means in encouraging people to fight our own country and kill our own people just exactly what she was doing I don't care if you go fight you know joined the Taliban to fight American I don't care when he joined the Taliban your goal is to kill Americans that's what it comes down to and she said\nYou hear about that she was fine with it it's a big freaking deal why do you notice or an answer was different set of his answer was different I was trying to get something back on track was hard to have a conversation it was an offhand comment on what she said when she was asked about the debate you want to know why 'cause they had a reef fine her answer 'cause she's all crafted phoney and fake\nWhen it comes down to very crafted very phoney very very fake um let's bring up this was toward the end is one of the videos is toward the end of your number twenty five\nMartha McSally at least more than make Sally or got tough and\nShe called accused in cinema for going after American members of the military and of course here since ... played it up my brother served and he served ... if you'd probably if you care too much for your brother why would you actually put out a flyer\nSaying American military members are causing terror in the middle east you think your brother's a terrorist she's not man okay listen to the mix failure ago\nYou know when you were handing out a flyers in these multiple protests that you had at the time ... and one of them were you were to leave like you were many times you pick that our troops as skeletons and said stop the U.S terror and the middle east again this is another CNN story that was broken\nAbout this uh and so when you talk about can you you know\nCan you separate protesting the Atari accent from denigrating are too\nIn that case they were one in the same the flyer for her protest I don't remember if that was the thing to do one or not or whether they're picking our troops skeletons and saying we were the terrorists like I I'm not making any of this up and I think it's really important\nFor the voters to know the full history of both of our lives and and what we have done in our lives what we have led on what we put our passion into and these many years cast and uh that you were out of the mainstream uh protesting advocating the SAT down and look this entire pattern or over many many\nMany years at least she called her out for that I don't want to people will be I mean I Know other people at the Arizona Republic didn't want to ask about it because they don't want to make Sally to when I even have in the ...\nA a columnist who's on the editorial board for the Arizona Republic tearing into\nMore than make Sally her name is Olivia de ... on the bottom of this it says that that's why I notice she's an editorial columnist for the Arizona Republic or peace is Martha McSally think Arizona voters are stupid you bet she does and I'm like\nWhy\nHow 'bout does cinema think Arizona voters are stupid she mocked the hell out of us made fun of us was ashamed of us for years we played the soundbites how to turn this around\nWell this lady right there was a reason Republican Martha McSally accuse her democratic rival of trees and against the u._s. in one second of a sixty minute debate excel a grim national headlines are desperate quest to when you ascendancy from Arizona\nMix alleys reason she's counting us the Arizona voters to be stupid enough to believe her unsubstantiated accusation against one of the most moderate politicians in the states recent history wow and then she writes Martha McSally has come on ... this is what's in the Arizona Republic\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest Martha fan but this is crazy this is crazy one of the most moderates she's anything but moderate you figure\nThat well she voted a you know only sixty sixty percent with Trump and you know and really that's what you're going with she devise real Democratic Party to vote with Trump sixty percent of the time why wouldn't Arizona's one senator who can be disciplined and thoughtful with our messaging\nYou choose creepy\nMatter of fact really quick let's play brand Resnick again on MSNBC twenty six brand Resnick political reporter for the Phoenix NBC affiliate invited on MSNBC to talk about cinema and make Sally and Chuck Todd distorted and listen to what Resnick said here we go\nOne thing that's also come through and talking with voters even ones that I think have already decided who they're gonna vote for\nWake up in Canada they may vote for they don't feel like they know either candidate\nA no they don't look at here since ... right now this appears in cinema circa twenty a chain of running against here's some cinema two thousand two to twenty ... when I got three and ... a cinema Congress only cinema it's not really put herself out there for people like me reporters we maybe four minute verse\nWhich is\nIf lifetime could actually make a candidate to run for Senate it'd be care since then\nI could see the movie doubt\nStarring Tori Spelling and every other I Know to cast off\nOkay were popular in their day exactly and now they

base not a Republican base about thirty to thirty three percent when you have another group that didn't like his persona but like the policies of about twelve percent they really love this stuff\nI Love is the small segment of lukewarm Trump supporters appear to have locked in its preference after Trump and congressional Republicans pass a tax cut bill all this stuff uh\nThe earlier study found only thirty seven percent a female voters approved of Trump's job performance that was conducted as the White House sought to fend off the controversies running\nKavanaugh which was known that was the dams and Christine Ford most recent poll found forty three percent of women surveyed approved of Trump how 'bout that he grew no kidding no kidding\n\nYeah while his standing among female voters

Gallup first started tracking this in Nineteen forty five Gerald Ford's approval rating Ninety weeks into was accidental presidents he was Seventy one percent\nBut the press lost interest in comparison to win as time went by remember who's forty five percent when he took office forty four percent now\nForty four percent by the way Trump's approval rating is now a higher than ready for this or tied with three of the past six presidents at this point in their first terms he's currently tied with Obama forty four percent say the same approval you'd never believe that right\nNow the media coverage he's above Bill Clinton who at forty one percent at this rate and Ronald Reagan what forty to Obama's approval rating on day one was sixty seven percent but declined\nFrom five to six

into that stuff okay we'll get into that stuff or second thing that I think you need to know is that the Arizona troopers association has withdrawn their support\nOf cures dean cinema\nBecause it was just some random people on top and everybody else the members were mad is really the Arizona State trooper who in ... and every senator or the United states so they withdrew their uh their support\n'em\nAnd and they're not supporting Martha but I pretty much if all of a sudden you like\nIt comes out no we do not support this candidate I'm pretty sure that means wink wink we support the other one that's\nJust me but again uh what what do I know what do I know right uh so we have that a third thing that I think you need to know there was this big story in the New York times\nThat Chinese and Russian Spies are listening to President Trump cell phone conversations\nThis whole big thing uh they don't have any actual named people that actually can say this of course in the New York times\nOr however the president did tweet that this is yes fake news that he doesn't actually use a personal cell phone use is nothing but government phones and very rarely you has one but he doesn't really use it a an actual governments are issued cell phone\nDo they just don't stop they literally just don't stop\nHe tweeted the so called experts on Trump over the New York times or along and boring article on my cell phone usage that is so incorrect they didn't have time here to correct it I only use government phones and I've only seldom used government cell phone story is so wrong\n\nYep all they do is attack attack attack attack attack anything they can and whether freaking out oh my God it in ... by the way in the store they actually said that Trump left his cell personal cell phone on a golf cart role playing golf leaving Secret Service to scramble to get it aides have told him really\nDidn't really Rocco Bob ... was made ... ... yeah yes they you eat it you know that was okay though he's like I'm not giving up my blackberry don't happen to know\nAnd didn't Hillary Clinton refused to give back in ... computer smashed into little bits for someone not godly reason that's a good point that's a good point but in the garbage disposal\nYou do three things I think you need to know by the way a couple of hours ago Trump tweeted out to our buddy Brandon Judd for as the United states we tell brand enjoyed is bald\nI'm just [laughter] I treat out Brandon Jake only gives his all of his friends and his brother they'll listen what I'm told guys what's on sale this\nBrand and I appreciate it brand and joined the national border patrol council he was on Fox and friends this morning rented ... of the national border patrol council was right when he says\nFox and friends of the Democrats inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border must be changed of course he spelled it incorrectly as well get ripped for it you must be ... C. H. A. N. D. V. D. and said gee end of the world must be changed but I'm bringing out the military\nFor this national emergency there'll be some so he says he's bringing up the military\nWe'll see you know no actual coverage of the of the Caribbean and the last you know almost twenty four hours right nothing nothing nothing\nThat I Know of ... are you texting brand and right now no ah somebody else for a piece audio ... okay I go\nThere so ah but I can if you like it would be funny though\nA brand in like I heard and I got going to take\nSome go seriously Don tweeted you he talks about you showing the picture of my son buck naked with the make America great again yarmulke\nSo I ask how much that in a secure the border Byrne that's okay ah so listen\nI Hope you know uh you you and I probably on the same wavelength here\nWe see these stories about these packages where these aren't even actual bombs they're made to look like bombs they have no debt Nader's there's not I mean there's nothing to them they're all sent on the same day\nIt appears because they were stopped yesterday to stop this morning and so they whoever did it fail dumped him in the mail the probably the same time\nSame kind of packaging every expert that I've seen and heard\nAnd I listen to live in a a dam bond Gino on yesterday former New York a police officer former Secret Service guy he knows about these things and he's like this is just amateur hour ... this is something that somebody is doing is they're either the dumbest person of all the time or they're just trying to create chaos in a diversion and\nI Know if you don't agree with me listen to this show there are plenty of people listen or even in the media you know I guess this is Craig how can you actually seen as scared that you think this might be set of before I even get to my ah my my explanation about that just thinking this okay if you don't think that the Democrats would be so desperate\nTo distract and change the narrative of news because they realize man even Democrats not politicians but people Americans do want fourteen thousand people storming the the border demanding entry\nThat we don't know who they are with nobody wants that nobody would be like if there's random people walking in your neighborhood is Fifteen people walking in your neighborhood and they're going from door to door would you open the door and let them in\nWould you be okay nobody would nobody would\nSo if you think that Democrats wouldn't be desperate as there are realizing this whole blue wave\nIs non existent non existent if you think that they're desperate to do that\nThey lied about four Americans being killed him and guys they lied about why it actually happened they arrested a guy for making a video and tried to put the blame on a on a guy\nWho made a video\nAnd of course it came out when Hillary was question for eleven hours in the media didn't really we have the audio of this media didn't really want to make a big deal they covered\nFor her when they actually one of the congressman actually said there are over six hundred emails addressed to you about security concerns from Benghazi they said we need reinforcements we need this many this why do these go on you know not addressed what would what is what is going on\nThey knew for a long time that\nThat was very vulnerable was ripe for attack\nKnew it and Obama sent out Susan Rice on five Sunday shows to lie and they continue to lie they do it if you're sick enough to lie about Americans being killed ... members of our military\nAre heroes an ambassador being left out they're ignoring them as they are under threats if you're sick enough\nTo actually say um that you know what this was a horrible horrible mistake about but you're you're willing to just cover it up in life for it yeah you know what you are sick enough and they had to say you know what we need something crazy seven to distract\nWe obviously screwed up with the Kavanaugh situation and and we couldn't paint him to be a bad guy Trump far back America's America bought it we screwed up we look like idiots\nIs old migrant caravan thing we can't look sympathetic anymore because Americans even if they're Democrats don't look at this as well let them all and it's okay it's just not what you do in any country it's not what you do\nSo what can we do you know what last ditch effort\nLet's tell people and try to convince them to not vote for any Republicans so Trump can lose power because he is causing crazy violence to take place he is causing what he says is causing\nPeople to put bombs in the mail and mail them to people that Trump doesn't like\nWas going to love you if you called ghetto right now and schedule a system we choose the nation is the best one hundred and twenty nine

didn't think he was getting a you know ... you know but you know hard core recording our reporting stories I just want you to know this Adam how's he tweeted out you have a lot of contacts and the federal government Adam how's he tweeted\nFrom fed source quote complete hoaxes\nTalking about the bombs the packages from fed source complete hoaxes multiple wires when the only when they only needed one reports of cell phones being involved with false so no intention of harm now the question dry run or a false flag from the right or left trying to mess over the other side\nOh\nSo Adam how's he that's what he says his federal sources are telling him Jake Tapper though fake news CNN tweeted out before that package justice or Obama's Clinton's Brennan here of CNN holder these devices for law enforcement sources were rudimentary but functional meaning the intent here was mass murder\nRudimentary but functional rudimentary but functional as a gym or\nScrew don't shoot up whatever from CNN said also\n\nA report that that time or had nowhere back actually hit on that ... that's exactly right arm o'clock alarm functions exactly right\nReally okay I can\nBuild ... good morning what's up and I think you're spot on I never thought of it now if you stay on it but I think you're spot on about this\nAll fake and and they're being generated by somebody trying to distract from\nThis caravan and all the other thing to do that over the here are we don't like that that all all seem to show that the way to actually get\nOn that\nAnd all of a bill they object to the gym that the Republicans are going to hold onto the Senate or they got to dry it got to have to drive the out there that the other way and um some of the vote away on the Republican\nOr maybe even motivates them Democrats to actually go vote or something like that maybe independence to go yet the trumps great great I think\nI think you're caught on to a ... not that may very well not not that somebody\n[laughter] we don't want to hurt anybody we don't want to hear Obama we don't want to hurt on the water we just want to send a a an opinion out there that it's gotta be somebody on the right yep we uh\nI think you're right on that [laughter] it sounds kind of your\n... you know and in ... thank you very much appreciate that you know the\nThe media will be like how can you say that that's crazy you got to take this stuff's seriously unless they don't take it seriously I'm just saying again\nThey're trying to change the narrative and give it to people to vote Democrat may have nothing else and this was desperate times and why would they not be able to do this after they literally tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh as life based on nothing\nUnconfirmed reports and they kept lying about it and again in this they lied about fast and furious\nAnd what happened to Brian Terry with guns came from the light about Benghazi I that's just me will continue it got much more coming up right now there were a little bit late six thirty six uh you know the it was actually an attack you know that there was some\nActual poisonous material mailed the Trump but you probably didn't hear about that did you funny how that works I'll tell you about that coming up here's Fox\nFox News I'm Chris foster that knowing is suspicious packages center critics of President Trump today is former vice president Joe Biden in

happened to bin ... leaving Americans including an ambassador to be killed by terrorists\n\nIf you know they're willing to do all this stuff you think they're not willing to stick some fake bombs in

Wallace a rhino working for him MSNBC's or she needs a paycheck she's got to say things that are crazy\nOr blame Trump just like everybody else here we go listen to Nicholas\nCountry has a long history of rough and tumble down on top I think is undeniably and a category of his own way today and someone who came to hang on to the right thing at a moment when he is sort of ... of our climate and he has contributed to more than anybody else in American politics\nWhoa yeah those were barred from the president largely and the teleprompter when I looked\nAt in there at the end because like he didn't really mean you know he's he's against violence it was only in the teleprompter\nSo he is responsible over and over I'm look I'm watching it and they also the same thing Trump's rhetoric can't be ignored Trump's rhetoric causes so you have all this so Democrats are hoping for is crap we we didn't get a Kavanaugh denied we couldn't convince the public that he was a sexual deviant and Republicans are because they back um\n\nUh we we can't we can't convince people are that this migrant caravan we need we need open borders that's not good people are mad at us they don't like fourteen thousand people coming to the southern border of America and demanding to be let in\nWe have no good economic plan we screwed up health care they're not buying the whole idea that they should trust us with healthcare we brought Obamacare that screwed everything up made everything worst what do we have we have not that I tell you what what is the only way we can get people to vote for us hey Trump\nGet it let's just put out these ... again this is my about this this let's just put out a bunch of fake bombs address to big name Democrats people that Trump has taken a you know as I said publicly that he\nDisagrees with now again Trump has not started these fights with these people these people started to fight to Trump but\nDoesn't matter big name people that Trump fights within public let's put them out there so people will think we can have Republican stay in power because we're going to have crazy things like this happen this I think is the last Hail Mary\nJust when we thought what else could they do after cabin on all this other stuff this this\n\nThey're hoping that they are hoping that people will actually sit back and say man Trump is causing this craziness to happen I I\nPublic and I can't do it [noise] that's my take on this it's just obvious these are literally fake freaking bombs and if you sit back\nAnd and not only do you use the same you heard it like an echo chamber\nAll the cable news channels and the network news Trump's rhetoric is responsible for this you can't deny Trump's rhetoric can't deny Trump's rhetoric these are people that Trump's email us ... you know what let's play number one hundred sleepy eye Chuck Todd this is what he said yesterday your ego ready to go\nBut let's be realistic it's hard not to say the obvious here at least politically speaking especially considering it was just going to last year Republican Congressman Steve ... was shot\nBy somebody from the left politically every one I just\nMentioned it's been targeted in this incident has been singled out by the president or strict defensively [noise] really [noise]\nHillary has said some awful things about from being a racist or sexist his the borders racist sex as big as this that blah blah blah\nLast week Hillary said we can't be civil until we get power back we played the soundbites for God's sakes so Hillary said that last week you have Obama\nSay in a a terrible terrible things about Trump\nIs this huge debts\nYou have Joe Biden challenging Trump to a fight you have Maxine Waters saying Trump's a racist or sexist we're going to impeach him needs to be out getting the faces of of people that support Trump getting the faces of people that work in his administration all that stuff\nDeniro saying F Trump played deniro got deniro bite by Bob De Niro we got to play by because this is very important\nIs is that the media is is terrible and and you see a nice ... member would deniro said this is what started the feud with deniro listen to this\nOne thing from [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nMm shakes his hand like uncle Leo and Raymond Raymond\nYeah so these are not people that Trump's saw it out to say I'm going to argue with you they all took shots at Trump they all took shots at Trump that's it\nTrump fired back at them Eric Holder all these guys they Trump fired back at them\nThat's it's\nEight eight zero can as the eight zero five six seven as the media as being one hundred percent dishonest with this whole situation\nI mean ... everything\nOh yeah yeah you know what Nancy Pelosi listening when ... he said last week listen to this good\nCall we owe the American people can be there for them for their natural ... ... ... and that country and there's some on\nCollateral damage ...\nPlus some others who didn't share veal well healthy at the head of the average purpose yeah\nIf you if you get hurt you don't share our view oh well greater good All right Ryan I just put in the control screen the Hillary member would Hillary said let's listen to this or we go\nYou cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but I feel that the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect strength\nI think this is gonna backfire of the Democrats again it's\nSo obvious that somebody planted this stuff they're all getting delivered at the same damn time same fake stopped the packaging all looks the same\nYou know you need to thank for this a red backfiring on them Al Gore he brought us the Internet and now you can get your news sources from everywhere not just the papers and tell them ... ... you're the\nBest is spread like wildfire sure does but you sit back and say Americans are going to look at this and say again they went after Kavanaugh they say crazy things they have NO PLAN the Democrats and not the ones that actually condemn antifa have they ever came over the ever condemned antifa ever\n\nGive me one instance when Trump talked about violence no tell me oh you did Greg G and forty body slammed the report him up\nHe was being facetious you was laughing me a break\n[noise] that's why he shot us\nSo a reporter if you can't hear reporters ask Nancy Pelosi and\nWe've heard from her didn't give his right at the ... and we have heard comments from Republicans including Congress about vitriolic rhetoric from the left being in some way to blame I went to the uh the question in there and you'll hear Nancy\nAnd we have are sounds from Republicans\nIncluding Congress about Israel like\nBeing in some ways [noise]\nWell I think that you have questions an excellent one and I think that the comments made by magnet public ... colleagues are outrageous yeah they need to take many of the job that they hold any dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command\nBecause you can't blame Democrats for this guy shooting up people you can't you can't do it let's continue throwing back over there just doesn't\nHave their they say such a thing but it's so ... so this sick individual ... ... ... yeah and it was horrible what he did all yeah but then to all the sudden they sanctimonious as if they don't never seen such a thing before\nWell have and I don't even want to go into president the United states but in terms of some of the language that his you know again I\nLet's go there and the other day that since you asked\nHow could they possibly have such as first of all and the timing of outrage and everybody is so sad so concerned ... coming together\nWhy isn't it happening now\nAll of a sudden these random hoax bomb show up and you blame the\nPresident's rhetoric

Cuomo's office one Cuomo's office denied reports it had received a suspicious package but he said it to Cuomo announced on the air his office received a device\nLet me let me go let me go the British ... over the number one Cuomo is a sequence of events go into the media governor Cuomo's office denied reports it had received a suspicious package bend to Cuomo announced on the air is office had received a device number three NYPD said the packaging question was simply literature\n[noise] what he wanted so badly this is what his own brother report he was his brother was mocking him on CNN listen to this right\nA couple of the packages were hand delivered the post markings on immediate help to them in that regard the package center the governor who yes as my brother Andrew Cuomo is my brother\nThat package I don't even know if it's related based on the recording it I've heard off there was no explosive device there's no powder their markings on the outside that are not similar to what happened in other instances like what happened here at CNN so I'd go slow on seeing that as related\nHis own brother it's like I go slow I don't even know when my brother said was related in these packages I I'd I'd go slow\nI goes when your brother who's the dumb one of the family is correct to use the governor you know things are bad\nSo I'm In my kids' soccer practice last night and I'm getting my I'm getting a text from a buddy of mine who's telling me oh it'd be sending me stories and everything else any course everything in this world rub\nRelates to Seinfeld so my buddies like dude and I have to clip for you he goes when when Cuomo was you know right off the bat I got a device I got a device it reminded him of Seinfeld episode where we're Jerry\nRejected a package guy shows up you have a package you're rejecting this back Jim rejecting the packages no return address so Jerry rejects the package from a delivery guy and then as he rejected George walks in and this happens\nPlus refused that everybody loves the package\nWas weird crazy printing I don't know it's from\nSo what do you think it's a bomb\nIt's not totally impossible\nThere you go on you [laughter]

freaking good\nTo good bye to let's go back to a Governor Cuomo real quick and they'll they will grab some calls or let's play the Governor Cuomo soundbite are idiots number Ninety five he's on this later on in the night\nLast night on CNN he's on his little brother show and it was really annoying they were going to little brother big brother a little while they were calling each other that on the on the it's like so let me let me straight I'm supposed to believe everything you say you think as a little brother you are going to rip your big brother even though he did say I'll give it to him you know I don't know if that the package my brother claims he got was\nActually related to all this stuff and it turns out it was an informational packet about a person\nI got a device abominable\nOh here's Andrew Cuomo again it's it's all Trump's fault that these random oaks bomb things are being sent that listen to this\nYou need is a big turnout he doesn't want to lose the Congress he wants to fire up his base and he's firing off his back\nThe lesson here is\nThat much hate\nMuch venom\nMob tell ya the bad people yeah there are people who are affected by that were emotional be [noise]\nAnd in this way down load from the Internet how to build the ball\nAnd when you are spreading that hate [noise]\nAh it's almost inevitable\nSomeone or some group is going to feed off\nSo there it is it's Trump's faults because he spreads eight and venom and everything else and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nOh the oh Trump's the one he's spreads that Haiti's spreads the venom he does he does all that stuff I mean I have an example of it here it is Trump spreading the hate [laughter]\n\nYeah there you go that that was mixing ... that was ... that that was amazing and it's like and that was Maxine knock off the first one to go after the second Trump and Pence and memory here's more from paid for Maxine Waters\nWe don't ask permission to protest [laughter]\nAmerica here at the

here\nYou're not welcome here anyway she bragging about threatening Trump supporters more I mean we ... we can go on and on if you'd like\nYeah why not well do it after\nEight until we got to get some calls and by the way there is a great story to you want to know why this is happening also the changing of the narrative and I think it's not just changing the narrative off the and it's like nonstop coverage of the freaking bombs right\nThese hoax bombs which I think they could be wrong but I think they're hoax bombs\nTerms of their real bombs they'd be talking about what was sophisticated about them and how they extended what they did it'd be everywhere\nSo it's not stopped coverage of this which is taking it off the migrant Caribbean even though we have not forgotten about the micro caravan and really twelve or twelve days out of election they were over a lot of us have already voted um but\nHere's a story in the Washington Post because again this is part of this story is to try to convince people to not vote for Republicans 'cause he got to take power away from Trump because he is inciting crazy people to send fake bombs or they think real bombs or whatever people\nTo enemies to silence them which is such crap we got to play the Trump soundbite from yesterday where he talked about all this stuff but he was a story for the Washington Post we'll get to this after calls as well ready for it ready for this just came out this morning the Washington Post ... are Democrats worry about twenty sixteen repeat in house races\nYou're ready for this after two years of energizing rallies fist pumping speeches and talk about a building blue wave Democrats in recent days have gone to feel a last minute belt of nausea wash over them oh no\nTerrified of reliving the G action they

points just a few weeks ago she said from a campaign headquarters\nSandwiched between the bake shop in a gun store quote the last poll we got back a couple of days ago at us exactly tied\nOh no\nOh no these are the ones that should be I don't want to say the easiest but really the ones that should flip from red to blue and this kind of climate she later said about district such as hers won by Hillary and twenty sixteen we can't do these ones on how on earth are we going to do the ones that are more read\n\nOf the twenty five Republican held districts that Clinton won Democrats are favored in Lebanon while Republicans are favored in three according to latest readings from cook Political Report which is full of it by the way but twelve are still toss ups and they're seeing a burst of energy and spending for both sides in a way that has Republicans feeling bullish and Democrats worried\n\nThe problem for Democrats says here their candidates are awash in attention the money is pouring into volunteers eager to help and many of these seats voters who live in the districts are proving more difficult to win over than Democrats once hoped\nMaybe because they actually like what's going on to the country with the jobs in the economy and they don't like the the author gutter everything that Democrats do with ruining Brett Kavanaugh organizing mobs not condemning this are being okay with people getting chased out to restaurants and yelled out in public places we don't want that in America\nWe don't want that so there we go there we go\nYou got to see this right you got to see this come you have to\nDemocratic strategist said it's a story of white college educated voters being disenchanted with ... with the Republican brand that's why we're competitive really\nDems are

I\nAm sitting here listening watching yeah that's Sarbanes urban thinking about a ... even though I never met him Ahmed all end with this kind of inspiration I Will go and take Trump out tonight [noise]\n\nBurn I haven't been earning were have meaning words have\nMeaning words have meaning don't take\n[noise] yeah [noise]\nWell this is why it's so phony it's so fake matter it was probably the montage this is so good\n... Jeff Flake space like ... like a male version of ...\nIt just occurred to me he is got this painful look on his face always ripping Trump only speaking in a monotone boring way always overreacting about stupid crap\n\nI Can't believe they are saying well corrupt I mean this is just outrageous you can have the why were sick and politicians get away with crimes\nScrew you Jeff\nOh way so a good old are you know Jeff Flake but we went on the\nView dude goes on the view you know what he says when he's on the view I I I'm really not sure if I Believe Brett Kavanaugh but I voted for him anyway\nWhich made all the crazies just lose their mind so they all love Jeff Flake 'cause he rubs Trump and then as soon as he says that they all turn their back he got attacked on Twitter by all the big time lives oh they went great you did just that they will they will throw you under the bus just as quickly as they praise you you do Jeff Flake\nAnyway oh yeah\nSo let's play the the awesome among Taj number eighty nine this is different members of the media yesterday blaming Trump's for these hopes bombs being sent nobody knows who sent 'em or why or how or what yet Trump's responsible listen as\nRhetoric senator against the news media CNN\nDebate of the American people for example faces I've asked do the violent tendencies at least in some people [noise]\nWhy I think that that's obvious I've ever concerned about this for a long time he thinks joke about it like in the Senate started in January of this rhetoric nobody's remember\nWe have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media she's a last week talking about the assault on reporter by congressman in Montana and saying that he that he is kind of guy [laughter]\nHard to see this outside of the context of the president's still itty ability towards towards Mrs Clinton who tried to briefly speak towards unity towards rock Obama tours George Soros the closet has it in the fall is always there\nAlways are right there did they really say do you speak to the unity the watch because Hillary said that because you don't have these fake bombs are dressed her watch\n\nCan you play what's on the control screen you have to cancel this out can you put Hillary spoke last week\nHillary said this\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's when the lady can start again\nBut until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect strength\nShe wasn't going for civility then now was she nope not until we get\nPower let's continue montage president and his allies they need to dial down to the political rhetoric they on making people let's say they are making journalists let's say and they were making law enforcement officers ... said oh\nWe don't know who are we don't know what their motive was\nRight but it's a very obvious thread and maybe it's meant as a ruse but it's an obvious threat the Obamas according to the armed Brennan's CNN um George Soros these are people and organizations that President Trump continually attack demonize them\nThey attack ... if you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nNot shake certainly one question for the president one question for the White House is the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks leading into mid\nMid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this\nIt's really incredible really incredible stuff\nAnd he also said that Republicans actually won in person early voting yesterday in Florida and that never happened at all and the twenty sixteen election\nIncredible stuff you mean it really is incredible stuff I might have to go uh\nBy the way that call was a a what a text to voice message on our on our thing yes on ... and it said a fake news fake bombs what's next a flaming pool on the porch raining pooh on the\n... oh okay I Gotcha I thought he had cool I'm like what the poop poop poop ... let's play some audio real quick All right uh I Know I Know it's terrible [noise]\nHere we go again one old shoe a columnist from New York Post on MSNBC is miserable again if you ever watch me ... show\nIt's just a bunch of somber gloomy people that think the end of the world is coming over I mean for three hours\nJumping Horowitz Haiti's never\nTrump or allegedly conservative columnist I guess from New York Post went on to 'em again Trump's rhetoric is responsible here we go\nIn the United states right now\nWe have solid economic growth we have lower unemployment [noise] we have all kinds of social peace but we haven't had him and we do have a country in the post war era yeah low crime a female yeah we have a lot of places we have some terrible things the opioid epidemic I mean we have an al yeah\nThis is an unusual circumstances and that's one of the reasons that it is fair to blame in terms of the president's rhetoric not only the president's wherever it but the rhetoric all sorts of irresponsible rhetoric to sort of rhetoric that has led led a that led whole component to shoot up a correctional softball\nGame oh but still trumps responsible somehow but have you ever seen anything by the way if you've ever seen anybody in the cable news era\nRipped Democrats\nAre pushing people to act like animals during the cabin all situation the cabin or confirmation act like animals chasing Republicans out of restaurants and they ... this is not how we should live no they never do it but then yesterday all about Trump Trump is the worst I have more to get you to talk about\nUm [noise] we got we got to
