I Do really well here as well\nAnd when you're talking about the two types of apples that you had your gored door ... golden door set in an apple and\nYou can plant others to experiment experimenting is always fun always something new I have [noise]\nSeven apple trees seven different varieties well that's how I started yeah Daryl Anna's now though [laughter]\nThought they were Hannah you thought they were different and they all turned out to\nBe an is no all the other ones didn't work so I never replacing it with what area do you plan is there you go so here's\nThe thing let's talk about experimenting with fruit it's not just about the cost of the tree you\nKnow and the cost of the tree can be anywhere from forty do you know hundreds of dollars depending on what kind of true you're buying\nIt's the cost of planting it's the cost of fertilizing it's the cost of wishing the tree into production and it's the cost of time so\nMy fruit tree program is called the fruit tree the urban farm for a treat education program\nIs designed to bring the idea of\nReally growing fruit trees in your yard and I teach people how to do it I give classes called three ways to ... your fruit trees so you want to grow fruit tree I'm I've been planting fruit trees here since Nineteen Seventy four\nAnd I've discovered even this year I've discovered new things about growing fruit trees and it's for the experimenting part if you want to experiment remember there was a huge cost involved not just the cost of the tree and for me the biggest cost his time\n'cause you know if you plan to fruit tree and it never makes any fruit and you take it out five years later you just last five years\nSo all of the trees that we bring in through the urban farm for tree program because we do education this time of year and people can free or to their trees and then the trees come in in January and February and then they plant them so that's the way my program works that's the way I found works best for planting\nWe've had great success so the trees that were bringing in I've proven over and over and over and over again that they're successful so I'm a fan of experimenting but know up front there's a huge costs of experimenting be careful with it\nLast week when Jay was in and we talked a little bit about tree planting just because this is such a great time to plant I'm well\nI'm going to take issue with that but go ahead\nWell I Know exactly where you're going so we're talking a lot that conversation was was gardening you know when you go to our roots over what was it ... the stem or the leaf of Yemen goes in right now yeah ... it's a great time for planting we talked about trees and if you're going to do\nA like an evergreen that would make sense but for January planting something that's dormant on her roots die if we planted it now it might start to grow just in time to start to go into dorm and its first season\nAnd I could see it being a much better strategy planting that bear route in January in January I went to her physically dorm absolutely\nThe other thing is is that all of the deciduous trees come in at the same time here in town we get them all the nurseries kept him in from the growers in January and we got them as ... which means there's no dirt around the roots\nAnd then we plant them from there so of deciduous tree this time of year has been in a pot for ten months that sat through the summer in a pot you don't really know how healthy it is I saw some other nursery than the last week that we're in pots\nAnd they looked terrible you know it's not the kind of tree I Would be buying and planting and so that the way we bring trees in we plant deciduous trees in January they come in ... there dormant when they're harvested in California and they're brought here on a truck and then we shield them in in mulch\nAnd you come and get them and plant them best time that way there\nAnd you plant them in the ground there breaking dorm and see where they're going to live the rest of their life\nNow experimenting you've got on your avocados and tropics have you have you had any successful experimenting with those\nTropical yes in fact I pick some pie as today I actually eating pie as an ... off of my trees\nI got to mangoes that we're going to see about I've not heard of anybody growing mangoes here but we'll see and the of the three avocados that I planted two of them are dead one of them struggling so I'm not a great big fan of avocados for here no they're highly experimental\nHighly experiments on I Know are the big plant or out in California Dave Wilson ... they've got one that they're trying to ah they've got a route stock that they\nFeel they are going to have a better success than they ever have in the desert southwest with ... and and I heard that I I Know that if it takes off that will be very popular 'cause we get asked about that all the time and just do this out there if you're trying to get avocado\nPlant grown in Arizona if there is a plant or they could have won successfully do it they would because they can see yeah they're going to make some money when they can find out you get one

that the fall you went to it's going to turn into a white winner we're not going to have that in a lot of parts of Arizona at least for most of the population is\nAnd the great thing about that if you want a white winter maybe getting a ... three hours two hours out there you go up to ... to the White Mountains we've got snow and we've got beautiful sunshine does the rest of it and you go\nIt is however not the reason I moved here no my parents moved me here when I was six kicking and screaming in the back seat so I didn't have much of a choice but I Love it here [laughter] but I Love it here\nWell good and you've made quite an impact with uh the urban farm as we're talking through your rules that you've developed other her trees yeah the fruit trees what about a talk show hours\nShe'll hours yep that that's a really important one is a tag on a tree doesn't tell you the variety and tell you this chill ours don't buy it in fact I was recently at another big box store and you know there's literally hundreds and hundreds of different varieties of peaches right\nThe tag on this particular peach said peach\nThat's it that's all it said it was like you've got to be kidding me [laughter] and you know somebody's going to buy that\nHe had gone on to a a a Sanderson Ford and just as car\nRight [laughter] exactly [laughter] exactly\nSo be really conscious about what you're buying and chill hours of one of them the next piece is root stocks and in my experience of growing fruit trees here in the valley for over Thirty years I have never found sands one I've never found a dwarf rich stock\nThat does well here in the desert none of the ... route socks work none of the peaches none of the apples they just don't like the soils here\nSo early we're talking about keeping trees small an eye on my mind automatically went well he must be using a lot of doors nobody you're not you know you're just spending that much time trimming our regular sized\nExact right stuff and it you know it takes a little bit more work out front\nBut once you have controlled the size of a tree\nIt'll stay smaller for you it really does work very well and that's part of what I teach and in December will be offering\nTree pruning classes at two different locations here in the valley and you can come down and get some hands on experience and look at how we're pruning trees and you know how to prune them for size so selecting the right rich stock is really important\nOnce again another reason to plug into archery tree program is 'cause I don't bring in any trees that don't have the correct root stocks on them\nSo he's got she'll hours we've got root stocks ripening times does that go back into play with your consecutive harvesting\nKind of okay here's this nobody knows this this is a an a widely unknown piece of data that I've discovered over the past Fifteen Years by planting out dozens and dozens of fruit trees getting them to fruiting viability and finding out so I experimented a lot to\nDo what you want to know about this is that if you're planting a soft flesh fruit tree\nAll your deciduous trees so peaches apricot plums to flush ... not the nicer to flush the fruit while we're on fruit okay lash fruit so Apple's peaches apricot plums grapes\nThose trees you want to plant a variety that rape and ... and his fully off of the tree by July tenth\nOtherwise they just cook on the tree I Know I've done it\nYou know I planted an August pride peach and it's a you know after five years I ended up taking it out they just don't make viable fruits I recently had somebody and one of my classes and she said oh\nThat's why my red Baron peach which is later July ripening that's why my red parents teach never does anything has been five years and I've never had a piece I said yep that's it\nIt's not a kind of teach you want it's a beautiful beach but good luck\nAnd\nTrying to picture the urban farm you've got a great big shade tree in the back by do could you can't even put it in uh\nThe protective shade of this big pine and you know keep it preserves out\nSo there is one thing here about this some people experiment my friend jak out in or out in Tempe she's got a pink lady apple that she gets some pink lady apples off though so you can get some fruit I used to have a nice Asian pair and my front yard\nAnd I planted it Thirty years twenty eight years ago at the urban farm as a little pencil sized tree and over the course of the next ten years it grew up nicely and I would get three to Fifteen fruits ear off of it\nSo then it's just a matter of is it worth keeping it for that little amount ... or in a mental or right do we need to switch it out for something function and act\nLike produce so and pears Paris let's see here here's the ones that I don't suggest that people plant pairs and ... and cherries the threes that they just they're almost impossible so\nGive the urban farmers and other states business guy was um they can't grow citrus so we've got to exchange going on here right exactly\nSo those are my three big rules around trees no you're chill hours no you're root stocks and know when they come right 'cause that's going to have you be successful right there\nAnd most of that should be on the attack the ripening one maybe not but uh most\nWell it depends often they don't have a route stock tag so the root stocks tag is different than the fruit tree tags so you should have at least two tags on your trees\nSo take no that ... the cool thing is you can do your research we all have smartphones these days if you're sitting there looking at a fruit tree and you look at the root stocks tag and it says name a guard for peaches look\nUp name a guard for teachers in the desert and ding ding ding ding euro bonus if it's not then go to the next one go to the next one exactly you know all too my own horn just come and see me I'll give you all the free education you want a guarantee our trees supports local and helps us out\nAnd now that's not what's going on at berries today to fruit you program you sign up and there'll be delivered in January when they all get delivered like you mentioned earlier\nCorrect so the September ... through December timeframe is learning how to plant your fruit trees how to make them successful this one I Do online classes I Do in person classes I've got\nMy three ways to kill your fruit trees class coming up on line this next week I've got so you want to plan of fruit tree coming up on line urban farm dot org the front page you can sign up for those free online classes takes about an hour at a time and uh you know honestly whether you get trees from me or not you want to come and take these trees because you're going to learn a lot\nAnd in that time between now and the planting we've got time to put an irrigation get to design select which varieties and yep do all do all the free work and then when we get our trees they're ready to go on the whole exactly\nNow on those three ways to kill you've got a a note here you're going to give us a little preview on some of that [laughter] yeah\nSo there's two major ways in a minor way that I have seen hundreds and hundreds of trees killed first one is we cook them\nBack on the corner behind the in the Carlos O'Brien's okay center you know that's right on the corner there and you'll be there from nine until noon is probably one o'clock is talking about\nPre digging holes what to put in your whole so we're a big proponent of\nPre digging your whole because how many people out there raise your hand of bought trees and plants before they never get planted my hand is up by the way and if you ... your whole you determine where your trees go you predict your whole what we suggest that you do is you put forty percent native soil back in the whole\nUh you put in former Greg's planting mix which is a really nice planting mix we had as a might Mike arise and were castings in the wheelbarrow mix all that and the wheelbarrow put all back in the whole now do that now\nAnd what that does is that starts developing the micro rise of the life in the whole so that when your trees arrive in January for just a Jewish\nAnd by the way that's the best time to plant deciduous trees and when you're citrus arrived mid February all you have to do as big a quick coal drop the tree and put your woody mulch around the base and you are good to go\nWhen you had your guest from tanks green stuff up a couple Emily broadcasts ago you were talking just about the lack of organic life in the desert so so all these micro raisins and these ... these yeah I had a third one in there that starts creating the life\nYes yeah our biggest job growing food really anywhere but specifically in the desert is to build healthy soil and you build healthy soil by but putting in good stuff no we don't use any chemicals it's all natural and you're really giving the tree a limb up\n... ... ... attack you're giving a trip with him up by doing that I like that yeah\nAnd that amount of time you're not going to like you said it's a really easy dig it's not going to be re compact and yet exactly beautiful back and then the roots will do the rest from the tree once they start growing it'll just it'll keep that from turning back in the native soil yeah\nExactly and then the other really exciting thing that happens this week is a this is the end of our early bird pricing on our fruit trees and next friday and Saturday I think this November second and third\nIs the open house at the urban farm so friday morning Saturday morning we will do a B doing an open house you can come by you can see fruit trees I've got you know ... I've got deciduous I've gotten most everything growing that I sell\nAnd you'll be able to see a growing you'll be able to come and ask questions about it I'll do tours and you know it's really informative and then you can also at that moment a re purchase your fruit trees for rival in January and February\nAnd I would find out the location of that and sign up at urban\nFarm dot org up right on the front page on the right side you can go to urban farm dot org and plus my classes and the next week I'm three ways to get your fruit trees and so you want to plan of fruit tree are coming up as well\nNow I'm going through your order form here you've got ...\nOh did you so much fun you know what they are no oh it's a it's a little apple they start out at about a golf ball sized apple and you let\nThem dry on the tree and harvest them and they taste like chocolate they are the most amazing candied chocolate and you know the Jew Jew be candies didn't I mean they swiped it from the Jews you'd be trees because it's just an amazing amazing\nYou'd mentioned earlier as well cherries don't work but you've got to seven berries on here\nSeven berries berries do really well here really the ... the best berries are two different mold berries and yes there are legal to ... their yes it is legal to plant\nMold berries female mo berries here in the desert and there's the dwarf black mold Barry Bush which puts out about a dime sized absolutely incredible ... and then there's the Pakistani military which puts out a three inch long\nUh amazing buried those are my two favorite berries for growing here for the rest of them do great\nAnd we didn't even hardly covered grapes I Know you mentioned it when you were giving your soft skin example of grapes but yep three varieties of grapes yeah regularly well I've got a lot of trees but the the berries and the grapes and uh that may have to be the priority for the seeds and there you go\nTwelfth street northern from nine until noon issue today come down and see me and my crew and we'll talk to you talk with you about planting trees\nLooking ahead on the calendar as well to force Saturday November's can be Thanksgiving weekend or we're going to talking growing turkeys at the urban farm\nWell there you go now although I've done that before I'm I'm much more of a vegetarian now not\nAnd I'm sure your neighbor and appreciate not living next to live Turkey's I've got a neighbor to the west to me that has turkeys and oh when they're quiet they're quiet when they're not looking\nSo next month we're going to be talking about growing winter garden because [noise]\nReally the best time to grow here is October through June\nSkipped July August and September take a vacation you know do your winter planting but now until February is a great time to be pointing out your garden so join us next month as we talk about running a winter garden\nAnd it's been a couple of years since we had a hard hard freeze and I ...

Dennis thanks for coming down the Saturday morning thank you very much ... glad to be here\nSo let's start with windows probably the biggest thing we're going to fix the fastest there could be some other things inside the home they're breaking may not be so urgent but how do we know if it's temperature temperatures were just all\nWell first of all if it's ... it's going to break into a million little pieces who's going to be all over the place it was just a Neal glasses is going to ... maybe splinter\nAnd you'll see some splintering into the glass and sell some of them I had a falling out of but most times it's going to be very careful you can take over at ... for safety temper glass you're gonna have to break it out and kind of let it fall to the ground so you can clean it up\nAnd you'll find tempered glass around the house for the next year probably but to it because it's just breaks and such small pieces but it's considered safety glass and that's the most important\nThing and the reason that safety glass is because they're because when a breaks it blows up into little tiny pieces and it just ... their skin if it hits you and it doesn't cut you like a regular class with as opposed to these big heavy discharge that fall down on and on and get\nFeet like Bruce Willis you know so that breaks if it's tempered were just reprint it up I'm recalling the glass shops that writes temper if it's not tempered and it's still all in place tape it and it tape it\nYou can tape it up you can keep everybody away um sometimes it'll it'll fall out you just got to be very very careful when you called the glass company we can come in at least helped get things tore apart and cleaned up\nSo once you've got it cleaned up to have to put a whole new window and can I get individual glass squares that can go back into the censor\nWell in today's world we live in the world of insulated glasses to two panels ... an outside panel in an inside with the space from between so normally see outside panel that's broken so you're still secure in the house so you don't have to jump around trying to find something right away\nYou call your glass company they come out and they measured\nNine times out of ten and what will happen is that they will order a brand new panel\nThey'll come back after they get it back from the factory and they'll come back and put it in a ... that's the best way to do that that way as a factory they can clean both inside panels with are nice and clean for ... before they seal it and then you you don't have any problems after\nAn unsealed anybody that's had condensation between their windows they know what an unsealed duo pain looks like a big foggy ness\nDoes sometimes it looks like a fish bowl of compensation\nOkay so that's taken care of the class but on those panels especially the ones that move up and down pretty prone to some other maintenance issues there well\nThis ... you know in the fall in the spring all of a sudden you go out to open your window because you like to some nice cool air to come in the open the window and it just fault the window just fall straight down\nThe window hasn't gone bad it's just the balance or is that keep the window up have gone bad the springs broken the clips of broken something's happened\nAnd so nothing that's you have to take a lot of time to do you discover glass company out they'll tear the window apart take the balance or see what kind they are put the window back together so you lose your house is sealed\nAnd they order 'em and come back out in a few days and put them back in\nAnd something you started recently just because of the amount of repair she'll do with windows is that the ... they don't have a long lifespan they're affordable they do a great job in their their five ten years Arizona son south west side and nothing would survive out there and that's a problem\nThe screens all of a sudden get a little terror in the bugs are rolling in and most people say I don't really have time to go out and get new screens they like to take their screen to are like a glass shopping when are glad that we have a screen shot there that we screen for you using your existing frame and that surge saves you a little bit of money we can do it in a few days\nNow real quick there are still a number of old single pain window still out there that haven't been replaced from the seventies and sixties and fifties is that an easy fix or is that your tipping point that hey it's time to upgrade to New Delhi we\nYou know there there are a lot of old single pain when is out there we used to work on them to fix a lot of um um the the sliding window you're able to take that out very easily and bring it into the shop and we can repair for you right there at the shop and give it right back to within twenty thirty minutes\nOn the stationary as little more difficult to tear it apart so most of the time we come out to repair that All right there in the field will come out measure the glass you can cut the grass and the side of the truck but it back in the frame and you're we're off\nAfter ... and go everyday everybody's happy\nThat statement made me think of something I wanted to talk about it to a beginning of the segment we said cut the class classes a liquid sorry you're really cutting [laughter]\nYeah you're actually putting a score on the glass and then you put a score and then you can either put a pencil something underneath and you can break the glass\nHalf I I Need to see a clash factor 'cause I always wonder how do they take sand and make it a liquid glasses sand and it's a liquid but you see through how how is this possible [laughter] it's\nPut into a big molten that in the weather does is that as the glass as the ... and comes off the flow goes onto the float line\nIt comes off at about sixty feet a second is running pretty fast as it comes off they're putting more into the into the vet to keep the level of a glass of the ... at a certain height\nAnd as that goes along the molten comes across at different sicknesses and as it does it cools and as it cools it clears and as you get it out there they got laser cutters cutting as fast as they can to stack it and get things going\nHow long does it take that process for that than to hit your shop\nWell for us I mean I'm depending on where it's manufactured ... it was manufactured in the United states um we have a distribution center here in town and they get they get glass delivered every day so we can get cases the glass as we need them so it takes about ... about three weeks\n[laughter] I I Love industry and and the supply chain of things that we'll think about it and take for granted in our daily lives until something breaks and then what\nYeah but you know it's it's one of those things you want to go to 'em and and watch on TV but they never put that that kind of stuff on TV for you to watch how you make class you know where's Mr Rogers when you these\nWhere is he [noise] so let's go inside the home ... glass tables class shower doors\nWe do a lot of glass shelving people or redecorating constantly they've got new things going on we do a cheerio cabinets or people should come out from other parts of the country out to Arizona material Kevin shelves break\nMake a lot of those shelving or and nowadays it's there there's the heavy thick glass and everybody's putting 'em ... and things on top of that and really screws up their bar areas and stuff\nCould make it very well could be is it only at the kitchen faucet\nYes yeah um yeah what what okay well what\nYou see I'm I'm suspicious that it is just the faucet okay and you could test that by the U.S connecting the hot side underneath the counter okay and crack the valve on the wall\nAnd fill a bucket and just see if if it does if it does it not if it does it that way this is something that just recently started yet yeah it's probably the faucet if it's not the faucet that we developed a something has changed maybe in the way the pressure at the house\nAnd we may have to go to like a little mini arrest or mounted right there underneath the kitchen sink which is really easy to do a and that limits the air hammer that causes that that that's the vibration inside the pipes\nBut try it with the angles stopped valve and a bucket see if it does it if it doesn't then you're probably going to just replace the faucet and be all set [noise]\nLet's see if we bring Nancy ended the conversation Nancy\nMorning calling from Phoenix good morning\nMy mother and living in a house that has a son getting living room and we would like to cover that in so that it's even with the rest of the flowering around it that we don't know what the best process\nYou know when you get a couple of guys out there and take a look at it you may get a guy or two that tells you\nLet's just put some too by sixes are too by eight down and put plywood on top of that to bring it up flush we don't like that method at all Nancy it's been putting would\nDown below grade it ... it creates a condition conducive for termite infestation\nIt's much much better or what we do is we go in there and we cut the sheet rock up above the floor 'cause right now as you step down and living in the sheet rock goes down all the way to the floor\nWe chock a line and we cut that and we get it completely out of there and then there's generally little offering strips\nThat are mounted on the ... we have to get those out of there\nAnd then we filled the whole thing with ABC's ill and four and a half inches a concrete uh and then the electrical receptive goes around the outside perimeter of the house probably have to be raised 'cause you don't want the electrical receptacle two inches above the ground you know above the British more grow\nAnd if you measure the room I can tell you to do it right what we like to do before we do all that is we go in and we termites treat underneath that whole area because once you didn't have\nFour inches of concrete four inches at ABC four inches a concrete is four inches ABC sometimes that area can be hard to to treat should termites ever come\nSo we saturate the area which are my pre treat that we put in a B. C. that were put into concrete would cut the sheet rock we raise all the electrical receptor goes patch the ... patch the drywall get ready for painting and then you can put whatever for cover you want in there when you were done\nGenerally speaking if you measure the room\nYou're going to be between twenty and thirty dollars a square foot to do that right\nAnd then what about letting the concrete care like how does that\nWork out that's a great question [noise]\nThat'd be great well generally what we do because that's a lot of humidity inside the house because as a creek cures people\nPeople calling curing it's really not curing its hydrated you're you're off gassing a ton of humidity and we generally just put some fans in there we don't blow the fans right onto the concrete surface we point them up into the room just to keep the air circulating\nThat accelerates it a little bit you might consider having this done before your mom lives in ah yeah and and and then within a within a couple of days you're pretty good shape what for covering would your mom what back down when it's done\nPutting carpet down\nOkay we'll carpet can go back down generally after about four or five days if you're going to go with ... we have to wait a little bit longer than that\nOkay and you have any company to recommend\nAt where is the house Nancy\nI'm the next thirty Fifth Avenue in Dallas area\nYeah I uh I Believe a T WD would do that Kirk development would do it both rosy certified ... hours and rosy remodeling we do it we do it fairly often so it any one of those three companies\nAre depending on how busy the other guys are this is this kind of consider a smaller job\nAnd depending how busy they are they may or may not be able to get to it the Rosie loves small jobs if if I could just do small jobs that's all I Would do a ... you get in you get it done and you go to the next one\nThese jobs that you go on and you're there for six or eight or nine months\nI Do I get a little Democrats get worn out there right okay and let me ...\nAnd that's it you can just dial this same number you dial to call the radio show just dial that number during the week and let them know you you want somebody to come out and take a look at it until in the do you all have keys to the house yet\nI'm now it's about three weeks out and then she was going to do some of the um changing out of things before she actually ...\nYeah okay we'll just call that the number that puts you in touch with Rosie remodeling Monday through friday and we'll send somebody out measured up or you can give you a specific written detail\nOkay well thank you so much\nSo you're saying yeah you bet that's who we appreciate it okay\nYou know as a a little rosy remodeling company uh we're looking for good people\nIn the business and you want to make a step up in your career\n\n\nYou're buying or selling home I don't have to tell you what\nWould I Do have to morning on the walls of the homeless veteran and let me tell you shall not all homeless ...

truth that's why you know there's different there's different techniques for ... straight lines you know you can use water levels um you can use lake water love it yeah water levels basically a PVC two\nI'm twenty to thirty feet long filled with water and water six at some level so you can hold one end up at the elevation you want to create the the line or the graphic take the other end\nAnd it'll find its you know she seek level with itself and then you can basically just you know go from there and establish should get straight wind and you can make hash marks every three to four feet to ensure that you are following a good line lasers or an easy way\nYou know thirty forty dollar laser uh one of the hardware stores or something you get a good good wine out of that too so\nAnd once the tape is on we've got to make sure we've got a good bond I've even seen guys that will go behind and\nPut a little little tiny beat of Koch right on the edge and today the old school\nWay yeah and that's that that's still a something that's necessary on some of the ... or more heavily textured surfaces\nSo the the tape that has the product on the backside that moisture activated works very well on some of the smooth surfaces you push the edge down and you get a good tight seal and then once the paint hits it um the product activates and he ended up with a good ...\nUm you know heavy ... you know textured surfaces that are a little more heavy in in nature that's the way you'd you'd run the tape you don't need the special tape for that you use regular masking tape\nAnd then you take a um some talking running along that edge take a wet sponge kind of melt that talking in a little bit seeing barely see the tape edge\nAnd then you paint it and the trick is that you pull it while it's wet um if you let the paint dry sometimes the the the paint bond is stronger and you'll end up feeling are fraying that tape it so the trick to that is\nAs you as you're painting that you pull it a rate immediate ... ... or no or if that does you put on\nWeight it on much yeah yeah now what about the tape with I never liked anything over and she and a half maybe to those those three and four inch actually seems\nTo come or something we have what's the purpose of this super\n... yeah there's a there's times where um\nFor instance having two inch tape\nIs a more practical way of protecting a space such as in between casing and an um an an adjacent wall that perhaps has an accent color or something like that and I'm trying to do with paper or free hand you know a cutting it in as a a good option\nAnd uh so you can just run in our appropriate with a tape down that particular strip\nGenerally speaking you want to I'm just use a um the smallest with\nAh as as is necessary to accomplish a good bond in between the area to try and protecting the adjacent area you're painting\nAnd then use a paper on I'm asking machine with that tape is a good way to just kind of run an apron if you will of protection of such as base board or something like that where you would run a um masking machine and then slide your drop caught up underneath that you're in good shape\nAnd on your masking machine it's a hand tool that has\nA a spot you put your tape on and then it comes around and it connects to\nEither role of paper or all of plastic do you have a preference on paper plastic or when you use one versus the other uh well they have what's called ...\nSeventy two and Ninety six inch masking film comes in roles like the paper does\nWhat that's a designed to do is if you had a large area of wall of let's say that you needed to protect 'em\nAnd you were a going to be rolling the ceiling next to that wall\nUm it's a lot easier to use the ... film um because it dispensers like ah the paper does\nAnd then you basically just unfolded down to the um Seventy two or Ninety six inch whichever you know uh Rowley button and it's a real easy way to cover a large amount of wall surface very quickly versus holding up you know ... plastic disc clean and trying to tape and\nAnd get that into place um the paper is something they usually use like an apron I'm Around in areas such as base board and sliding a drop crop up underneath it\nThat way you don't have to um mask\nA uh a lot of flooring or something like that and it's a good way to to just have some good protection anywhere from four to six feet out off of the wall um they do have some different um a a paper products for the masking machines\nThey have regular paper which is a good for general purpose uses\nUm if you're worried about any kind of material\nUm leaking through the paper and being absorbed by the paper they have the green a paper and that um will prevent any moisture in the ... the product from actually being absorbed and and reaching through the paper and to the foreign\nAnd just to give anybody a good perspective a when they're working on their own paint project for a professional how much time or your crew spending masking protecting versus physically applying the paint\nIt's that's a great question I'm\nAs a general rule ah if you were ... interior rooms in your in your house or something like that about sixty five Seventy percent of your time is spent in either cover protection or prep of the surfaces\nAnd then the remaining amount twenty to twenty five applying and five percent cleaning up\nUm one tool or masking tool that I think really was a very smart if you're painting doors how much time if you wasted but that little blue tape trying to get it around the curve edge of the hands have you seen\nThe door hinge it's designed to just go straight over the metal plate you don't have to sit there mold your tape around yes yes uh well\nI I'm a I'm a proponent of actually pulling the hardware off um I think in the end you end up with a with a better a finished product as it moves into that more to Syria where were the hinges are bad at\nUm you had to be real careful it the hard wears off and you're using a roller to not leave a bunch of paint product they're you know just have to cut it out sure to get that hinge plate to fit flushing yeah yeah\nThat's right and and a lot of times to to just kind of help that out what I'll do is take the screws that pulled from the hinge um and then I'll tape 'em right to the more to stereotype\nThe gym that will prevent them from getting you know uh any kind of build up there\nYou know take a razor blade as well before you re fast and the hinge and just clean that little edge up with a razor blade pretty quickly\nOr

apps were from men you paint manufactures none of them were independent of manufacture correct did they all restrict your options to their own color we'll [noise]\nUm yeah they all kind of suggests that their own colors you know for example when you use that the done at a word that they provide you with John Edwards colors and and they're special names for their colors\nWhich makes sense it's not like they've got to other companies color we'll probably program in their\nTheir software but and both regards I mean the the variations and the the look of color probably most human eyes couldn't pick out right yeah you've got quite a selection with both ah both companies so how does it work last\nSo I tested out these sure when Williams color snapped okay and so basically you you open it up\nAnd you have a few options on what you want to do you can either take a picture of whatever room you're standing in and say you already have a color in mind that you want to use it you know the PIN number the name you can look that up apply it and you click on who I'm your finger just right on the wall and it will completely apply that color you are and all\nI have my smartphone I'm standing in my kitchen right and\nI've got a a solid wall okay you know the ... behind me my walls over here got a little Nick over there so I've I've got my smartphone and rode the white right now okay I have a way I'd take a picture or I Will take out you'll take a photo\nWill just that's the thing about the sure when millions out there's two ways to do it actually I can do it in real time as they call it there I'm\nLike you're reading a cue are coated it takes a picture yeah it'll ... it'll yeah\nAudie up that automatically recognize through your camera different surfaces and it'll let you know services you know I've been recognized tap a color to paint the surface\nAnd when you use that they believe it's called in to pay\n'em the color of the quality of the colors are so great when you just take a picture and I think that has to do with the real time loading colors ... can get a little bit pixilated when you move the phone\nOkay but it does give you a good real time you know you can sort of do A Panoramic move the phone around and see how the colors were especially if you're in a larger room\nBut then you also have the option of just take a photo and\nIf you have a color in mind you plug and play and see what you like\nAnd so you're just changing the color on that wall on your phone to see what it looked like until you're happy\nRight and then you know say you don't know the color and they have another feature there which is a they call it picture match or explorer color and\nYou take a photo of anything you hit okay and the app itself will recognize it and pop up little blurbs with each different shade and the names and so say you have a maybe a plant outside or rose and you really like to call it you can actually take a photo and see if they have something that closely matches up\nPaint color that would match the rose to bash the inside of color you're looking to fill in your home\nRight yeah they got something close to it you'll you'll get a result for that\nAnd does it offer multiple results or do you have to like didn't go in and say here's the result I found on your app can have your ... and see color shades on either side of it\nIt actually will let you it'll show you the exact color he looked at and then you do have options to go through that picture or that particular few that range of colors whether you know from start to light\nSo can you say the roses dark red you can go all the way to maybe violet to pick you know show you that sort of range between colors\nNow this is all been color selection is that where the app ends or can look at this wall and do that it's twelve feet wide eight feet tall so it calculate your square foot and how much pain product you need\nUnfortunately no it does end with just the or the color selection but I bet you that's coming yeah do you pitch that to their marketing to enjoy the game that I did I\nGive 'em away dollar idea alive [laughter]\nJust handing out idea [laughter] that's the Sherman Williams at Gen John Edwards work the same way I'm\nPretty much it's a little bit more limited than these showing Williams apso or done other words they have the ... to color at a and I have an Android so I went to the Google Play store and I just started typing John Edwards\nOkay that's a great Lance was this on iPhone or Android that wasn't Android both of these have been injured okay yeah so you're the only two and the officer on and [laughter] probably I think I should have something like that three oh Jerry guy again\n[laughter] um so uh you know go to the the play store um they started typing and John Edwards and I've done other words into color apples what popped up right away\nAnd as a suggestion and when you go to install it it does have a couple of permissions on like at once access to your photos on than your camera but it uses that like the ... and you point your camera at\nA color or at a you know like we are saying that on a bloom perhaps you have a beautiful purple Bush outside and you really want that purple and you can point the camera at that Bush and it will pick up the different colors um so when you're in the app", "show_name": "Rosie On The House",

than\nAny one man in my life and we lost ... five years ago and we continue but uh we have a very diverse set of genetics we have the largest\nGene pool of capital Manama in the world and we do more research than than anybody at any research station any college\nAny university or anywhere and I don't mean that arrogant that's just kind of what's happened and so we do we were blessed we get to work with Dr rod wing here at the very end of the molecular division and Steve Hansen was my producer division in Mexico state\nWhat you're looking for it all the molecular study of [laughter]\nThat's\nFun\nAre we looking for oh\nWell for one thing you know the basics good question the basics number one we're looking for how you all for the grower and what really put put us on the map was in the early nineties uh the the Chilean history is growing and as you guys know you get\nIf you get on one plant you might get some hot chili and you might get some mild\nAnd is this and I didn't know yeah absolutely and the early days that's the way it was ... he consistency was very difficult was nature's box of chocolate you just never knew what I mean it it it it you just never know and and for this ... industry to spread and as we all know\nA Mexican cuisine has really grow\nAnd for it to grow into the north and east\nWe couldn't burn people up because the first time somebody got hot chili they were done you know and and and I got some hot ones in her will will talk about that in a minute but you know you can just smoke somebody and that's that's tough they don't want it after that uh\nSo what are what really brought us to to the forefront and breathing was we were the first ones to come other stabilized heat level genetically so that so that this industry could spread and it did in in\nOur our first friday was Arizona twenty in Arizona\nVery stable and he almost two mile\nGrassy uh it it it it the heat in itself\nA there's many is the number a reference to the heat index school the school you know okay come on it but but then inside the Scoville unit is there's there's an hydro zing die hard ... and we all know that you eat one you know like a jalapeno hits you one place in your mouth or\nOther chilies hits you in the back of the throat some Chile you eat it\nAnd five minutes later and go ... you know I think that things getting hot little bit on the meal is getting really hot [laughter] so the whole ice cream that bad yeah exactly you know ... you know it's always interesting fruit because it's the only thing we that gives us coming and going into what I mean\nJust a little bit of humor\nWell hey and run our family is going to lead to try your chili peppers and because they love to cook and you guys get pretty spicy right\nYeah they don't like it they heat and there's a lot of good recipes right there on your on your plate dot org with you can\nIf you need some ideas for that yes he is chili peppers and the only thing that's lacking right now that ed promises me we'll get those on there is some recipes from his sister and his wife that can really add an enhanced that whole list of recipes that feature\nAre Arizona chili peppers and so\nWe're talking about the different types of chili peppers and we're talking genetics one of my stat sheet there are how many different sets of jeans and a chili pepper well\nYou know that's a that's an interesting question first off I'm going to ask you how many genes do you think Romeo human has\nYou know I've only got four [laughter]\nI'm up by Sunday I area but they I think we're going to have these laws back to the subject\nLevis language and exactly\nA human has roughly twenty two thousand pairs of genes I mean there's there's there's\nI have more in my class and she has more and her father but you know technically the real science says Nineteen thousand five nine hundred and something I forget exactly but give or take twenty to twenty two thousand genes and we learned more all the time pepper [noise]\nMy original study showed forty two thousand and that's what I talk to kids in classes for years uh but\nRecently UC Davis that a new study and comes up with that there's a little over thirty thousand but nevertheless whether it's thirty or forty thousand\nIt's still much more diverse than even we as humans and our job as breeders is just to separate those gene packages out and I love to talk about Jean packages 'cause it's really fun if I say to your roaming\nAround as you say what her brown or if I say to your blue eyes you say what ... ... if I say red hair you say what fair skinned right typically and ... and ... so my job is to make a Franco brunette\nYou know [laughter] my job is is to take these gene packages and and and because the they run in packages\nAnd we're trying to take the best of certain things and put it was the best of other things and leave the genes we don't like behind its fun guys I'm telling ya gotta live to be a hundred and fifty years old to get some of this stuff figured out it is fun\nAnd and you know to me if you don't see God's handiwork and what I Do boy you you're pretty blind because this thing there is the first genes in saying it's amazing\nAnd you're a fourth generation farmer yes or a no disrespect but I'm going to just go out on a limb and say you're probably not going to make it to a hundred and fifty do you have a fit sign of racial coming up hey we're learning from yeah\nWhere are you in Chile this one has more vitamin C. than to oranges and we make it you don't have a lot you\nOr you just slice ... what what are your show and you know what I was going to show you\nGood question what I was going to show you is and this one's not I thought I ... I Know I've got one in there that's hot but this one's not very but the kept science and runs down the placenta wall and and so anytime\nYou want to fool your friends and and make them think you can eat hot chili used to take the slice that doesn't include the placenta wall\nAnd and and then give them the placenta wall and they're going to get the cap science and medicine a wall is that ... that in the right side regret that's where the cedar develop you know an interesting thing most people will tell you hold the seat is hot in and of itself sees Moha\nIt's only the the reason the seed is often perceived as hot as because it kept science and has developed on the placenta wall or the seed is attached and it spreads to it\nNow we have a mutation that we're having a lot of fun with right now and that is it starts ... vein a vein that never that's a that's a medical term it basically means that it it doesn't quite mature\nAnd and the sexual organs it's actually a medical term but at the same and plants and the placenta wall when it doesn't quite mature\nThen it sends these these these faults percentage down but it's also sending kept science and we've had a lot of fun with those because to have a chili with the heat in the meat is is is very different\nOnly roads are now so you get on our birds bees and hot peppers and\nAnd I try to get it All right here\nAnd Ed Curry is my best example of a farmer with a lot of enthusiasm and in this case about chili peppers\nDo you suspect that your home is settling cracks in the wall or sloping floors doors and windows out of square

crossing it's it's a a\nA\nYellow bright yellow pepper it we have it in hot mild some medium\nIt's it's we really haven't releases burger yet but some of our tests have gone have showed that has a [noise] a nutritional value of a hundred times that of spinach and that basically what you're looking at is the lieutenant as he is an some panels\nI didn't need another excuse not to finish what I got another one now\nNow he's just really did have to eat a hunter down to the Spanish State to one ounce of this chili that\nTraditional value and in in in fact we we've had a lot of interest on that soon and and I need to clarify not all the tests are that high that was the peak it's fun to talk about that one because that one was the ... but the handle\nOf looting that's the one thing that that our listening audience I I really like to share this is the nutritional value of Chile the the\nAntioxidants the vitamin C. the vine may the vitamin D a peppers are very very very healthy and uh and and this has been a fun project because genetically I\nWhat do you try to do when you say it's a project is it that color or is it the the nutritional value or is it the flavors that all of that rosy what are we trying to accomplish with that pepper\nThis flavor is unbelievable I and my sister roasted sermons or my mom and dad are yesterday or day before some of this 'cause I I wanted them they obviously they've been in the chili industry for many many years and\nThen and so I take my new stuff down to them hey what do you think you know this thing is unbelievably sweet I'm ... probably most folks have either a yellow tomato or or a yellow watermelon kilometer watermelon\nWell this is kind of a twist on that\nI was actually looking for the color originally don't want to use this for when I lecture to the ... students in New Mexico states students that come to the farm and and when I uh I could show them a block of this and show how breeding works and show how separates and show that typically if we make across\nLet's see we take a\nYellow bell pepper and cross it was a purple bell pepper\nThe first year you're going to have a hybrid enough one and the hybrid is going to\nGoing to pretty much whatever it turns out it's going to look pretty much consistent but then you grow the two and then it starts split up and that's the fun part that's the ones that are and says because twenty five percent of them are going to be purple twenty five percent of them are we going to be yellow on the plant\nBut then in between that fifty percent is all kinds of bland and that's where I call during the gene pool up\nAnd then we start select and then I have a team I have a minute around ... and David Corn meal in a a nine year old daughter and then an an an another fellow Ramon that work with us and they've been with us for years and they love it we have so much fun guys you know my growers in New Mexico\nUh because we furnished the seat or whether it's kinda fun in the fall they get\nMostly done with harvest in there on the mountain hunting milk I tell him all while they're on the mountain ... milk I'm In the field hunting chili 'til their lives can be better\nAnd and we love it and and and to be honest I don't want to go to the mountain and hung out I Want to be in my chili feel that we provide our own entertainment you know what I mean I Love what I Do if if you don't go away with anything else did they know that if I die tomorrow\nI Love what I did in life\nIt's it's absolutely fine you know what I my conclusion is chili peppers and allowed you to play lay goes as an adult\nYeah pretty much genetic lego genetic absolutely any genetically modified\nWell not as a gym or like something shot this is all done ... ... it's all done old fashioned that's why it's taking me twenty twenty plus years to get to this\nBut as as I was saying here in the legal field when I Would show that the kids when the classes would come well it was real easy to see a red and yellow chilly it was real easy so I could show them that twenty five percent of one twenty five percent another in fifty ... it was a great teaching tool\nAnd I love to teach I mean that's that's the joy elections to watch these kids later we host FFA feel they ever ever first friday in November\nAnd and kids come from all over and then they compete and we get first place prizes and the fun part is we have a hot chili eating contest now that is the challenge three years ago a little beautiful blonde haired girl was winning and I'm telling you guys in boys were trying to outdo her and\nAnd and they were eating hot chili tell finally they were uh you know what I mean it wasn't staying down I'll just say it that way on the air\nAnd and uh but it's so fun and the kids love it in and they leave the farm understanding a little bit\nAbout what it means to select and and and pepper is so diverse\nEvery country in the world except for the the ones around the Arctic Circle in the north have their own pepper every country while I imagine\nSo so when you travel Mexico and I've I've I've I've been in lots of places in Mexico looking for chili then it's so fun you get in there and there's these little villages a column I he those\nAnd they're proud of their chili because their ancestry selected in selected in selected not knowing anything except for that certainly better\nThan you know what you can hurt a set of genes even that way\nThat's why it's really bad when the big tall guy ... tooth woman you know\nYou get kind of a funny or you know for humor for the day before I got there I'm picking up chili peppers in bags\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to the cw radio music\nYou'll miss the iconic performances ya\nTo miss [noise]\nAh because I started getting the point where I was concerned because I knew she wasn't going to get much rest if I came to ban the same time you know she's been so used to me ... all the ... radio\nYou're listening to seven o'clock hour you can talk about a chili recipe will now you know why we have egg curry curry farms and Julie Murphy with\nArizona Farm Bureau it's our first Saturday of the month we always bring in somebody from the farm bureau and Julie you sent me a list of chili pepper facts we cover a couple of more of those cars I\nThe details and and I don't know I'm ...\nYears ever won surely fact I'm going away with today you spent Fifteen to Twenty years developing a genetically specific\nPepper that you're growing at one bumble bee can mess you up\nOn my game the mind is that I went out to Chile and that equals a hundred announces a spin it you're good for\nAlright generally what you really well one of the ones that I thought it was pretty cool is how\nLong they believe that the chili said and chili plants have been around and I think something like six thousand years so ed can you have nothing on some some of the ancient tribes that have developed they said over the years but you're the guy that really made it\nMade it pretty unique for what we do here in Arizona and the other thing that strikes me about everything that ed told us today is how farmers really help one another and our dependence on another we may be ... developing a lot of the genetics here in Arizona but it's our New Mexico farmers are growers that are\nProducing it and making sure that it gets on our shelves so and let\nMe throw in Colorado and my taxes and you're right on your neighbors and and my ... and\nUh the growers in Mexico\nThat do quite well Julie one thing I Want to bring up as we recently did something really fun or we might what the diamond backs and a\nA young young lady maim madly in another Morgan or I Believe a fellow named David David on the chef named Steve who is over all the restaurants there it's a diamond direct stadium as well as the sun's than we're doing a a a\nA special variety a chili just for them to Austin and all the ... of the five oh five flagship company or my friend Rob Hall in this kind of hidden that up and the and and our our catch to it is it's Arizona bread Arizona grown ... go\nArizona to the bone you know and and and and that's you know we're excited about that we were in the stadium just the two weeks ago two weekends ago\nAnd it was it was just a all my life New Mexico has carried the name of chili and and and and that's great we're thankful for them I don't want to in any way say we're not you know but it's fun to bring up an Arizona we're at Arizona grown Arizona product that will\nBe for us Arizona's and so hopefully by a by next season you will be able to buy a D backs also with the Arizona Chilean bread right here and coaches count and it was called again we will be called the ... ...\nFive ... five five I don't know if any of your all

us there's more to thanks for having me I really appreciate it\nAnd give me that title again\nIt's not easy [laughter] it's either a noble energy technical specialists and could only ask him technical questions so easy ones\nSo with that said\nThere's nothing in there that says rate select her [laughter]\nI Do have ten years of experience working with rates working with ... bills working with energy efficiency\nFor the longest time my job was to ensure everyone paid the utility as little as possible and use as little energy as possible you you're fairly new to the yes but again in the industry for you up at a silver springs go up yeah OK and he even knew\nWhat right by Mr curry was [laughter] how you said your your job is to get them to use as little as possible in that area electricity for pumping water vital yeah water in his area is a guy they might be in a non expansion area I Can't remember but water\nWater for fighting whiskey for drinking right that's right that's right well we do get a lot we do share a lot of information about a technique\nThat of of a good friend of mine I'm a people called me the father of super cooler but I'm not I'm I'm the steps on a street cat\nIs the father of super cool like they were just a voice for hours the voice for it um he convinced me early on ours is almost Twenty years ago or when the when the time of day plans first began to get introduced\nHe's the roses I I think it has something figured out he says uh\nIf you have a fairly energy efficient home\nWe can\nConsume a lot of power off peak\nFor one for the price\nThoroughly store it\nIn the building and the furniture and appliances and the\nDraperies and the clothes in the closet and get our homes comfortable off peak and when that aren't peak period hits let's just ask her house to go to sleep and wake back up\nWhen the on peak off again brilliant\nSo we introduced this cause so I tested it at my house\nAnd at that point I still had six kids at home and\nAnd my kids never lived at home without for their friends [laughter] so it was like Grand Central station fifty people split in the pool in and out the doors you know I I could scream and yell about closing their doors in August but it wasn't a demand a good [laughter] I I Would have just lost about ...\nSo we started experimenting and testing this super cooling technique shifting\nAs much power consumption off peak as possible and I got criticized early that's the most selfish greedy thing you could do and my point is you know it's probably one of the most green things I can do because I'm now giving the information back to the power suppliers that hey I you you can ignore me at peak yep\nAnd that's what utilities have to build for is picking restructure peak demand so you're helping out the peak is what drives that next power plant construction\nBigger conductors more are\nJust more juice on the system so the more we can cut off that peak and the utility companies are becoming a little bit more aggressive about this over the last I Want to say the last Twenty years\nI checked with us the U.S are yesterday because I put myself on the peak demand program a free T are all owned a house in three or four days and then I'm going to be on that rate and\nSo I wanted to be able to talk to talk and walk the walk and I just think it's it's it's a good thing for everyone to go to go to\nI Do believe that in ... you have to opt out of a ... a teal you program now but I I'm not a hundred percent sure I I just did some reading on that earlier and I wasn't able to check with the CS are so check with your local a\nCustomer service rep and whatever utility Iran and see if that will work for you see if he has a nice website that covers a lot of information\nUh and so easily they have the gamble now the couple it is well it is I was on it last night for a little a little off\nThe one of the things I Want to talk about how how big the customer base the all have [noise] so we've got about four hundred and Seventeen thousand customers for T. P. and y'all are primarily Tucson metro Tucson metro and we go down south near a\nGreen valley Kobe up and around ... there's some have snakes around will go down a cut in Santa Cruz county um\nMaybe touching a little bit of coaches county okay\nAll right and so of those four hundred thousand customers\nHow many are on a time of day do you know so as of two thousand Seventeen there were about ten thousand\nOut of four hundred thousand yeah yeah or on time of day yeah\nThat's disgraceful\nI Know that um the information I got was from a website and it said that that's how many we had in two thousand Seventeen while I think that they're they their market and marketing get aggressively or idle they'll we'll see\nFolks I if if you live in a Mosley well built home\nAnd you can push your power consumption\nOff peak you can save money I think so\nIntimately familiar with the peace power structure but\nHouse three thousand square feet with an air conditioned garage I can\nBe at eight cents a kilowatt\nAnd they're just they're there's hardly anything you could do at your home to save more money than that and it's just one be on the white rate plan yeah to\nBe smart about how and when you consume power yet and you're going to save money yeah they'll save a lot of money but\nOn the corollary to that if you don't plan if you did oh you're going to get hurt it's going to be painful it is and that's what that's why three hundred and Ninety thousand of your four hundred thousand customers\nHave jumped for its army used they've got a little bit of a fear of the ... but I think with with programmable thermostats making that jumped into whether you can\nReach them with your ... your smartphone or a\nI think appliances or going that way I think it's just it it should be the wave of the future it is and if you want to be a green energy consumer you will go to the time of use and you will move your power consumption too off peak and I use as much or more power\nI just use it a different time a day and my bill is about thirty percent lower than his bill\nYou can work harder you can wear smart\nYou're working smarter at that folks were here this morning it rose you on the house broadcasting live from the Tucson convention center for the southern Arizona home builders association the show opens at ten we have open the doors early at nine those of you that requested early tickets we do have someone at\nThe door it is on the south side of the building the far east end of the ah ah loading rap\nWe're all the food trucks are generally lined up parking parking lot be come all the way down the ramp to the last door on the east end of the convention center that east into that loaded grab and we've got your tickets for you that you can also join on air borne triple eight seven six seven for three four eight that's one triple a rosy for you\nText questions to Fort one one nine to three and a email info arrows the on the house dot com where again live at the Tucson convention center\nFor the ... show folks if you all are in a car show\nYou cover in your book will retain the value of your home and do the easy to convert back to a swimming pool\n... fool covers it far too old to three to twenty four thirty\nAnd five two to three to twenty four thirty for\nOr of the three one six five three zero\nHere honey happy anniversary which says\nIt's not our anniversary or anniversaries in may remember maybe yes and maybe no\nYou're my work wife too and it's a lion's roofing twenty fifth anniversary that's right twenty five years wow we really have so much to be grateful for go head open your gift\nCheck to the Arizona animal welfare league for a hundred dollars I thought we should instead give back to the community that has supported us all these years and I know you love those four legged babies what a\nGreat idea let's expand on this let's give a gift of\nOne hundred dollars for every roof purchased throughout this year to one of our four designated charities I Love you my work wife I liked the way you think and you're still my sweet and salty get very sexy work how the work and life if you want to learn more about or give back to the community program\nGo to L.

mortgage interest rates are the story of the day as mortgages will cost you about twenty five percent more than they would have six months ago\nEven with the increased rates are still fantastic buyers are racing to buy homes before interest rates get out of control creating a red hot seller's market have you been considering moving up we're downsizing to a different tone\nNow is the perfect time to cash in on this pillars market and buy another place before interest rates get even higher called John today for a zero three seven eight sixty seven hundred\nTo get a free estimate of just how much virus will pay for your home in this fantastic market now is also a great time for landlords to sell rental homes but they'd been hanging onto since the crash home prices are above the peak and there is a severe shortage of home inventory\nValley wide typically we would expect\nOne point six percent of all homes to be for sale but right now less than one percent actually are\nThis shortage combined with red hot buyers racing to beat the interest rate increases is causing bidding more than increased home prices potential sellers who have been waiting for home values to return are likely to catch on soon\nSo John is recommending that potential sellers strongly considering lifting their home during the summer selling things than before the market is flooded with new lifting\nA free no

kinda spreading the load yeah that that resources are I'm expanding every day I'm ways of controlling them within your house and a\nManipulated them to use less electricity or growing every day so it's not just the\nUtility that well we've done it that way for Thirty years we've got to be a pretty pretty mobile pretty out there\nSo we were talking a little bit of both the manufacturing of power y'all are here at the home show at the Tucson convention center the show opens at ten today\nIt's open today and tomorrow y'all are giving away shade trees yes one of the things that goes a long way in cutting your cooling bills yeah cut down on insulation in your house if you plant in the right spot at well\nSo what is the program for given those trees away so I was up in the hall earlier today I saw you had a pretty big supply of yeah I think they have six hundred trees and get a princess because group has given away a six hundred of them\nIf you're ... customers to come up a\nEnter your information and spin it will and that will determine what kind of tree that you can you can get I Believe there are also given at least in LA the lights and cat and they have plenty of information there okay so the shade is critical in cutting your summer cooling bills\nA deciduous tree would also be great planted in the right strategic location for a year round advantages yeah yeah if uh if it

to some of the big box stores go get discounted eh ladies um\nDentist the big box stores yep and then you'll have a smart thermostat rebate program yeah\nThere's a certain\nAmount of money that is set aside and until that money is a depleted uh\nThey're giving away discount it they're or they're not given away but there's a a discount that apply to a thermostat if you get a smart thermostat\nLet's go to your website T. E. P. dot com and go to that energy calculator I find that very fast it helps people really understand you know all people not all people care about is when they throw the switch light comes ... right [noise]\nThey've been trained to just you know it it's like any more people think that their life all this park out if they flip a switch in a life not on energy says that reliable\nAbsolutely when the timer clicks to go the water heater comes on where you could still on the swimming pool up comes in ... so in that energy calculator what could a home or what kind of exercises are available in there for them to kind of get a picture of of how they're buying power so it will ask you\nA several things about your home\nWhat the inflation of last or how old is it um\nWhat appliance you have in their how many people are going to be in there how do you hate your home on equal your almighty a cook and\nThen it'll ask you how many appliances you have and it will give you a rough estimate of what your energy usage could be\nUm and it's it's all in theory right but then when you put it in practice it it depends on how you\nCan't compare that to the bills you're getting yeah and say okay well maybe there's some maybe some things that I can work on and then you go into the subsidy and rebate program the job I got to take a look at some of the asset you have available there of or even sometimes\nPay attention to your home it's telling you things you may not even know if you're taking a shower and your shower is not the hot water not laughing the entire shower it means you probably got\nYou have a a water heater issue and rather than waiting for your utility bill to show up in shock you you can act on that now or using an app we talked about technology earlier go on the map and see what your daily usage is and if it's out of whack 'em\nYou know be proactive on it I call it the utilities see if there's something going on there's probably nothing going on with your meter but they may have a professional can come out or can talk to you on the phone and tell you how to use less electricity or to to shift that electricity\nThat we we were talking about the ... the um practice of thermal storage earlier and moving your on peak purchase two off peak or it doesn't work well\nNineteen Ninety four double murder of the strange life Nicole Brown Simpson's and her friend Ronald Goldman and they have a two hundred and sixty two days [noise]\nDo with known as a nation in mind\nWas running from trouble and the jails are doing that in mind the [noise]\nFairly good at and the voter man\nA new law picking country music mainland songs in title are you going to dump a map and you know I'm just surprised there's so many songs that have reference Tucson I asked for oh yeah plenty I'm ...

E. pi we talk a lot about how people can cut their in particular there's summer cooling bills by easier\nAnd the technique or and or a strategy\nCalled super cool it and we\nWe have fine tuned it for a PS because that's all the properties I own or in a PS zone so I've got several\nWays I can model the plan and and and sort the information and outsmart the supplier so to speak to get my bill as well as I can and we don't have\nThat I'm paying over nine cents a kilowatt for and I didn't spend a lot of money doing anything other than just making sure I was on the right plan and energy management computer and bought a being\nAs low as you can get and people say oh boy your house must be hot well let me tell you something folks\nAt my house the temperature is set at sixty eight degrees through the middle of the summer\nMy wife wears a little light show in and around the house almost all day long and I'm Still at on her nine cents my three thousand square foot home which is in a big home it's just three bedroom two bath\nBills this year we're under three hundred and twenty five bucks okay so I'm consuming about thirty six thirty eight hundred K W\nI'm doing at about nine cents a kilowatt and that's in the peak of the summer my bills I'm dual energy so we cook with natural gas we heat with natural gas with barbecue with actual gas my summer electric bills\nDrop through the floor I mean they're like they're like Seventy bucks a month or nothing [noise] so\nWe're getting inundated roaming\nWith information about prop one twenty seven\nWhat she how should we vote for one twenty seven now I Know it makes you nervous and I know it makes your mom nervous anytime ... goes to politics\nI'd like to just give up my personal cell number so I could just tell everybody how to vote on everything on the ballot would that be OK [laughter] listen folks when it comes to prop one twenty seven which is it is the renewal energy standards proposition okay\nThis is written by somebody that has an agenda we currently supply about eight percent of the grid with renewable energy and it's twenty let's just call it twenty Nineteen okay we're just a couple of months away they want us to do that\nThey want us to increase from eight percent\nTwo fifty percent\nIn what timeframe twelve years [noise]\nLike that's doable that's doable we can do that\nBut they want to do it and here's the scary part they want to do it and this was written in to the proposition one one it's a constitutional amendment so that makes me nervous anytime they want to amend the constitution then I start getting a microscope out and I look at every single word okay\nAnd there are a couple of propositions this year the constitutional amendment this isn't the only one\nSo I'm looking at the

enough to get your winter rye grass to to germinate and establish\nProbably haven't needed water anything should not probably you should you don't you haven't had to\nDid you plant winter lawn I Know you've done a lot of American over an artificial turf run his artificial my back is still I mean I'm going to keep regular grass and I have not done it yet\nI kind of made a vow of this year and of course this was the year you should have put it in earlier [laughter] but the last you know for ten or Fifteen Twenty years it stayed warm so long I thought you know I'm not even gonna do it till last weekend 'til Halloween weekend\nI should try and do the front yard so it was up an established by Halloween 'cause kids walk across that mhm\nWell that's not an issue anymore so the backyard I Will do next weekend\nI always have a plan\nAnd it revolves around the kid's birthday to do a lot of our parties outside and riding lawn and right we've got a may birthday so I Try and keep the rye green until okay a pad member that has the birthday and then we've got another birthday in September so we try and make sure we've got\n... you know we we don't shut the water after the Bermuda too early yeah\n[noise] I I haven't water that lawn\nIn six weeks and it's greener than it was any point of this summer when I was like every other day that that's the other thing that's frustrating to as you work hard all summer trying to get your laundry recover from the transition from rug rats and finally about\nThe end of September it's awesome looking their Bermuda just beautiful and it's not growing that much you don't even have to mow is green slush doesn't grow that much don't have to water it much like why go over why go scout but I'm going to wait and you know if if people that are listening are worried about\nBeing too late to oversee no not at all I mean you can you could technically do it all winter it once we get really cold we started getting frost in the morning or that cold\nIt can be pretty slow to germinate but you can still get it to germinate I'm not advocating you wait till I figure a way that long you might as well just not do is what I'm\nI think actually early November late late October early November is probably the best time to do it anymore because what happens invariably\nPeople scouts or Bermuda\nAnd they plan through Congress with the Bermuda doesn't stay dormant\nIt grows back especially with all this rain so yeah that rug rats came out great\nBut it's still warm enough the room you just wanting to grow so it can be it grows back up and kind of mixes in with the ride grass then what happens when we do get that first frost all to Bermuda does go dormant and you look out and go oh\nYeah I've got this all whole bunch of brown stuff in my law on the other thing that we do is we really stress that Bermuda grass lawn by making it by cutting that short in introducing this competitor right in right on top of it the shades it out crowds at out takes and nutrition away from it\nBefore it's wanting to go dormant on the other end of that when it comes time to transition we've had this long that's been stressed out and now it's trying to recover and come back\nIn crowd this competitor out in a struggle to do that so I think that that too early over seeding in the fall contributes to our struggles with transition late in the spring and early summer\nSo if you haven't done it it's not too late but and you'd mentioned all winter long but what I notice is\nIt's hard to find if you wait too long well you might want to buy the seat absolutely good point if you wait too long I mean you know eventually they quit bringing an end quit straw shocking that um you can't they don't carry rug rats down here in the valley all win\nYou know through the end of the spring they want to be out so not a bad idea to go get the seed have it on hand and I always get a little extra because you're going to house spots that don't come up the way you want him to spots maybe or maybe something happens during the year the lawn you got a water break or water thing you've got to dig up\nKind of nice to have five or ten pounds or ride grass seed\nYou know keep it dry keep it out of the ... you know out of the moisture in if you don't ever use it use it next fall and keep ten pounds back on to that seat it doesn't go bad unless it gets wet but uh not a bad idea to have a few extra pounds around\nLet's guitar calls we've got 'em lined up at one triple eight seven six seven for three four eight that's when ... rosy for you starting with Jack welcome to the program\nHey well thank you guys are you taking my call um I have a youthful live oak tree in my front yard that wonderful shade and I love the tree the problem with it is it has a\nDroppings I guess now I got probably close to a hundred little many trees growing underneath that are in Iraq and the grass is well\nI'm trying to figure out how to get rid of those things without killing everything else around that\nWell you can you know obviously you can pull them\nUm that that's probably the safest solution to that um if they are seedlings if you're getting them from acorns dropping off the oak tree and their sprouting you could kill them with you know just just go up to each little individual one with\nA little round up and just take a paintbrush and just gathered on each one of them full strength\nUm if they're coming off the root system right at the base of the tree off the trunk you know I wouldn't do that because then there's potentially damaging\nYou know the main tree but if you've just got seedlings coming up and you're very careful you just take I just take a a bottle of full strength glass is eight and a little like a little hobby paintbrush\nAnd just dabbled on the news is ... ... you just don't want to go spraying doesn't just wasting the product if you get it on the ground anyway it doesn't really hurt that ... anything but just to be environmentally safe and to be careful and then I get it where you don't want to get a gist dabbled on there and that should take\nCare of it perfect thanks so much I appreciate it You're welcome we appreciate the call

Hartford\nAbout anything or your landscape gardening irrigation Theresa welcome to the program how may we help you\nAnd thank you um I live in dark finance and on the north side of my house the whole side of the north side acted out at ten by twenty area a year ago April when I had moved in I planted some thought I got from\nHome Depot was flying over the last fall wet or dry grass that was my next summer the grass came back but I Do have a pack so it was a little catchy when I guess when she does on the on the grass\nOn that later on this summer it just died and happened that happens the day it's total shit from my house\nSo I'm trying to figure out your age is that grass can even come back is right now I have this tiny little bits of regular Bermuda grass just died off I don't know if I could plant back here to help it come back next year for the regular grass there should just overseas with dry again\nAnd it my grass not going to come back here in the summer\n[noise] yeah I I don't think your grass is coming back I think what really happened is your Bermuda never really did come back in ... in about mid summer when the monsoons kicked in and the nighttime temperatures didn't cool off what you had there was probably mostly ride grass and it finally died\nA minute shady so it's going to hang on longer the Bermuda just not going to do well because of shady so the rug rats dominates it it's stays alive all summer until we get you know warm temperatures at night\nI'm so couple of ideas for you one would be I Would go ahead and plan a rug rats lawn\nAnd enjoy it and try and keep it alive probably as long as you can you could supplement that with ... next spring I Would I Would do it\nEarlier march April I wouldn't wait till may or June ... doesn't like hot weather really either it's more heat tolerant\nThan ... than Iraq grasses um but you'd want to probably you could actually so it with the rug rats and mix it in if you want it to 'em or you could wait until like ... spring and and do it then make just throw it in with Iraq grass\nBut regardless of what you do I think that the Bermuda\nThis is just sounds like us to shady and it's just not going to\nWork All right ...\nThank you so much You're welcome we appreciate the call has to be clear line that opens the line for you one triple eight seven six seven for three four eight that's AAA rosy for you Jackie welcome to the program\nIt mining um I have a question about in Oakland deal we had one that was about that I get ten to twelve years old\nAnd um every spraying it would leave out beautifully it last spring um about a quarter of it became did not leave out the rest of the plant dead and then um I don't know what was happening and can you tell me what what killed in Oakland deal\n[noise]\nHard to say um you know it could be just drought related to water it at all\nUm if it's really they really really hot and dry didn't have a a minefield we got a lot of rain we got we got plenty of water all we've got a thick feather Okla Theo that receive the same amount of water so I Know they were doing All right\nYeah and if it's going to say if it's not least out right now it probably isn't gonna I mean the ... and ...\nBeautiful what happened was when the ... the one of the last stories that we've got um we got up in the morning and um it it it completely shared off at ground level the roots didn't that route it this year it off at ground level and the whole thing just wound up collapsing okay well\nYou know it sounds like the one of the things that could have caused that is if it originally was planted maybe too deep in the ground\nAnd in soil got up higher on the the canes than it should have it's possible that it could have rotted overtime and causing those gains to die and then like I said when you got a strong wind it just they just fell over\nThat that would be my best guess is that something\nLike that would have taken ten twelve years for that the average\nPossible yeah yeah it's possible I\nI don't I don't have another I don't really have another good option a solution for you other than you know quite frankly in in nature some things just die and it just causes a natural thing once it's started dying other tissue around it might have continued to\nAh to rot or go away or or be damaged and and that just kind of kept spreading but it sounds to me perhaps like a like maybe a ... ... when it when it blew over what did the ... would\nLook like when you picked up the canes where it was connected to the to the base of the root\nAnd they were driving stamped it we're not green inside or anything\nYou know what is it kinda hollowed out on the inside was it do you even remember\nWhat it was you know I I Want to say that they would on the inside but it just dried out yeah\nI you know don't really know that I could tell you exactly what happened\nBut ... does seem to be a pretty hard slant to\nUh uh one of the harder plants to really care and manage for well what's ... bullet proof you know you don't have to do anything to them I'm trying to get new ones established and that's part of just how they're marketed in sold yes or a guy goes to probably Texas digs them up\nHowever long it takes to fill a truckload of um dug up puts them on a big flatbed truck drives them across the desert\nStops at various nurseries in town download and they just stack them up and sell them well that still works in some cases in fact you see old ranch is that ... offenses were these would break the canes off stick them in the ground and and they start growing but I think the biggest problem is just the fact\nThat they've been out of the soil we've ... we've remove most of the root system\nAnd uh and they haven't been\nCaring for the best and they'd be hydrate and they just don't they aren't able to reestablish themselves a lot of those native plants to they will\nSeem to have a way to manage the water and you know they might die off or a limb might die Ira and they put a new sprout on no that's exactly that's exactly right so under stress they survive by just shutting down\nI I Need to have rosy come just with his chain so I've got to where we probably have I had done account but there's a couple of dozen native\nA mosquito ... he's on the property that ah you know just to have grown there and two of 'em\nI've I've gone to cut down a couple of times and I'm All right this thing's finally debt we get a rain like to send an explosion [laughter] yeah it's a bit there in a horrible spot known they need to get\nI mean they're not they're not as slow as a lot of people want to make them out to be unnecessarily but a lot of times are better stronger\nMore durable trees are a little slower growing a lot of times the reason that ... break and blow over and have the problems they have is they grow too fast or we you know we we stimulate them to grow too fast water them too much we push them\nI'm so I'd still not talk you out of a pistachios maybe you want to start a little bigger than than than you would with some other type of tree but it's a heck of a tree live oak same way not not terribly slow not the fastest\nGreat sturdy tree I Love um Chinese film\nUm those those are probably my three favorites right there Chinese um red push stash in live oaks and ... the live oaks evergreen the red push is to sit on my than than the ... the elm is the semi deciduous as well yeah so it's just a matter\nThen at that point and decided he want winter shade as well or do you want that to open up for a little warmth and the correct the cooler I won't say cold in Arizona and I know that yeah the cooler\nMonths right as we're talking through planting those trees how do you get started on on trees and shrubs\nWell right now the reason is such a great time to plant is that you know the soil is is still relatively warm\nAnd the Arabs cooling in the days are getting shorter\nSo you can you can plan a plant in the roots are going to continue to grow because that it's almost like an incubator the soils warm but you won't get a lot of stress on the foliage because it's not hot there not transpiring so much\nSo you get this condition whether the plant is routine and establishing itself without putting on a lot of growth\nA on a lot of new foliage a lot of thing and it it's cooler you know how to water them as much it's just a lot easier to transplant instead of it when it's a hundred degrees out and you're having to water 'em twice a day or you know every day and you miss one and the plant Wilson stresses and get some sun burn on it\nAnd kind of goes backwards a little bit Anya\nThis time of year you want and then what will happen is as it continues to cool the plant will leave in slow down or stop routine the soil will will be cool enough and it looked like the plant just sitting there all winter and come spring\nInstead of trying to plan a new plant then we've got a plant that's already rooted in established at least underground and the the new growth just explodes so it's it's virtually like gaining a whole year by planting three or four months ahead of time\nWhen we're digging that whole how far past the ... he's talking about the biggest one\nI don't you realize how can you can actually buy one if he wants to but you know that's fine so what what you wider is better and wider you know I don't know that you go to why'd\nYou certainly want to go wide enough that you can get\nThe the container in the ground and then get the container off you know ... too tight you're not going to be able to get the the box offer or the container that it's in we certainly don't want to go any deeper and maybe not even quite as deep it's better for the plant to be a little shallower so that you ... you have kind of a crown\nSo to speak and certainly where the what we call the route flare or the Trump comes down and then there should be a little bit of a flare out where it meets the soil that needs to be or finished grade\nOkay so that needs to stay up at least finished our little higher I get to be a little higher because invariably soil settles or sinks a little bit then it doesn't you know soil around it doesn't cave in on it and that gives you a good area to put a couple of inches a mole then you can ... yes if you get a little higher than you can you can mulch around it\nWhich I think is critical especially during the summer months uh don't put the landscape rock right up against the trunk of the tree hold it back put some bark mall shredded\nBark something organic around it um you know even a you know shameless plug but Hickman compost around it\nOr something to to help cool the roots hold moisture it'll control weeds like John Eisenhower was talking about mulching and composting last week on the show and it it does exactly all of that so controls weeds stabilizes the moisture even the moisture out\nAnd reduces the stress that you have sometimes in the summer with a plant getting overheated or transpiring and losing too much moisture\nAnd your quickly talking about this is the time to save water it takes a lot less water to get an established right or if you plan to do this\nSpring and it's going into the heat season you're in a all this additional water not ordering relentlessly a Saturn dealership help it survive that's correct\nA better establish tree is it going to require as much water to keep it living through the summer or something you just planted going into not to say we can't do it not to say it doesn't happen and we there's people in ... landscape cruise construction buildings that have to play it when they have to you know but\nIf you have your choice you your whole motor and you're thinking about planting\nSome stuff coming up and you can do it the next couple of months are the best\nThey are the best and it's a beautiful time to be out there anyway up so this is what brings us to Arizona I was ... certainly rather be digging holes from now through February as opposed to march April May and June when you're just\nSweating lock a dog out there trying to get holes Doug so you know I was still people if if it's comfortable for you the plants are going to love it [laughter] very true very true and you're\nA big proponent of not ness of starting with a smaller tree as opposed to trying to put in a norm is one well if you could afford it heck yeah I Do it but you know\nPush comes to shove this especially if budget things grow a lot faster once you get 'em in the ground [noise] then they grow and the nurturing those containers [noise] so [noise] sometimes it's you know [noise] cut a false economy just think you got to really [noise]\n\n\nI don't need to tell you how

that are in the twenty thousand dollars now it's worth the investment and long term for the comfort of the home but I mean who who's got twenty Jim yeah twenty thousand dollars later on front air conditioning\nCenter right now [laughter] [laughter] I Wish I did [laughter]\nOh man and and if you had twenty thousand laying around is air conditioning the first thing you think I'm going to spend it on\n... no no but if you're a conditioning went out today you'd find twenty thousand [laughter] how does it get it out [laughter] a shaken Bush's should check into money treat us right [laughter] how are we going to get this replaced so it's\nIt's a way we can take did technology and\nHome maintenance emergent together uh and bring it to the Arizona homeowner so we're really excited about it right now we're talking about a whole maintenance item we've ... brought a gym and from about blind cleaning you are really a a kind of a\nOne of a kind it's not like a when you go to the register contractors website and you select air conditioning\nYou get thousands of air conditioning contractor correct you're such a specialty unit a licensing this and performance does a little bit about your specialty and then we'll walk through what homeowners can do\nA for their the maintenance of their window treatments\nBecause that's it doesn't seem like it that's a big ticket\nYes it is a big ticket out in um my company started in Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd what happened was that I walked into hunted Douglas and to get a part to fix for customer and the gentleman told me there that are on A Douglas just put the navy behind a school that people want to be a professional in this business and I so\nAnd ah he gave me the information and then two weeks I was in quarter learning how to hold\nA training for hunting Douglas window coughing so I've been going to school every since then because it does have new products come out every year so somebody have to know how to restore the bat close to the original\nCarla and this is one of those services that are and and as it relates to maintenance that if you maintain your window treatments\n...\nYou're you're at a fraction of replacement costs\nDefinitely definitely is a is a big savings and a half of them are restored than buying a new Juno which a lot of people spend a lot of money and they want to know how they can have a professional restore and that's what we do\nIt's not unrealistic either to ... to to see a home where they spent more on the treatments than they did the actual windows themselves correct\n[laughter] yes uh some of the windows or a can cost up to three thousand dollars or more and uh we have restored those type of when the companies had been up over ten to Fifteen\nYears and those three thousand dollar window treatments are covering an eight eighty eight hundred dollar window [laughter]\n[laughter]\nWe we by the window so we can see out and we put sunscreens on the outside to keep coming out that we put ... treatments on the inside for privacy at night to closer for decorative reasons or whatever right windows inexpensive function of the home\nYes yes they are and are they are a good energy efficient to ah when you buy a type of window coverings on your home\nSo looking at a sitting in my kitchen right now civil my cup of coffee just got done with breakfast and I'm procrastinating getting up to\nDo dishes because it's such a beautiful morning I'm trying to decide what I'm going to tackle around the house and I'm looking out my window on my eyes drift to the says whatever window treatment of have on the interior what what am I looking for an end preventative maintenance\nWell first thing a a lover ladies they be doing exactly what you're saying I Want to have gas coming in and then they look at that when the covers and he said oh my God my window companies is dirty you know then they go to\n\nMakes a lot of sense I mean you want to be able to have that privacy at night and not have people look in in the home and\n\nThere's so many things [laughter] you can say is that everybody would just take for granted that are there right take those off and see how long you're going to be comfortable with that grows you're to the outside world when you're trying to live in your home and and feeling constantly vulnerable to anyone from outside seeing what's happening on the interior\nThat becomes a pretty that was in our priority list pretty quick being able to have our privacy correct\nCorrect or most of their homes today is moving out what the many blondes at today you have a more fabric blinds uh be made for winners and home and they are energy of fish and a lot of people is going to go into um\nRoller shades and at home because they are energy efficient now but you know how to have a clean somebody has to be an expert on it because you can ruin a real fast\nAnd in need cleaning industry\nI'm going to mirror this to\nAir ducts there are people that will come and say hey you need to get your air ducts clean twice a year spring and that really doesn't do anything you have to get in and clean the condensing coil on the air conditioning unit itself and when you do that and clean the inside of your duck works\nYou don't have to do this but every seven to ten years I'm going to assume in the blank cleaning you could pay somebody to come and do a blow a good job or get it done per professionally the right way and this the last a lot longer and maintain the value in that fabric in that\nColor yes uh I think I said it before the average person and a Arizona has their window coverings clean every five years because we are more outside society and traveling and going all different places\nBut I don't look at a temperature right now who's windows and doors and left open and correct them and they had in their home right now [laughter] especially\nWhen when I have a monsoon season when the ... come across it brings all that Dustin and dust mites at comes all into\nA ... that's the only time women everybody's cooped up into the home but most of the time everybody's out so they actually don't think about having the blinds or window coffees a clean then until they see the dust on them or they have a gas coming in\nAnd how often should they be clean and\nWell they should be clean every two years\nBut the cost to having them clean law customers rather wait to five years and they don't uh do they just don't I haven't had anybody\nUh since I've been in business with twenty three years to come and have them clean every two years we just did a gentleman's house\nThat uh he hadn't cleaned five years ago and uh they look just like brand new again 'cause we save their money because if you pay that that that today's price for him it'd be two times as much for\n... for the new for the new one correct so you're cleaning price hasn't doubled and five years [laughter]\nI Know you might we should our [laughter] that's true but no I had no ...\nAnd if you called hunter Douglas 'cause you've got a broken line or you're trying to get something fixed on it they\nJust turned around and send them to you\n... they tell the customer the call us and we get a lot of referrals from how does this recall all over the state for them\nAnd that's really one of the premier names in the window treatment it's\nYes a hundred Douglas is the premier window problems of the world and\nJim somebody could reach you you can find them that rosy on the house dot com and the cleaning section in the blind section window treatments section it's one of those categories that we don't like to\nHave fifty million categories to pick from from rosy on the house but we also have to think like a consumer some people think blind some people think

responsibility of the homeowner the one that's going to be living in it to make that decision for you or you turn it over to your interior\nDesigner and just go with what they suggest as well but color selection\nAgain you don't appreciate it till you see a bad job and there's a ... an example of a home that off of its ... uh like ninth ... avenue and thunder bird call amount huh well [laughter]\nIt was it was a [laughter]\nA bad situation for him and it it shouldn't be the color of your home really shouldn't be what breaks relationships with your neighbors but they were on a limited budget this paint was available the home really needed it and it turned out to be like\nBig bird yellow when it was done and it created a lot of tension with his neighbors because he didn't even like the color of the home but he needed it for the\nA ... to protect\nThe surfaces of his home and he couldn't afford anything else so for a number of years it was you know the big bird home\nThat became a neighbor sore and amazingly enough when you're looking at location of somebody was looking for that location but didn't like this they want to live next to this orange home it could create\nA more of a difficult situation which was one of the reasons age always were created to avoid situations like that but\nYou know who I also don't want to be told what color realms I have to live in either so\nDon't write and done wrong\nIt's easy to not appreciate the amount of work and effort that it really takes to do it right\nI have a home in my neighborhood and stuff for evening Ron morning run I should say and a lady on the corner was getting ready to paint her house so it's going nice\nAbout a day later I I I pass by there\nAnd I'm not kidding it looks like cornbread it's the color of corn bread and so I nickname if the cornbread house and well it doesn't look bad Mm yellows again one of those colors that you get it wrong you're going to be pretty bad you know be pretty disappointed\nAnd the next year of your home is completely different than the interior of her home in the environment that you're spending more time it\nDo you spend more time outside or inside maybe it didn't bother cornbread lady or big bird guy 'cause they were more inside people does the people on the outside the home that had to deal with that color selection versus what's on the interior of the home\nAre we at a I'm going to these rosy on this one he had picked a color\nThat they thought was going to be a very nice yellow it turned out to be more like at LSU goals which I think may have been the intention to begin with you know I I'm going to agree with you on that it was in the master bedroom a new ... trying to surprise Jennifer did this while she was gone on a trip\nAnd came back to an el issue gold bedroom that\nWas that way for a number of years because\nWhat I was ... you don't have any time to repaint it right but\nThe the L issues colors are gold and purple so this was this was more of a yellow color yellowish color than not so much gold color [noise] well I wouldn't say that you know like a a gold bars\nYeah no it it was more close el issue or yellow but a recall purple and gold is just a habit yeah the\nBut the amount of disruption on the interior of the the what it takes to execute a paint job properly the disruption of creates in your daily life especially in your bedroom they didn't have time to re drape everything put the drop costs back down mascot\nProtect do the trend do rolling move the furniture you know\nThe more we can

twice as ... waving it you get up close with a magnifying glass and there's little tidbits and pockets\nOr that as a pain trying there's voids that are left and you don't see them on a new paint because at new paint looks so good compared to what you're going over\nUntil you've had time to living in a few days a few weeks a few months and you start to see these imperfections so being able to control and move freely and work correctly is a big part of it it it very disrupting internal process to your daily\nLiving and the amount of prep work in the ... and the joints in that the amount of time between applying you're talking where you're meeting too dissimilar materials like uh your windows your doors your trend and removing that pain or the tape from the paint so it doesn't feel it is\nVery precise process\nYou get done with that you think how does somebody make a living at this because you don't want to paint again for the rest of your life [laughter] and the crew that just

bedroom white and the first to spring sunlight that comes through the bedroom when I open up the windows that looks really nice boy at six in the morning it feels like it's ten in the morning it was so bright so I decided\nLet's not make it so why so I found a sheet of blue painted the bedroom blue just the walls not the ceiling or anything like that and that actually worked very well in other words folks I got lucky 'cause I have no idea when it comes to interior design and decorating I just kind of look and take a shot at it so I got very lucky on that one\nI picked a color one shade off one shade off what\nThe interior designer said here's what you want and it was so bright color was Colorado Ross and I was using it for an accident\nOn the middle a pantry and the entering hallways on each side of the house I did one shake because I thought this is too bright it's too hard I'm going to go one shade back to reduce just how bold this color is\nIt looked so bad I spent another five hundred dollars to go get enough pain to do the to go right over the new paint yeah 'cause I I didn't trust a trust the color will but it looks so bad just one shade it's amazing what difference I

D Andrea have you on the eighth in Andrea's fault the Andrea how does one become a CPS agent\nOkay I'm not an agent ... yeah and that's it makes for good radio\nSure I supervised the program I here in Phoenix I had a team of five in home color consultants for sure Williams and we cover Phoenix and the greater valley providing this valuable service\nAnd the supervisor ... supervising these four or five people five five and they drive to somebody's home so\nAre they bring in color wheels with them or they bring in a did did they go through a an eye color checked test with the homeowners first [laughter] or do you see these different types of shades what's daily life\nA ... okay so the homeowners come to the store and of course they're searching for their best and\nBeautiful color that are going to paint their space and we offer this service in the store and they decide to purchase the appointment\nAnd then the color consultant gets that appointment and I that's what we call a pre call and verifies with them what their project is what they're a style maybe what their color or likes dislikes are\nAnd we prepare for the appointment that way uh and then the day on the appointment when we arrived we hit the door renting we know what they're looking for as a consultant ... every time I hit the door I start seizing up the tile the sofa\nThat drapes the light their comments about whether they wanted it ... or they wanted it bride and energetic\nAnd you start to get a picture of what they were saying on the phone and what your possibilities are in that space and from there you continue to question your customer were always there to please the customer and find the style and colors they want it's not about what we think\nIs you know the best design style we may like a farmhouse modern and they may like a rustic\nChateau luck so we always work with the client to make sure that we're achieving the results they're looking for so when we find all those details we start polling colors we'll show color in context\nAnd worked the appointment from there\nAnd this really fascinates\nMe I'm very task driven person and I can't imagine being in a job where my final task is to make you make a decision hound is I I Would feel like how I I don't know how to complete that task\nWill you complete the task because you're gathering information on the recall\nAnd you're gathering information right when you hit the door as the as the consultant and you're listening or you have the right questions because we're trained and were professionals so we have the right questions to get the answers we need to help find that best neutral flow color um [noise]\nIt's not that it can be with difficult with certain clients who really have that angel devil sitting on their a shoulder and they just start indecisive\nBut I Would say Ninety eight percent of the people really want a color confirmation they may have started the process themselves and they don't have anyone to talk it over with\nSignificant other is in his interest that they want to just get on with the ... project so this way out with a consultant\nShowing the caller's talking about the colors\nAre sharing why they are the appropriate best like neutral flow color because of the undertone because you said you wanted it light in bright because you said you wanted it warm and cozy whatever they need\nYou can you help showed them why those are the the best colors and of course being a professional and knowing our our colors like like we all do\nIt's easy for us to go into that box of ah you know we have a box full of our samples of the same samples they have at the store ours are larger\nSo we are nowhere to go in that box and find what is going to work appropriately where the customer that's not their profession they aren't in the store every day they aren't looking at the our caller well every day so they don't know\nYou know the different nuances with the neutral they just see when they think is right but I owe it has a ... tone and they really wanted a yellow ... and that's where the projects go wrong and that's where we're the professionals it can help it turn out beautifully\nAnd it seems like one of those topics you really need to spend an hour the you really need talking about this on the radio you there's really professionals that do this but you spend a lot of time at home and that's where we relax and that's where we're most comfortable\nTo be sitting in an environment that the light you know different types of light affect our eyes on our mood different colors affect our mood different\nCombinations of those affect our mood and you really notice it when you walk into some place you can decide why am I was so uncomfortable in this location and it's a lot of times it's the color of light that is agitating\nYou that's very true and think about it when you're at the store\nWe have the big overhead fluorescent lighting so we have a lot of a big windows at the store is with natural hiding but it's not the same light you habits at at home the store light is different it's commercial lighting you what you want to have residential lighting we want to have your lighting\nLighting is the number one thing that affects color\nAnd then your surroundings ballots other colors\nThrough that light and mix things up and sometimes that's what makes it not turn out right so when you have your color consultant leading you through the process at home and showing you coloring contacts\nUh you get to see what's gonna happen I often find that the clients\nDon't try colors in a proper manner they they float a small sample that they've bought up in the middle of a wall and it's just out of context doesn't really mean anything the color consultant does what I called walk around the color they show up behind the sofa next to the drapes\nDown next to the base sports that you can see Flora base board and new color sometimes we need to block out a big busy bold red that's currently there so then we are trained that we put a piece of a large piece of paper white paper behind\nColor we're showing that you can block out what's

the Korea seltzer so green the blanket ... on the desert is green from all the yeah weeds that are popping up a ... like ... you look at the satellite image is brown and you look up and it's it's not even a safe place\nWell less you know for the last six years or a group of us go hiking and hunting up at Apache lake every December and we noticed last year all the ... um these the the ... the the main browse a shrub for\nDeer were all dry I mean there is about ... about fifty percent of the shrubs we're all dried they weren't dead but they had dry leaves on him they were all wilted and are just really struggling\nAnd this year I ... that we know that is going to change but in years past we noticed that they were nice and green and fall but that that last year this droughts really taken a toll that this is going to be a big help I bet this year\nWhen we had back up there again it's gonna be nice and green\n[laughter] I bet you're going to find as a whole new uh ... you're not even gonna feel like you're in the same place at the right to ... and ...\nAnd the one other um effect is gonna be the wildflowers and spring when we have a good ... you know a nice wet winter um it really produce a great crop of wildflowers in spring so that should be a a banner year if this continues like this\nEvery ... months when you come in we talk about a specific tree and we have the tree of the month which will be highlighting today\nWell this is one of my favorite trees of all time and is it is the piss stash\nTo stash or I'm Sorry it's the pomegranate this this this time I there are two of my favorite pie trees to stash and pomegranate pomegranate or a wonderful\nPlant in every respect is really considered a large shrub or small tree you can grow it either way you can kind of grow up to be pretty pretty tall you know ... minds about Fifteen feet tall in my yard they can grow up to be twenty or twenty five feet at maturity\nPretty slow growing but they they are multi stemmed they grow up from the ground or you know with multiple stems so they are great screening plant we use one kind of separates our pool area from the little back ordinary beyond it on and it's nice and full of course because it's producing fruit\nYou want it to be nice the branches to be nice and low right to the ground see it's easy for easy access for pruning or for for picking the fruit\nAnd what kind of ... do you get off of the\nWell the we're going to talk a little bit later this morning with someone who can answer that question even better than I can but I Will take shot is that what kind of fruit can you get off pomegranate well there are over ... varieties of pomegranate ...\nAnd they there are all for it pretty scene I'm at but at various sizes and qualities and and tastes\nAnd there's a few that are commonly available in in our nurseries it produce a wonderful\nOf pomegranate much this the same size and color that you can get in the stores\nAnd there are beautiful Advil edible fruit trees are giving you something back on your investment and this is one of those trees that\nI Would um I I think every yard nice little pomegranate tree they're easy to easy to to grow much easier than citrus even just throw 'em in the ground all grow up their deciduous trees to so they give you a little bit of fall color in this time of year will start to lose their leaves are just about now and it's certainly keep losing leaves all the way through November\nAnd be pretty much a barrel by December and but there are just so great a grapefruit tree and this is a time of year that that we harvest the fruit\nThey they have to be easy to grow up because they even grow at my back yard ... [laughter] I Need to see the YouTube thing again because I still have figured out your easy way of eating them they're\nThey're more trouble to eat then crawfish I Know I Know as a kid I remember you know opening those things up and picking out the seeds one of the time and thought I mean it was kind of a\nA a slow way to keep a a a young kid busy for for half an hour to my mom would probably give me one of those have you go sit in a corner pick through those but there is an easier way to open those up and get all the seeds out within about two or three minutes and I have a Youtube video look it up a\nPomegranate a ... an hour on YouTube and you'll probably find that there and it's kind of a fun method of a puff and I'm open an end to get all the seeds out and uh yeah there are\nA great addition to any yard and their this'll be a great time to plan up to any time there's a all deciduous trees can be planted in the winter you know turning the corner now into the cooler weather or you can pick 'em up at a local nursery or maybe even some bare roots or a plant available\nAs we head into December and January\nWith they register on the ... meter I Wonder I mean I ... I I I don't think so oh a ... meter covers a Oak Creek Flagstaff Flagstaff arboretum you're not going to get pomegranate grown that high elevation are ya\nKnow that's that's another good question because the pomegranate festival which was held last\nSaturday ... last Sunday and unfortunately we had planned to go but because of the big storm we had I wasn't sure the the roads are going to be good there was so much a flash flood warning we ended up not going but uh it was held in a school valley this year lots of\nYou'd pomegranate is up there in a barber will give us a little bit of a run down on that when we have her on in our next segment\nSounds good ... valley backed by between off iron springs out ... springs off yeah read out of ...\nOh yeah I was held an awful last year and the moves around it every year apparently I'm going to definitely be a part of it as soon as we can\nMaybe next year and put that on our on our events list the pomegranate festival All right I I meant to bring you a couple and I know you have a couple of yourself but I Want to shout ours is\nGoing to say it's finally about five foot height range and it had ... thirty beautiful time are granted sonnet

the sun and some kinds of birds will get in they're starting to pick them open because they're testing I'm too that's all they're doing is testing them and if they started opening those up and taken quite a bit of seeds you know they're they're ready to go\nA little secret that we found is to keep the birds out of them um you can put a small paper bag around him just a little a little lunch bag those little small ones you can just kind of put it over each individual fruit and just to put a food tire rubber band around the top uh at at the branch that they are attached to\nAnd and you can just keep the birds out you can keep you keep a few of them exposed to the birds will go go after those and then you'll be a um when when you're ready to harvest them you can just take the bag often

[noise] excuse me on one side of a tree you can be pretty close normally they\nAre the ... indicate one foot of distance from the tree for every one inch of truck diameter measured it about just tight\nSort about four or five feet off the ground if it's if the tree is twenty inches in diameter you should avoid any any um ah damage to the roots added a within twenty feet of the tree\nSo you're you're you can see that you've got to have a long ways away and at that point outside that twenty foot radius the roots are so small that it's in consequential in terms\nOf the health industry will recover any that being said many a lot of work has been done inside that ... what we call the critical root zone CRC\n... a lot of work has been done inside that twenty foot radius on single sides of a tree with no known harm to the tree because you're only cutting I Wonder if you did did that same amount of work on three or four sides of the tree\nOf course working inside that Sears he could really be harmful to the tree\nBut if you're only working on one side like the like yours and asked you have the fence on the one side and uh how far is it from the tree to that fence by the way I couldn't tell from the picture\nA it's about three feet\nOh gosh it is really close I thought I was I was more like six or eight\nUm but on the fence was beyond the the tree and the photo and I really couldn't tell the distance three feet away that that's almost impossible to get in there and use a treasure and cut along that sense\nUm with a tree planted that close to that wall I'm afraid that I'm a you don't have that option really isn't there to try to put a roof barrier and in such a close distance you could try it\nYou could get in there and and just go for it and uh but there would be a risk of destabilizing the tree but if it's it's if it's a matter of saving the wall oh that may be your only option and if the tree failed then you would have had to take the tree out anyway\nAnd depending on what's on the other side of that wall instead of cut or is it a neighbor's house or if it's open to the alley or something open if it's not hurt anything on the other side we can always an stacked that wall just put a link to low over it and re stack and you'll have a gap\nBetween the wall base in the ground that you could put chicken wire or whatever to keep animals from passing through that right now you you could just restructure that wall so it's really leveled and wrote you leave take that'll take that\nOne section of wall out and then as Rami said put a lentil or a beam across the the the the ... and then build a wall on top of that beam and leave a gap there for the roots to grow underneath and that's that's been done successfully as well\nWe appreciate the call that helps and good luck saving the Muskie tree that is hard losing a nice huge a shade tree they know already got a little bit of a ... well we actually\nWe actually got permission from our neighboring we built the wall into his yard six feet in his yard\nSo we had to get an exception on her title on our property and to actually build into his walk because he wanted to keep the tree too but it was destroying our wall\nSo we took it out and actually built a little a little ... a a a little section out into the neighbor's property now we both enjoy the shade of that treats there are options but you had to get cooperation neighbors across the way\nLet's see how we can help Dave who wants to talk about selecting a tree from Mesa welcome to the program\nHi Hi good morning thanks so

annually\nWe really recommend fall to be that time of year to do that and we still have about a month or so a too well the silt temperatures are relatively warm\nOr to get that fertilizer down the reason they recommend for full fertilization is because it allows the a plant to recharge a during the fall for it a really great a spring push of growth\nA root systems even though the tops of the trees can be ... in the dorm and see the root system to remain active in the soil because the soil is still warmer or an insulated from the cold weather and the research has shown that uh there's a lot of activity going on within the root system right through the winter\nSo they're ... the um the root system can be processing that fertilizer those nutrients and and storing them utilizing them and and getting ready for the spring push of growth\nAnd the research has indicated that is a great time of year to do that for those reasons\nOr if you fertilize leaders say in spring or in in early summer you're almost playing catch up because the tree has had to use it stored nutrients for that first spring push of growth and then you're kind of ... after the fact\nAnd so uh it's it's a good idea to go go ahead and do that fertilizing now um and then the tree is going to be able to really utilize that I'm\nIn the spring the other I'm just tip of the month is just to remember to be a little more like a little lighter I'm On the pruning for any of your ... sensitive trees like like citrus\nUm uh your histories your\nUm your orchid trees Hong Kong work it in some of your other flowering trees that are a little more sensitive to just be careful you're not a a printing them back to heavily\nOr they can just be groomed and shaped\nUm but just leave us as full a crown as you can you don't want to remove the trees winter coat so to speak this time of year other more vigorous trees can ... can be prone to little more heavily\nOr just the those that are putting on a ... you know a a foliage a little more vigorously like your ... your eucalyptus or your ... and others\nThat they can be prone to little more heavily because they can replace that foliage more quickly but just be a little more sensitive as a season goes on just be reducing the dosage of pruning right through the winter and then as we turned the corner into the spring you can start increasing that dosage of pruning for almost all the trees\n[noise] the last thing I Would mention is just to this is a great time of year to be composting\nI've mentioned is a several times throughout the year but it bears repeating the compost\nIs a a just a wonderful way to uh it's it's a wonderful way to to return to the soil all the uh the the the nutrients that are lost by raking leaves up you can take those leaves if you don't want 'em just scattered around your yard um uh you can pile them up\nAnd remember you don't have to be too good at this you can just put leaves rake them up into a pile find a corner of the yard somewhere you\nCan build a compost bin if you want and there's many designs where we can just put 'em in a pile compost happens to just leave it there\nIf it gets to slimy you need to add a little bit of brown leaf material if it gets to dry you need to add a little bit of green it's a combination of the carbon in the nitrogen the brown leaves and the green leaves that makes the compost happen\nAnd there's a pile gets bigger and bigger there'll be some combustion it'll be internal combustion it'll start to to happen it'll start to cook\nInside that pile and that's the the the magical compost it'll start to create a beautiful\nUm material that's going to be able to be returned back to your flower beds you can use it for planting you can use it for as a top dressing or the root zone of your trees and shrubs\nBut compost is a is a ... a great way to um a reduced the sole temperature around your trees it will ... are encouraged ... you know nutrient recycling it'll improve the microbiology within the soil underneath the the compost\nUh it it reduces dusty keeps the weeds down I mean there's so many good reasons to put that compost back around your your yard so\nGet that compost pile started now [noise] and uh you'll be really happy in the spring you'll have some wonderful magic\nStuff to spread through are a lot of these resources

idea\nIf in fact for age has a supply of kids eager to get their hands on learning the trades they've got several opportunities there are single project clinics at the Maricopa County extension

[laughter]\nI remember those might have been out of the day so my butt\nAt your good quality pain at a retail level um this is going to cost you around twenty five to yeah forty dollars a gallon depending what quality\nAnd then the last time I paid in my house I just for giggles added some of the additives that you can add to your ... I didn't see where it helped at all the idea about top drawer shelf paint and then I added the flow of flows all flow of Charles ... and I I didn't see where it how much\nYou can add a flood troll helps you to work with the pain better it helps to make it more ... in jail to apply to add a different types of ceramics which are supposed to keep your paint job cooler but I still think we're in

[laughter] yeah we're going to we're going to get to that route at some point the technology I don't think it's quite there yet what and then you buy this ceramic impregnated paint and I mean you're you're north of fifty bucks a gallon I just can't see you ever make it or turn on that investment\nYeah and the problem here in Arizona is you're going to get fading with regardless of what product you use so you know even even if you do go with that paint you are still going to get some fading in and you are going to have to repay around the ten year mark with with a product like that\nThat ten year mark is an interesting one because we have said here roses on the house for years that you really stucco application using next year could pay you really need to paint you're stuck go about every
