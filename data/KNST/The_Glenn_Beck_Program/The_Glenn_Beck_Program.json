that the ... and realizes that power he's\nGifted a given day you will only hurt people [noise]\nWill have to release has his alter ego vent him to say\nNo question\nThe mainstream media has been painfully obvious that they are not fans of Donald Trump on many occasions the attacks that are that they have\nA have been the hitting him with and then silently retracting are false but also the media has been under attack by the White House for very long time\nIt's not an issue with just the current administration and stop making it one President Obama was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refuse to say anything about it\nThe crazy thing is today\nThe craziest thing is is that the media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was weaponized sing the FBI and the de OJ against the press\nDonald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt\nForget about the oil I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail\nThis president is calling us fake news\nYeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting new people in jail he was what\n... the government against you and you failed to stand up and say anything\nOh\nAs a media was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake the New York times was publishing an article\nOn the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this is largely there's just just put this in your pipe and smoke it for a little bit\n\nThere being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president it's not a vendetta\nAnd while this is happening the New York times is printing ... an article titled five novelist imagine Trump's next chapter five\nNovelists imagine Trump's next chapter the main image\nAt the top of this story shows the White House on fire and thinking into the ground as President Trump waves goodbye\nEach novelist had one assignment right out what you think happens after the motor investigation is

mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come to surprise\nThey found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was not guilty it's crazy\nOne story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment or and another even had him uh being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated were advocating violence I don't know what ... what are you are you kidding me know that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\n\nIs the New

neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's going to be killed by the secret\nService this is unbelievable how is it the two hundred\nJournalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the

question don't you dare ask a question\nThis is frightening America fact\nFinding is gone the media has already made up their mind they know the answer and if you disagree they will chase you out of the public square\nThey have no inclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand\n\nYes there is a little righteous indignation and me it's not anger is it is righteous indignation\nBecause I have called these people I have talked to these people I have gone to them over and over again\nWe've had in hand and said listen you need to understand how half the country feels\nJust have a conversation you're making a huge error and yes I made all these airs oh my gosh I'm the worst person in the world I'm with you just listen to me please you have to hear what half the country\nIs saying they won't do it they're not interested they don't care and now they're quite literally making it up what's the difference between a novelist and in New York Times

are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nBut here's a radical idea if\nYou don't want to be called fake you might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n[noise] [laughter]\nI had a ... tax thicker and back program [noise]\nSelf awareness seems to be dead at this point in the media in particular Glen or maybe this one what is the one thing that if you're conservative Trump makes the ACA criticisms of the media they say\nHey it's fake news hey these guys are lying hey they're the enemy of the people and they say that the same as violence

random topic of the\nOnly other part of that ... yeah and he's a black face right like that you don't believe that they're getting\nCut again at the end the Jimmy Fallon one more because Jimmy Fallon has not a political enemies Kimball has put himself in as a political commentator so it's really agree just for him but Fallon who is I think there is no ill intent by Jimmy Fallon doing that but he's friends with Chris Rock writing\nBut the issue here is it on the freaking NBC yeah you can spirit us ally early for mentioning it but you know let Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy Fallon the top but place in your network so what she said was\nWeight but if you are if you are holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but\nIf you're holding somebody up like this woman who you

go ahead and get a pretty ordered get it's coming out October thirtieth you can pre order it on Amazon right now our police by Jacqueline\nNow Lindsey talking about the midterms there one of the things I'm inclined to tell you\nThat the most pervasive form of bias in the media is so many so many and they give you a little something here somewhat related investors business daily headline Trump's approval rating is better than you\nIt was an actor Trump has been enjoying a rare string of good news the economy is humming and the jobless rate just did a forty nine year low\nTrump won an intense battle over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court he's scared a replacement for NAFTA his poll numbers are edging up and Republican prospects in the mid term elections appear to have improved\nBut according to the Gallup poll Trump's approval rating adds up his six hundred and thirty second day in office was forty four percent as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now a higher they end or tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at this point in their first terms oh by the way right something you probably hadn't heard before\nHe's currently tied with Obama at forty four percent and above both Clinton at forty one percent and Reagan forty two percent at this same stretch and the presidency did you know that\nHigher approval rating at this point than both Clinton and Reagan\nTied with Obama but here's what's more this is not in the investors business daily article every Friday I go through all of the polling information that's been a credited for the past week I put together some information try to see what's really going on out there\nAmong likely voters you average out likely voters Donald Trump's approval rating right now is for\nPoints higher among likely voters then brought Hussein Obama at the same point in his presidency by the way\nWas pervasive for ... and the media is omitted oh and and ah ICU there's got to take this call Tennessee values we got a who got Taylor Swift Tennessee values Caroline in Nashville Caroline go\nI'm actually from Carter bill but that's quite All right [laughter] okay\nI'm right outside of Memphis, Tennessee and I just wanted to say that I kind of the value in\nKids as the kids say nowadays than\nIn October nicotine ... going that\nProgram and we need to have a pow about Elizabeth Warren to now shall we need to make that a oatmeal do that she made in Palau found don't know I think we should try that I Hope\nThat somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing because this is this is just outrageous\nDon't you think yeah she released this big uh basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper\nNATO she was a she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware yes a which is a is something that does not\nSeem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee\nAnd then they revise that you won ... ... the media revise they can they actually looked at the report and says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and ... then they realized loops deep sea we made a a math there this is a serious correction they didn't say what you do see in the corruption but they pay they should have\nA cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one uh one\nSixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in and of itself so he got the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those pieces would have a little bit of Cherokee\nNow this theoretically right but at least give her a technical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's a you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her stupid super recipes in Palau chat which is the goal of almost everybody\nHow how how how wild child and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's what I'm going all ... I'm going all full I I'm I'm just I'm going to I just\nBut let's all complain about the names of out ball teams but what's ... how ... from here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans since it's a tribe\nTo trial it does the I mean there are studies that show that the average person of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing in her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's\nA very DNA is a complicated matter and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to show that they've chosen show\nAny DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want any\nDNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against we have to use\nPeople from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well\nWay and there's the the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she is Native American blood\nIs not even what they tested or and even that is it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you if you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years he would not show the his Canadian blood fight like that's\nNot the only way they did it oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore\nHe was Canadian with DNA does is it shows that lineage against shows it it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns since I Wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic than a Robin\nFriends disorder or if it's true it probably would show that uh but so it's\nInteresting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling\nFlat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um it was her great great great great grandmother I think a several generations back\nAnd um when she register who's in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the born a campaign and and and then this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you get out of saying you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but what have we learned from progressive we've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not\nThat was what I was not allowed to apply to any well we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to\nAccept that she is so we can't accept legit [laughter] what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous this story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either but I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just play\nLooking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those you have to get them you know we've got to start making them a [laughter] I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from\nHowever\nKnow we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one\nOf my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather\nTook a horse of being a full size of course he was a he was kind of a that and he talked to him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else it but and he took him and he punched him in the head\nKnock the horse out\nOkay so ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people uh [laughter] and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather ... or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this and he picked it up and threw it over\nThe fence I don't know if that's true I got to go out and say it's not my family you don't know so he could be truly might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing yeah oh yeah this is what it was but it was it was it was not true how many advantages\nThrough your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls I was her I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told a story you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never you you've you've\nYeah yeah yeah I get it again if she is ... trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you'd better be right on these things and that's why it is I can give you that I got what it's about it I give you that you're not a huge story I mean ... you know we\nWell you know what is a huge part of the story is the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said quote\nA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lint lineage such as return ally a to an individual is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a da and ... a test to claim any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses wildest honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven Senator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal air at\nBecause he that's white twenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump and you'll never hear this from mainstream media because they don't they don't the Democrats don't want this known\nTwenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump voted for Barack Obama at least once many twice\nSo they came over from the Democratic side\nThey're sick of it they're sick of it\nNow they may not like his extreme tweets and everything else\nBut they definitely don't like the idea that yeah we are going to get rid of capitalism goes it's an old outdated idea yeah you know we think we should shut down free speech oh I hate those cops they're all murderers man boy man or trouble especially white man did you know that I'm Indian and that's really\nGreat I shouldn't have said India and it really should be Native American because India shut up nobody cares\nAll of this stuff that is going on in the world\nShut up the issue here is you\nDon't win that twenty twenty primary with twenty or thirty candidates in it without appealing to those activists who do believe all that craziness\nSo and they're they're so they're stop their hardcore incentivize right who when those people over early which is why they're all coming out and you know why the Spartacus moment happened is white Kamala Harris was so crazy during the Kavanaugh thing it's way ... on TV with you know with the crazy crazy stunts every day\nBut she does do how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to you'd have to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate you're not going to be able to moderate but those people how do you moderate how do you go\nOver to the side of ... and say hey I don't think anybody is wrong with that divide shout your abortion and then when you get the nomination\nCome back close enough to the center to where people are going oh she didn't really mean the shell the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean advise cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nYou're\nYou've been eaten you've been eaten\nBy the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news they may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not out shouting

advisers that have given a interviews or saying things that he had later to\nA unauthorized them so uh it is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very closed government regarding the press for example he has been using social media as his basic communication tool\n... this is the kind of ... ... ... same thing that you a job is said when he was running the first time he said oh no it's

create a new constitution for Brazil and that would be submitted a to a vote for ah after it so and in a console to two people to a electors in general so it\nHe had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will uh bring it back once he takes office\nBecause the fact is that he's not going to debates he uh is\nGiving a just a few interviews and usually he controls the process has been speaking mainly through social media so he has no conversation\nFrom the press and this ah creates a of an unknown territory we don't know what's coming but a analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time\n... including because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a performance in ... from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some

probably and those who can you help me war game that's been talked about this Saudi Arabia thing because right now Congress is saying we want to slap major sanctions\nOn them okay I'm you know where we're at a point to where uh I said you know back in the early to thousands you're going to get to a point where if you haven't dealt with these problems it's going to be too late and there isn't going to be a single good option you are not going to like the options and so right\nNow you have people saying yeah ours is Star Wars we're not going to sell them the arms more got slapped sanctions on they admit this this is horrible and it is it is and that's probably what America should do\nHowever let me play devil's advocate\nOil is already up at eighty some some ah oil is headed up to a hundred dollars a barrel\nWe've pretty much shut down the Texas oil reserves were I mean we're slowing them down because of the price of oil they couldn't make enough money so they kind of slow them down and we have to open those things back up again which we can do\nBut we're not held hostage by oil but a spike as severe spike a hundred twenty a hundred and forty dollars a barrel that's what collapsed us last time in two thousand eight was a spike two hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty dollars a barrel you also have turkey\nThis is coming from turkey and ... um turkey is no fan of Saudi Arabia um the balance of power with turkey is a little frightening\nEconomically the Saudi royal uh funds are big in Silicon valley and that's why one of the reasons why our stock market it's taking a hit at least in the tech sector because they think\nIf this goes the wrong way than the the ... the the funding is not going to come from Saudi Arabia anymore and you know where they're going to go to get it now obviously there is other places for them to get money for the tech industry but it was easy money\nOr from the Saudis it was easy to get they had plenty of it they were looking to invest it and when you lose a huge source of funding like that it's you know can hurt the industry\nYou also have Saudi Arabia being the massive check on um uh on Iran if they are weakened if uh they are a weekend in the area not only with Iran but also the Muslim Brotherhood that's a significant force in our favor\nThat I mean Saudi Arabia has remained the least bad option in the region for a while to Israel Israel Israel and Jordan there's others that are that I Would say are better options\nBut would that amount of power us and uh you know again credibility in the Arab world obviously Israel that doesn't necessarily have that um but you know Saudi Arabia you know\nIs a is the big\nA sort of backstop right so what are we doing can tap the worst of the things that are as an ... year presidents presidents do\nWhat do you do today I uh [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAh resigned [laughter] I Know uh I I think um you have to figure first of all we need I Would certainly the first thing I Would do is have more information that I currently do um so I think we're over\nThere with the king the king says she's screw up total screw up\nThis guy who they were out of control you know I wanted and brought over here they got out of control\nAll they started torturing him for answers he died than they just chopped them up put them in a suitcase yes all of that stuff is true and I can't believe these guys they've all they're already dead [laughter] or whatever\nOr you know but yes we did it\nShe's I mean I think you at the very least they're going to do something public right and you're going to do potentially sanctions or something of that nature\nUm you're probably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people are and sending that signal\nA and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with\nMean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore\nWe still have relations with a lot a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know\nThen I remember there was a world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem here is that uh they believe that he was um\nYou know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist is that let's let's", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program",

my day and then throughout the day I check those websites for information I Can't pay attention to the so called mainstream media it's too much for me I Can't watch it drives me nuts but but I think there's a formation out there but you have to be a little more proactive and finding it\nAnd if you watch the our TV dot com and you and your own Newsmax Daily Caller Daley wire Drudge Report I think you're good to go\nI agree except without referring to is that mainstream media where people don't have the intelligence and meet they don't go to that effort because they're they're on the fence they don't wanna ever conservatism is we need to get out there it'd be a competing like the local news and the mainstream media we need to get in there\nYou know Chris I I tell you what would happen money controls everything if CBS or ABC said\nFrom top to bottom from the top of the tree through the root system we're gonna have conservative viewpoint on all of our ah channels can you imagine the

a Sunday night on Fox on the radio but but\nHe needs to go out and this guy is wonderful the sixty minutes interview he took was least all apart on Sunday I thought it was fabulous and he's he's his

wasn't old enough during the Kennedy era Ronald Reagan yes\nThough we have Bill O'Reilly coming up in about an hour I'm going to be gone for the next couple of days and and the bill is going to come in and give us a rundown of the week so far and we have a lot to discuss one of them is Saudi Arabia this story is just getting more and more bizarre\nLet me bring you up to speed in case you don't know\nThe story started a couple of weeks ago with this idea that this Washington Post reporter is suddenly missing well he's not a Washington Post ... a reporter only\nHis name is ... and uh he is a Saudi Arabian citizen he is also a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nHis beef with Saudi Arabia in his own what he called self imposed exile is all about the Saudis\nNot to be friending and not I'm not excusing the behavior of the Muslim Brotherhood the\nSaudis are very clear that the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization and not a friend\nTo Saudi Arabia or really any one in the world so he went into self imposed exile a and he came here to the United states the there are claims that he is he he was\nStill a Muslim Brotherhood operative there are also\nClaims that he was feeding us information or a a a against the Muslim Brotherhood I'm not sure which to believe at this point\nSo he's overseas he's in Turkey and he is going to get married but he's been divorced to his wife in Saudi Arabia for him to be able to get remarried he has to have a a divorced certificate from Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudi Arabia and say well you're going to have to come into the embassy to get it now he is not a friend\nTo the Saudi Arabian prince the one who is banned this big reformer and he's going to you know take Saudi Arabia end of the future and he is good for women and he is good for human rights and everything else\nIs shaggy is not popular with that prince and that prince has not been popular with ... they he had been trying to get Chicago is a a shaggy to come back to Saudi Arabia but ... I knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in his ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nIs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though he was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\nMm but it's kind of hard to believe\n\n[noise] the new information today you know is is coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly or last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead\nUm but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation torture and killing\n\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true for her sake I Can't imagine\nEspecially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if it's if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you'd need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\n\nThis may be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that's\nThat's the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire\nBut Saudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia where currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen\nUm we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of warm machinery to Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is quietly supportive of\nOf ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel they are also a an ally with us against Iran they are a balance of power\nThere's no reason to feel pressure to not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation and you better take this tape seriously because\nIf I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and talk to everybody down\nAnd then what everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you do you do the tape because it's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not friends of ours\nThey are not friends of ours they are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it\nWe don't need it open up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it\nBut we'll watch this closely a it's a ticking time bomb ...\nYear and brains getting quite a workout Glenn Beck San ... am seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk ...\nEarning twenty four hours may contain diverging opinion\nFarfetched you say I'm Sorry I only have to argue if listeners are saying is it vice I actually asked you argue is my first lady and I and also encourage we have a ...

rape her depression never in a million years is going to give that allegation any exposure at all not it's not going to happen so you can talk about it I could talk about whatever\nShe had much more I mean she was credible she was okay it's\nJust not gonna happen than not going to get back into it um and they didn't report it when it happened\nArgue why are they then getting into the Monica Lewinsky thing\nBecause they have to at least acknowledge that Hillary Clinton beyond all rationality\nIs that is putting herself out there in these positions where she has to re litigate this stuff now the reason she's doing it is she wants to remain relevant so she can run again for president\n[laughter] no I'm Serious come on come on back I'm I'm really you\nYou know that I'm the most brilliant political analysts in the country now I don't I Am telling you that she wants to run again for president and\nTo know I Know she wants to run do you really think she will\nIt depends depends a lot on Biden\nIt depends a lot on um whether she feels that the field against terror is weak which it is absolutely week but the bigger picture is that the Democratic party doesn't know what to do with Bill and Hillary Clinton they don't know what the deal with them All right so\nBill Clinton and Hillary going on a road in there and and talk to their\nDevoted supporters this isn't an accident and this is a is a trial I mean to see how many people show up how enthusiastic they are a below say look when I was president we did all this and Hillary was a grade a first lady and she did all this and then she was a great senator and she was great secretary of state that's what this is\nIs it ... it up across the country to see\nHow it's going to fly but if you think Hillary Clinton is just going to go away quietly into the night she's not she wants to be president and she realizes that the Democratic field as it stands now is extremely weak who's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren I mean that\nA non American Idol [laughter] no that rushed her yeah it's horrible\nCrushed to the Boston Globe thought it was doing a favor by saying oh yeah we're uh if you got a little bit ah blood on average and then the Cherokee Nation the Cherokees themselves give us a knock it off where she's not Cherokee um this is a total Rosen fraud knock it off\nThe Cherokee Indians themselves\nCrazy OK and war and use that ruse as I say and my message of the day I'm Bill O'Reilly dot com today [noise] used the ruse to advance their current in academia\nSo\nAnd this is a woman who think she's going to win an election she's not only in Massachusetts that may be at Oregon you know these states that she could get into the Senate but as a national viable candidate in a way\nBelow as in the ... the number one political strategist a do you ... how could she come out with this whole thing was with Warren without having someone on record from the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I see how she got the ...\nShe has her grandmother who once told her when she was three [laughter]\nAnd she had high cheekbones and that's because way way way way back um uh she was a chair\nOr as a mother or\nYou know was a source of all of this but look I'm getting back to to backs a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is a ... oh yeah\nAll right John shut didn't fit in to the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there because she has her husband um and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nShe didn't receive Scully she's\nYeah she's a system a Paul would they call in New York you know Paul so\nBut she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Clinton about twenty minutes or so I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know what they may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than what\nIt was up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg\nIs going to run for president of the Democratic ticket and you know outside of New York nobody knows for Bloomberg are very smart guy by the way stream Lee intelligent All right but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do that a lot of money and he'll be in there\nBut other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\nI'm On an ... an older senior citizen\nI I Will tell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for a run and I don't think in twenty twenty ... twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether\nMichelle Obama has the drive but\nCertainly she would be formidable and then there's ... and it's the it's the reverse you know ... they're they don't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPraying near the you know I'm not sure you need the ah the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I'm going to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter anymore\n... smashed that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion\nSo you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right\nYou might you know this is in her time the next time around and you don't want to go up against Trump a certainly doesn't want to do that but into twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it\nI think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to you about um ... and what is going on in the streets of Portland more with Bill O'Reilly from Bill O'Reilly dot com and don't forget his new

weekend and said\nIt's time to bring the guillotine out for the Republicans I'm\nI mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets you um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\n[noise] well I Do a peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we'd go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper\nA with five hundred signatures are attached to it so the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have um some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing 'cause that's almost ...\nPossible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the ss has really essentially about and and a lot of people still want to look away at it\nThey they don't want to engage\nAnd um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive\nThe most and art elements in our society the pressure sympathizes with all of them\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive causes\nSo so that's a big difference we didn't have that what was left wing press we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's why we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\nUh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties or some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say a a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nA that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties\nThe press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody\nElse will take a cell phone video and throw it out which is what happened is that an over the weekend is that in the group\nDoing that without the higher security\nHave to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes\nIt takes leadership it takes organization but but on the press thing look what's what's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press is actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes solidly still try to do with\nTrump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia All right well they want\nTo not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran and the middle east mhm which the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading the charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed ourself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples\nOf countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but\nThe left wing press now says the Trump you're in the idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that and then not trade with them the sanction them boycott them all of that and they turn around and go the unintended consequence of that is\nStick around because we have some really good things are coming your way and a an announcement while I was supposed to make it this week

and they were done they\nWanted to leave they wanted to get out of there because as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS you know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more

was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into

All right so Beto is running here in Texas and if you don't have any haven't seen this you haven't been watching\nAny national media as far as not just politics I'm playing outside of that Ellen and cold there ... yeah every where CNN town hall coming up tonight just him um again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democrat\nThey don't or a base out of thirty eight million dollars and going out there who have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like\nCruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we know this could change\nBut well they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK\nAnd that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have it and I never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the\nThe margin now with cruise leading by seven points this is from by the way the same company that is hosting the town hall with better tonight CNN as their poll thinks you forty five\nI think he wins by twelve and maybe as high as Eighteen\nI made that would be a real surprise uh no it would be but you know that's when I mean is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe or believe the polls here in Texas\nYou know it'd be great if he won he won by three but I I just think that there is is something that ah you know when you get when you when you get right down to it Texans are going to say yeah I went to that group\nI tend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think I think tens possible though I mean nine or ten is definitely possible um interesting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for ah governor here in Texas\nIs winning by a much larger margin a usually is there I don't have the one in right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's money by so much he's up by age Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were evidence that by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the result of the same poll\nIs it the same people the same people\nWere asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for a great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um ... you think of it is bright red country right in Texas ... however are\nThe poll shows a fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters words a forty nine forty eight but still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas it this way try this on for size\nAh a Donald\nTrump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah\nOther days you're like oh can we not talk about today and I don't want to talk about the ... you know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life Ted Cruz was a very big picture or a big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city":

the department\nOf Yahoo ruin the victims be\nA ... ... you know dozens of families who were the victims of white these crimes I mean Whitey would\nOh I see what you're saying but he did he put anybody behind bars did he have did he ran out anybody that in the end of the government get anything\nThat's open to debate about the Boston Globe would tell you that yes yes he was a wonderful informing him that they broke the story but there's evidence to suggest that it was a it was a raider cover for just protecting Whitey because with the uh a\nFederal authorities trying to crack down on the mob or the Italian Mafia or any hit on the mafia would have to run through a ... winter hill gang and some people feel and claim and there was strong evidence to suggest that the informing part\nWas just the cover and really they were allowing Whitey the live so that the then head of the strike force in New England to bring down the Italian Mafia a guy named Jeremiah Tio cell of it\nI was looking for a little quid pro quo like hey Whitey we'll let you do your thing as long as you make sure the ... the mob doesn't you know\nKill me ah because there were incidence of lawyers and prosecutors are getting killed in retaliation for bringing down the mob so you know a lot of those allegations have not been proven but his real connection\nTo the information that he gave as being actually great invalid and information is is to me one of the myth of this case uh you know we we did much longer\nTime period to really discuss it but the documentary kinda delves into the how much free reign the guy was given and again if you're an informant for the government\nIt doesn't mean you can go and commit crimes that means you're working hand in hand with the government in exchange for some benefit like a ... like not being prosecuted or a lesser sense it doesn't mean oh\nPlease go out and Rob kills steel and maim people and there were there have been several civil suits brought against ah the department of justice that have not gone and the families a direction\nAnd so there's a lot of there's still a lot of bitter feelings amongst the people who were who were victims of Bulger's crimes some of them were you know criminals themselves but that doesn't that doesn't mean\nIt's still a man or the end doesn't justify the means arrive for this guy for a quarter century uh was allowed to just kill with impunity I mean he was tipped off in advance\nA about wiretaps he was tipped off in advance about potential rates are so it's really a complicated and in fact some people believe that\nThe sixteen years he was on the lam living in an apartment in Santa Monica with his girlfriend Catherine Greek uh there there are many including myself who believe that the government really wasn't looking very hard for him until a new\nRegime came in and then after sixteen years they decided to bring him to justice and and there was a trial in the summer of twenty Thirteen\nSo let's talk a little bit about the first myth you talked about that he was known as a you know a good guy in the neighborhood isn't that yeah I mean this is my impression and maybe I'm wrong in this isn't that kind of the thing with you know Al Capone tried to do\nThat and you know people like to think that I don't know these guys are just you know they're whacking just the bad guys there actually good family man you know and there was a day when you would kill a man and then you'd send his wife flowers\nYeah is that any of that through\nA ... that that seems to be the case that ah you know he also did some very good things as well you know for at times but for for some people um and also for example there was a big bussing crisis in South Boston you know a there was an attempt to a desegregate\nAnd there was a a bussing order issued and Whitey actually was very vociferous ... you know in campaigning against it and that kind of rallied south Boston residents a ... to him um\nHe was a good guy but because I mean that helped create cover for him and then he'll\nYeah exactly and his brother was a famous politician so there was a large\nUsing there as well you know with a ... you know build Bolger president of the University of Massachusetts in a prominent politician I'm so there was a lot of messy gray areas there with the balls\nAre so how did he was he involved was he just the guy saying yay whack him or was he involved in the killings\nOh he he took pleasure [laughter] and and being involved in the killings and you know his his signature because back then there was no DNA evidence his signature was removing teeth of his victims um you know uh\nSo that they couldn't be identified but no no he was a it was a willing and ruthless participant in some very grisly murders\nAnd there was a there was a there was a a\nNeighborhood house that they had called the haunting where a number of these victims were buried in the in the dirt basement of of the actual house that they used as a meeting place\nSo there's ... there's just sell a\n\nLot of grisly details with with this case but uh I mean the real for me the fascinating thing is after sixteen years\nOn the lam they finally caught him in Santa Monica living quiet you know living a a quiet a life a retirees life you know he had a ... almost nine hundred thousand dollars in cash and stuck in the walls and the coterie of a\nMachine guns and weapons but living a just a quiet life and when he's finally\nCaught and brought back to Boston for trial you know he offered to plead guilty in exchange for this is another\nI've been looking at some of the notices and these are some of the things that have been left out you know he offered to plead\nGuilty if they would take it easy on his girlfriend has you know who is living girlfriend Catherine Greek who joined him for the sixteen years of being on the run or on and off you know he ... he was willing to plead guilty if they would take it easy on her and give her some very light treatment a and the\nGovernment refused and you have to ask yourself why why did we go through a multimillion dollar\nTrial a four Whitey Bolger when the ... you know the the\nThe conclusion was foregone at the smarter than trial nobody thought\nHe would be found not guilty I mean the evidence was just overwhelming um and it probably would have saved the state uh quite a bit of money\nTo not try him but but ah they didn't take it easy on um um how they catch him up and how they catch him\nA there what is it you know they decided to focus on the girlfriend and they play some advertisements a and a woman you know noticed ah not Whitey but the girlfriend and called it in and got a nice reward for that\nSo we have slowly prosecuted the woman who turned him in\nA well no no no no not the woman who turned\nOh another okay another woman did not the girlfriend another woman current event okay okay okay now I'm he was killed yesterday I never I mean I besides Dr seuss I didn't know who would come up with a lock in a sock\nA buddy apparently was was killed by a guy they think is what are they I should say is there is a guy in prison who was a mob hit man\nWho they think killed him they know he was a mob hit man I'm who would was everybody against this guy was he marked for death as soon as they could kill him\nA well look I don't I don't have the details of yesterday and it's you know it's hard to say but you know he is responsible for helping\nOr you know bring down the Italian Mafia so you would imagine that uh there would be people who would be out for his his death or and you have to question you know the\nThe security and I you know it's still unclear to me I'm Still trying to get some information as to why he was being moved that why the multiple moves and why the lack of security\nOr you know some people are speculating that this was a purposeful move uh I I Can't say that but um you know a guy who's involved in multiple murders over decades and involved in bringing down the mafia or you know with ... with you know be a target\nWe're we're talking to a job earlier he is the director of why the United states of America versus James James Bulger who's the you know Whitey I'm and I'm I guess what was it that it ... due to the story why why did you make the film and what did you what attracted you to it and what did you take away from it\nYeah I mean I thought that ah you know Bolger finally bringing being brought to trial because there's there's such a myth about the guy there's such folklore [noise] you know in our society ... unfortunately we tend to glamorize Lake Erie\nGet ideas get involved and going and let's move down go\nLet's move that the only be a message from USDA ha just council\nFlorida burger chain thing it's tech factor you can now order using facial recognition at burger\nBy someone who's been burger file out they walk through the front door they know what they want they don't want to wait in line\nDarryl there is a burger fine partner ... veto Florida the key asked to sign their past orders to their face print allow them to take the flavor of the day and edited right there and then it's delivered to your table a few minutes later but that kind of scan always raises the question of privacy\nThere's actually just wait a minute we don't do anything for myself you know selling anything in the dark Web\nThing they keep the information between the customer and the kiosk your faces on file for three years and it's just for ordering food at that restaurant they say it'll never be disclosed to anyone unless ordered by law enforcement\nAnd not everyone is on board and veto resident Caitlin Hayward said he went in and that he doesn't think they should have facial recognition with Fox on tech really in lieu Fox News\nCNN always wonders why crown chant they dumped so much well you have to see what anchor Don Lemon ... is the biggest terrorist threat in America here saying put BU videos my town Tennessee not counting\n[noise] you're listening to ... [noise]\nWell next week is the election students got some election by the numbers coming up for us in just a minute but we want to do ah we wanted to introduce you to somebody in Mississippi that is I think a great state senator Chris McDaniel he is running for US Senate or however it is a different kind of system in Mississippi this is a\nThree way race or I don't know how many people are actually involved but the top two are are going to have to have a run off again so uh he just needs to make it into the top two and he could be the next Senate\nAh or senator for the United states out of Mississippi I'm as a state senator since two thousand eight he has written in sponsored a ton of legislation in Mississippi she has a fought for private property rights restrict the use of eminent domain\nThe student religious liberties act he authored and passed into law to protect the rights of students to pray in school\nHe introduced the firearms freedom Protection Act to protect against federal encroachment on Second Amendment rights fought against government paternal isn't by sponsoring legislation to allow citizens opt out requirements to provide personal private information in the use of a government a database he is now running for the Senate\nIn Mississippi his name is Chris McDaniel welcome to program Chris\nThank you glad I appreciate it's good to be here\nGood so so tell me what why people should vote for you in in Mississippi\nWell I'm the only lifetime Republican in this race the only conservative in this race my record demonstrates that I've been fighting these fights my entire life you might remember back its way fourteen we ran it gets that or if the cockpit and he was forty when your income but if we defeated in the first night with forty nine point seven percent of the vote\nA heat then recruits forty thousand Democrats to come back to a GOP primary and they beat us about one percent going down the stretch where it back in that said five this was the seat we feel like we rightfully one twenty four teams the establishment stole\nThis seat and now we walked the seat back on the conservative and I'm ready to fight Washington DC so\nWhat does it mean to be a conservative now Chris\nWell from my perspective that made the same thing that always says I'm a cow Jeffersonian a Reagan Goldwater conservative and what that basis whereas we demand limited government we demand individual responsibility we demand liberty we have to trend toward liberty and everything that we do\nAt some point along the way this country we advocated average ... government we gave it over to the federal government is counter week claim that uh forty so in everything that we do or empowering individual not the collective we're putting people on pedestals not politician that's what it means to conserve\nIt All right so tell me tell me is a few things where you stand what'd you think of um I'm Kevin uh [noise]\nI like that I feel like I used by the Democrats are probably should have been confirmed what sort of any what the evidence that I saw a what's not substantiate it was absolutely no proof that he committed any act if\nThat's the case or drive through process that or she is presumed innocent the burden was on her not ill he didn't have to prove his innocence to it she had to prove his guilt she couldn't do that so I thought what the Democrats put his family through was an absolute nightmare you should have been for much of\nWhat did you what do you think we should do uh with the the caravan if it makes it\nTo our border or they can't be allowed to enter period that's his bottom line rogue nation of laws and and they cannot defend its borders cannot recall he sovereign nation these individuals could not be allowed in this country period\nSo what do you do\nThe combination of several things if you have to use the military military but also I Would like to see if we couldn't get Mexico and Bob I'm tired of Mexico the ... the corrupt state that it is\nFailing to take action and allowing these people to go across their ... to our border I mean after all Mexico dependable enough to prop up the economy no trade offs that there is a direct subsidies they used to take some responsibility of stopping these people but if they stop the individual\nIf we have to use the ... the American military we've certainly will\nBirthright citizenship should that be a is that what the constitution says uh should this be a Supreme Court decision should there be an amendment and the second question can the president do that by executive order\nHere's the thing the the birthright citizenship it's absolutely not intended for children up in ... it's not intended for children to foreigners in this country that was never the case so I can say unequivocal that when it comes to free legal aliens ... never the birthright\nCitizenship if you listen to read or write a vacation to fade away all the ... that the Arthur made

loads all that on uh-huh and yeah there's like five horrible I mean the thing that people play basketball ...\n... sorry at science pain that people that basketball's not a bad thing though it would

mean the seriousness it's like\nThis what you said at the time and ... as you said your your poorly phrased it on Fox as we talked about just the next day you know he sees everything through the prism of race yesterday he said he was struggling with his with his life because of drink because of I'm a scientist because of his racial identity issues\nDrink okay you know a power work that have until

[laughter] you know you are you're pathetic you'll never be an alcoholic or right time\nYes all the time you said not drink until it was five PM whatever that so it kept me from being an alcoholic and I ... it really was your little line that you drew the line this crazy line because they thought\nAlcoholics or drunk all day alcoholics get up and they drink so I'm not going to be like so I'm not an alcoholic and I would literally no matter where I was I had alcohol in my hand and\nI watched either [noise] anything\nYou've watched either on my watch or a clock I Would watch the second hand do the

'cause my still would say I I go to my daughter's wedding but I don't know how I could reconcile that\nOh well it depends on\nDo they still wanted to vote without his they may not or if they're at fifty fifty I say go to your daughter's wedding yeah if it's less let let's play the game though it is forty nine forty nine essentially you'd have to probably elderly parents\nWell no well yeah I mean it but again let's say mansion switches right now he's a Democrat one Democrat voted for the Republican so\nSay ... signifies today or that he can go and and vote for the Republican but let's say he he changes that tomorrow so instead it forty nine forty or not it's not a sure thing you need ...\nI got to say like\nMy ... in Charlotte your gun was title with my daughter but you know in the end you you really think that I kind of had the other opposite thought which was my initial thought was this is really important\nI think of my actual daughter not like a you know now own daughter but like my daughter ... she's getting married screw this country I Am they're like that's like the most important thing in my life I did sign up for that job but I did not sign up to a band in my family\nNo you didn't but your family can that can be move for instance if the vote is it you know two o'clock\nA that is still what a Montana time noon or eleven o'clock you could say hey move that I'm going to vote at two o'clock eastern time that's eleven o'clock if the the ceremony was supposed to start at noon started it six started at three and I'll be there\nBut the ... vote right like move the vote\nYou know they're they're planning on doing by the way if they need ... they're going to delay the holy until he comes back oh jeez delayed the vote well only if they need him right now that doesn't look like they need it we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty nine easy thing to do you could just ... it doesn't have to be tomorrow it to no\nNo they can relate to it on day yeah or easily yeah or Monday but there's that risk of like you know some new act using a crazy thing that happens you know what the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding\nYeah I don't I Can't see myself missing my daughter's cat", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year":
