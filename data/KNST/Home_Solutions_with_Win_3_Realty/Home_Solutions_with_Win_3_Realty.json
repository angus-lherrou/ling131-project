but some Democrats are hinting they'll continue to try to learn more about the sexual misconduct allegations against him\nBack during the um you know oh seven timeframe I mean people were in the mid six is getting a loan and and again overtime I purchased my first home and talked about this many times in Nineteen eighty two and the prevailing rate was over Eighteen percent back them up\nAnd you know that it was crazy new car loans were Twenty one percent interest\nAnd uh you know they got a new car loans that are you know just one percent interest so it it's um\nWe're we're in a in a great time we we have a tremendous shortage of homes across the United states and and now with with a hurricane in North Carolina that's just placed a whole bunch of people and and you know that is going to affect short term the jobs report because on that's\nWhat happened this this this this time so that the jobs report that came out and thank you or are they the jazz working at a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were created in the month of September the prediction was close to ... one eighty to two hundred\nRight we've averaged two hundred and one for the entire year\nThat's right so it it we fell below protection but Wall Street extracted off as well that was destruction from the hurricane that's why it was a\nUm that's why this summer came short so it's funny that the bad news that happened Wall Street is just kind of in the bond market has kind of shrug it off like oh that's because the hurricane um now the real meat of the uh equation is um the hourly or weekly\nOr a payroll numbers right is what people get paid on a weekly basis is actually higher\nAnd that is moving higher which is showing that there is wage inflation and that was the route of what what has caused mortgage rates to even\nA a worse or you know sell off as we call it a\nOn a into friday was because of this number that shows that that inflation is taking place in people's payrolls people are being paid more for their their hours\nAverage across the United states the ... year over year numbers to point eight percent um so the average American is making two point\nAnd ... percent more than they were last year at this time and when you look at everything you buy a new ad in the labor cost of of that any kind of service industry or store or anything and and we just ran into this uh this week in a um\nWe had a roof report back in a in a contract that was written in may and\nThe people had a a clause in their contract that they it was a contingency clause so basically they needed to sell a home before they could buy another home well it finally you know we got this deal closed the last day of September\nAnd the roof report um you know and that we had for me they said well we're going to need to be quote that because a lot of the prices of roofing materials of increased ... so\nAnd the uh other agent had ... had a company come out and just not looked at the roof quote but looked at the\nHome inspection report where they indicated a bunch of broken tiles so they went in and replaced all the broken tiles and they said well that was four hundred and something dollars and it's like well we had to bid for Thirteen hundred and forty dollars outcome and we look at what was done is like well what about ceiling all the chimney caps and and and doing all the other things that were on there\nWell the roofers right now with all the rain are backed up about three weeks so they so we can't get out there and and and that needed to close at the end of September so ah we went ahead and close the deal well we've got the roof quote I'm this week\nAnd that even though the four hundred dollars worth of trials have been replaced the bed came in and actually higher than it was previously because of cost of other things and we called the company and they said well you know will stick with the quote we gave me before but I mean our costs on everything has gone up\nAnd I was just talking to a a builder friend of mine um is at our CrossFit gym this week\nAnd he said you know concrete is a hundred and twenty dollars a yard yeah I mean I I build a hundred and sixty houses in Tucson but I haven't built one since two thousand and stuff and we used to be a concrete at forty two dollars yard in or seven so if you want to know why house prices have to go higher\nI mean not only is labor increasing but the cost of materials is going I yeah and and the lumber with the uh you know Canadian lumber embargo which should settle now that the NAFTA thing has been resolved and then we got to open trade but you know what that tactic really did work to negotiate a better a better deal for the United states\nUm so so Jerry and and uh we've talked about Hurricane Florence and hitting in just dumping on North Carolina and parts of South Carolina\nI'm you know they're saying that a near term that's going to you know everybody kind of frozen a bunch of people got laid off and nobody was doing new hires during that time but now wants to rebuilding starts there will be actually more need\nFor people to know where it before so this downturn in the job's number is a short term thing that's really driven a lot by the hurricane\nAnd and you know we we if people have been\nIt's been a hot topic at the at the polls for a long time about you know minimum wage and having a Fifteen dollar lowest minimum wage in in the United states and I don't know if you remember what your wage was in high school I started sacking groceries\nAt two dollars and thirty cents an hour that was the minimum wage in Nineteen Seventy six so um you know for somebody I'm working at a job I mean Fifteen dollars seems like a lot like a lot like ethics sex on what it was back in Nineteen Seventy six\nBut when we come back we've got more I'm a news to talk about we've got uh some some more on the job to report and also I'm an interesting story on a Denver regarding homeless people will be back

home prices are starting to stall and the numbers of sales are lower than they were last year\nWith the number of homes for sale or lower than last year because there's no end the story so if you don't have as many to sell how can how sales numbers keep up with with the same number of them were actually very close to last year as a matter of fact last month we we tied a dead I I'm with the with the previous year\nBut here's what's interesting this a mark swimming as a chief economist at first American\nHe said in September consumer house buying power declined\nTwenty eight thousand dollar um compared to a year ago if household income has not increased compared to a year ago the increase in mortgage rates would have reduced consumer I was buying power\nBy thirty thousand dollars so yes wages are up and that's a good thing for the people that are you know I've been struggling I haven't really seen wage increase for you know the\nTen years almost I mean it just everything's

when three team leader ...\nGood morning and welcome back I'm In the studio with Jerry sent a VIP mortgage and right before the break we started talking about the pathway to purchase program which this program actually allows you to\nUm get a government money for up to ten percent of the value of the home you're purchasing and you can use that in any way you see fit as far as you can use of torn down payment if you've been in ... lost because you needed three percent and closing costs and other people didn't ask for that\nYou can use the money to three percent for closing costs um if if you're smart and you talked to a jury son he'll train you that you could actually\nPay two percent toward the I'm a mortgage insurance right up front by it out and buy it out and that way you get rid of the mortgage insurance on your payment which lowers your monthly payment and\nI'm also if you pay your closing costs you still have five percent off to the value of the home and this program is if you stay in the home for five years\nThen you don't have to repay the mortgage mortgage just goes away so they put this second mortgage on but if you stay in the home for five years as an owner occupant then basically the loans forgiven\nAnd it's up to twenty thousand dollars I mean it's a big chunk of money\nIt's a big deal I mean how long does it take an average American family living in Tucson, Arizona making forty seven thousand median income roast a year to put away twenty grand right I mean it's huge but then the average American family doesn't even save two hundred dollars a month\nSo twenty thousand dollars is a hundred months of of savings I mean that's eight years just if they said religiously two hundred dollars a month\nRight right no it's it's it's a gift horse but it's a um it's running in very short supply and so it's it's funny the last few days so ah I had you know the we had four we met it on um when the window open and none of them got accepted we're with them we were within minutes\nI'm going and so it's really um and and\nConcerned now about November because all these people and covered it didn't get the money if sellers are willing to stay and allow them to extend the they're closing dates what is going to happen in November\nI there's that many more backed up people\nIt's going to be a blood that so I'm the only solution that I see that as a um is you know for sellers anyway is that if someone says oh they're approved going you know using pathway to purchase\nA ... but you know it's all you have to say look you're approved rate but if you don't get the funds you have to have a backup plan and you know if you're not going to get the if if you don't get a lottery of funds and you got to go with another downpayment assistance or something so it is because sellers have to protect themselves\nAll the worse I mean basically when you when you accept an offer your home goes active contingent\nAnd it's it's tough to market nobody goes on showing homes that are already have accepted offers on them so you're showing activity just comes to a screeching halt\nAnd and now you're sitting there with an empty home with a buyer who may not be able to qualify and and you know the whole thing with with um alone is when when you write an offer and it's accepted there's three contingencies you have an inspection contingency which isn't just inspecting the home that's\nI I Want to verify that there is no sexual predators anywhere near I Want to find out you know you went to school scores are and you know the all the different things you have a ten day window typically that's that's the default on an Arizona contract where you can for any reason cancel and move on after that ten days you come back\nWith an inspection report either I cancel or I Would like you to fix these things and that's a buyer inspection noticed seller response well the next thing to do after the repairs have been negotiated is to order the appraisal there's an appraisal contingency\nHas to have praised for as much as as being paid or else you know there there's another negotiation taking place well after the appraisal comes in assuming it came in and value are higher\nThan that contingencies removed but all the way to the day of closing is the financing contingency when I can buy this home without alone so here a buyer comes and writes an offer I'm going to close in six weeks\nSo think about this here we are in the first week of October six weeks from now we're at Thanksgiving right and then this person says oh I Can't close because I didn't get the money\nSo now you have to\nTry to sell your home at a time when everybody was decorating the home they currently live in for Christmas and nobody is outhouse shopping very few people and and your number buyers just died and I mean this cost you a sale this year and on a vacant home that's sitting there I mean you're carrying cause can be up to one or two percent a month\nOn tearing that house just the taxes keep going the insurance the utilities the ... and and you know vandalism increases on a vacation home builder hunger it's a ton of market so there's there's all kinds of adverse\nEffects and and we actually had a deal that the fires were counting on halfway to purchase money\nAnd we accepted their offer our our clients did because they didn't ask for any repairs\nOr any closing costs excuse me closing costs well they did not get the money so they called back and said hey we still want the house but we're going to have to renegotiate because we need closing costs now\nSo all of a sudden the seller who's been high fiving everyone thinking their house is sold\nIt hasn't sold anymore so so that's the problem I Wonder what agency Jerry's that that's that's allocating these funds are you hearing department of housing okay so I mean that's a ... is there any way that anybody could go to them and say this is ridiculous scheme you got\nGoing on ironically I was on the phone for hours with or that aid for the um this past week and um you know there's nothing that um they at least they weren't they I talked to many people there and said yes this is our deal we we can't change it it's a um\nMore effectively re regulated where we're not going to change it this program and\nWhat we're trying to make it as fair for everyone as possible\nWell the the first time this program on out years ago it was there was not a monthly women can be used as much money as you want to put into the money was gone and and ... during that first run up you know so much where she is\nIn the first few months but then it kind of died off you remember that wasn't a big thing anymore", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Home Solutions with Win 3 Realty", "city": "Tucson",

Thirteen hundred days my gosh are three hundred sixty five days in a year\nNow but the the lack of maintenance is that the issue right in that house it's just more and more maintenance\nThan what if the roost started leaking and now it's getting wet season after season after a season we actually had um a property a note that we've purchased up in Milwaukee that hadn't been lived in for eight years\nIn the basement had like four feet of water in it and in the wintertime it was an ice skating rink and in the summertime it was a swamp and and and you know there's always we ended up selling that hope that note once we we got the property and we ended up selling for Seventeen thousand dollars in a neighborhood that sells for close to a hundred\nBut I'm so there's always a buyer for everything no matter how bad it is and ah but this is where you know understanding the market and having your thumb on the pulse of what's happening out there\nIs really really important and you know the president you might have heard in the last several weeks he's doing a lot of flying around the country having rallies before the midterm elections sure\nAnd these multiple times called out the Federal Reserve saying knock it off you know this is high enough the economy's coming to a standstill because you're raising the rage too high and every other recession\nHas resulted from the banks lowering the rates are raising raising rates too fast for over correcting mhm and they don't give it time to you know the market to adopt to it and see if it keeps going and then hit it again they're just going bam bam bam and and uh\nYou know in some cases a lot of people are just conspiracy theories that they're doing it on purpose because every time there's now during the ... that's when the banks make more money so um what's your thought on that you're in the banking\nBusiness yeah it's a it's clear [noise] you're starting to hear that\nMessage over and over again not just from from our ministry but from a a from economists out there that you\nKnow are we raising our rates too quickly um and have we\nAre this is really need to be kind of talk through before we continue to raise and you're seeing that in this past week the volatility in the stock market and earnings and also why earnings are lower potential earnings were from these companies is is directly related to\nIn some cases to interest rates rising up to rapidly so it's uh it's interesting um it'll be it's gonna be next interesting next few a few weeks for sure\nAll right we'll talk more after the break this is Tucson solution\nHigh it's Garrett Lewis let me tell you about my buddy Bob Zach minor he leads the wind three teen power by e XP reality and get this\nBanks call Bob when banks can't give someone along because they don't fit the stereotypical box the banks called Bob to get the deal done if you've been rejected even though you have a good downpayment call Bob three one for sold and if you're a frustrated agent is lost sales\nCall Bob to find out how you can work with him and his when three team powered by e XP realty three one for sold eyes Karen Lewis if you are a real estate agent that's down on your luck not working out too well\nDon't worry my buddy ... who leads the wind three team at the XP realty trains agents all over the country and he's willing to train you you'll learn how you can get your sailors more money for their homes\nAnd help buyers that banks turned down learned bombs creative ways to help your clients to buy a home and sellers keep more of their money Bob leads the wind three team power by e XP realty three one for sold\nVIP mortgage we take a great deal of pride in being the preferred choice if she's not kept real estate agent in like ... at when three real T.

In the studio with Jerry son to be a mortgage and Jerry is you go to guy when it comes to getting a mortgage refinancing your loan restructuring and you know during had right before the break a story he was going to share with us\nAnd several of the people who listen to this program of contact the jury over the years and restructured their portfolio and this is where having somebody that really understands you know the time value of money and then what's better you know you might say well I've got a three point five percent loan\nBut it's a thirty year alone in your twelve years and you've got Eighteen years left to pay so why would I Want to go in and refinancing you know four and a half percent on\nWell if you sit down and run the numbers maybe it's better to have a four and a half percent loan for Fifteen Years and not\nThose extra three years of payments to see what that comes out to and and that's the kind of thing the jury will run for you and actually tell you you know this is a better thing or you know what I Love about jerseys honest and if it isn't the best thing is going to say you know what you should just stay right where you are because that's the best thing you could do so what's the story Jerry\nSo as a general in contact me last week it's a radio show listener and he owns eleven um property finance properties which you know in the world the conventional financing when I say conventional that's Fannie Mae Freddie Mac the max you can have is ten\nSo uh when you have eleven it's problematic because you cannot refinance your your any of your properties except their primary residence\nOr and this particular situation the borrower had some private money arms some adjustable rate mortgages that were coming due soon so he had to do something and he went through different lender and the other lenders I'm Sorry I Can't help you because it was over eleven probably you know you had eleven property\nSo we sat down and met last week and started we'd look sort of looking around and hey what what can we do to fix this problem and sure enough we came up with this game plan where um it was such a win win situation for for him and his family that I'm an end up saving them over six hundred dollars a month\nAnd a ...\nBut we ended up bringing up a another slot for him for being able to buy a property down the road\nSo it was a um it's just funny where it just when you take outside look outside the the the box and just say oh you have eleven property so I Can't help but instead if you turn around and say okay let's look and see what we have here and let's look at a ... a B and C and\nYou know I don't know the outcome when I start analyzing surfing and like I don't know which options going to be best let's just put 'em all out there and then we'll never know when you're on try it right\nAnd we did just that insurance up ended up coming up with this great plan that um is is are going to set him up for a huge win for for for for many many many years so it it just sometimes it is worth doing is really worth doing just that I'm taking your portfolio and let's analyze it\nAnd and look at it from abroad macro perspective to see what we can do to to help a person situation\nSo six hundred dollars a month that's a hundred and fifty bucks a week basically ... and ... but more importantly it's seven thousand two hundred dollars a year\nTo just take that out ten years at Seventy two thousand more dollars you put in that guy's pocket mhm this from someone else told them no and so I Know that doesn't work I mean you have too many loans I Can't help\nYou in this case you know he had a private money one that was coming due so or whether they know what's going to be called so he was going to have to you know sell it and sell it very quickly and which may have worked out fine but sometimes when you are have to sell something quickly you may have to sell it for less than you would\nIf if the normal market was on the they put them in it it kind of put them in a corner in a way and and uh um when we got done it was wow this is better than you know\nCould have ever predicted and that's the only that's the success stories we liked it it it was\nAwesome you know what that's um you know one of the reasons why I just love doing the show which areas as he you know he never says known in the ... and I I Can't tell you how many people over the years\nHave saved their deal because the you know something happened the buyer you know did something stupid went out and bought a bunch of furniture the week before closing or something and and ah you know sometimes that's not able to be changed but oftentimes Jerry can just say you know something simple like\nWell do you have someone then my co signed for you and and boom problem solved A M and nobody else even thinks of that and and that's you know just common sense and and a lot of experience as what is what makes that happen\nAnd that is so anyway thanks for helping our radio listener and and wherever that was that's listening a thank you for for helping promote our show I mean this is we we love to help people and\nAnd uh that's when we try to do every week not make the show or a big infomercial about us but try to provide knowledge in in in a\nNew ideas to people to educate them about the real estate market where they can make wiser decisions decisions with their finances absolutely so um let's talk about there's an article Jerry came on a everybody talked a little bit about zombie properties and [laughter] you know we don't have a lot that\nI I have to say this article did come around right around Halloween\nYou know [laughter] and and what is is on the property and you know it's a property that basically the people moved out of before the bank foreclosed and it's bacon and sometimes that can be taken property for years and even upwards of five years\nWhere nobody's living there and the neighbors are frustrated because there's all these deferred maintenance items and people are breaking instilling all the copper and now they're coming in and after school and you know doing things and bad things that they shouldn't do and and now crime is entering the neighborhoods so that's why it's a big deal and there are some\nMajor cities around the United states Philadelphia\nIs one that has one of the highest percentage of zombie properties out there and it's it's funny a lot of these are in the rust belt areas Illinois has a ton of them and the government I'm actually city of Chicago spin over three million dollars buying up these properties and and just to lock them up born I'm up in and take control of them\nBut I'm a you know when you hear all these rumblings about oh the economy is slowing down and I just wanted to quantify something there was an article came out this week called coming to America and it's talking about foreign nationals coming to the United states to buy a home and that oh my gosh the searches",

not support the thought that Pima County would just simply bonding and put that debt and the county to go fix our roads and where were the priorities in the county budget\nOr why weren't why wasn't that money being spent as it should be on transportation and roads and so on and some other priorities in the county I see the small business sentiment was no when we went to the board of directors

that is the train there so there I think there's additional surveillance resources that are needed\nAnd we also need increased border patrol though we're having a challenge in recruitment and retention that's a whole other issue that\nI Know congressman Sally and others have worked on did you all we can to recruit and and for the fire border security and then assist our sheriff's with additional resources and so you're playing a major role in this\nUh but I Do think Wallace is part of this but you're right if they're cutting through it or scaling over a and it's the drug smugglers and human traffickers we need to figure out another solution\nOh it's just terrible I mean of the people really new\nI mean this ... billions and billions and billions of dollars that's going back and forth across that open border and and the structure of a children's lives and the goal of an elderly people dying out the desert um this is just and saying that the ...\nOh wow a weakness in our border that what people against our country\nYeah no you're right absolutely thank you so much for the call ... thank you for getting feedback\nThank you very much for taking my call but I Do jog or Steve and trucks Coleman before I Do have a question for you wouldn't be able to track a little bit we've gone through this debacle of what I call that would describe northern okay what's your general feeling about what happens\nPolitical chaos and dysfunction I guess I could summarize it was a horrible to watch regardless of what side you might have been on um I think both Dr Ford in judge Kavanaugh were victims of this political process\nUm the Senate Democrats said on this for several months she wanted to remain anonymous and yet they pulled her out two days before to testify at MIT just shows you how\nTo show you girls will it up\nI think so I think it was not on a\nLittle bit better idea that we do 'cause you're a little stuffed closer to all this garbage that goes on yeah if I was in the hands of the the abuse ...\nWhat a fiasco for an and think how their lives have been impacted me Dr Ford end judge Kevin I mean I think it's a shame and I thought it was just total political dysfunction\n[noise] but it shows the um\n[noise] it it shows that the dysfunction and it shows the the lane set which people will go that are there in Washington too to manipulate and when you go back and look at things that have been happening for years now there is just so much and I think that's what the American people are fed up with\nIs you know the most recent stunt with with um judge now justice Kavanaugh was awful but it got so many people fired up on both sides we've talked on the show about how\nFriends you can't even go out and have a conversation anymore you can't be a woman\nAnd disagree that all women are not telling the truth because all women do not tell the truth just like all men don't tell the truth whether it's at whatever the topic is there's just not in it that this\nThis culture that we're in right now of the inability and I don't know how much you've experienced um\nOr see it but we see through social media just the interaction that\nThat whether it starts at the high school level to college to beyond a difference of opinion a difference of how you deal with something nothing it's not tolerate it any more if you don't believe that the way the mainstream or how you're wanting to what they're wanting to\nYou to believe there's a narrative out there that if you're against that narrative and a lot of people are it is just set it that the whole political climate has become yeah and\nI think it it ... how we get things done right ultimately I don't even hardly anything with this political discourse\nShit or the simple idea you're prove you're innocent until proven guilty\nAnd I completely support you're innocent until proven guilty\nAnd it's just a ... a mess that up right and that if I rule of law allow people to lie\nTo think that can lie and their word is going to be taken because then they hide behind the me too movement and the ... movement in the ... and everything else\n... and what they're doing I think he's bringing down the importance of the me too me what it's supposed to be being brought down by the ... yeah just said even if it's not there and we'll go ahead and back you and then we'll blame the other person\nBut then what about uh what about the other side of it\nOkay what about the other side what about the today we're bullies are going and what they're thinking and we're going to be\nBoys are not going to want to take any risks they don't want to be strong anymore they don't want to be what they were brought up to be they don't know we're worried about women and we should but I'm worried about boys understand where they fit in society where am I going to fit\nYeah you know it's what okay so your opinion\n[laughter] after that I just uh\nYou know this ... regardless of the issue in an alley it's

I. N.

[noise]\nGood morning and welcome back I'm In the studio with Jerry sent a VIP mortgage and Jerry is you go to guy for home loans and refinance is and if you have more than one property you definitely need to call juries and\nHe's got his thumb on the pulse and basically you know it's it's here rates are going up we don't think they're coming back I don't expect him to go up more so now is the time to get in and and\nFigure out what what should I Do when you've got these properties am I going to hold them I going to keep them if you have any kind of long term plan and and possibly one of you know get some um\nYou know some equity out or something I mean this is where Jerry will help you and and he's helped or listeners of this program save over twelve hundred dollars a month they still in the same properties or payment went down by twelve hundred dollars a month\nAnd and I just by restructuring the debt so ah Jerry if someone wanted to contact you about either getting recalled for a new home purchase or adding to their rent rental portfolio or I'm just you know refinancing restructuring the dead on what they already have how do they reach\nSure my number five to zero three\nSeven zero nine five seven six\nAnd you know what I what I Love about Jerry's if if you meet with him and\nAnd he says well you know what you should just really hang onto your three and a quarter percent loan I mean I Can't touch that and it wouldn't be wise for you to to do that or instead of refinancing that maybe we can put a second on it but seconds are you know they'll just rate loans it's crazy I look the other day and we're over seven percent for an adjustable rate loan\nSo I'm arms are uh adjustable rate mortgages five your arms or not they're they're they're actually a little bit lower their singing the hype for it but I'm seconds you know equity lines of credit are getting up to seven percent because\nBanks what they do is they they will be a prime rate plus a margin that's how most banks do their their uh\nTheir equity lines while we forget primates moved up to five and a quarter percent or so it'll be five and a half by by December so you know if someone's prime plus one that's what the bank you know give you\nGoing to be at six and a half percent so equity lines are not cheap anymore\nOh well that's very interesting so Jerry um what do you what our rates this week haven't seen any change after that jumped up so much last week has there been any settling out or\nNo so mortgage rates are thirty year fixed mortgage rates are are sitting right around five percent you know for um a Fifteen Years in Fifteen year fix mortgages are in the mid fours\nI'm at a VA or in the high force so rates are moving higher but again they're still historically low and they uh\nYou know they're not going to be coming down anytime soon ... when you look at the protections and I\nRead a lot of protections in forecast from all the major investment banks around the country and they're all predicting that treasury yields are going to continue marching higher in two thousand in Nineteen and potentially even to two thousand twenty\nOr and so you know we're just rates are going to be somewhere in the five to five and a half percent rain for the next probably six months and then you know but that's OK that says we\nOvertime I mean when you look back over time I ... from Nineteen Seventy one which is when Freddie Mac started tracking mortgage numbers all the way until two thousand and four and the rates never once drop below\nSix percent and then they they actually fell below four percent for the first time ever in twenty twelve so everybody got used to this for the last six years but it's really that that's you know a short clip of of time and and the overall scheme of things and and you know if there ever was another major downturn the banks have to have room\nAnd the government has to have room to lower the right back down to encourage people to borrow and so that's why we got to push a little bit higher\nAnd and that's you know a ... it's funny where where you're starting to see a lot of talk about recession and the ... recession is on the horizon whether it's two thousand Nineteen twenty Twenty one or maybe even pushed that twenty ... twenty twenty two but one is going to be is going to happen I mean it's a cycle\nNow the million dollar question is how deep whatever session sure has some recessions are pretty mild and they're not not a big deal but then or you have and that are ... are quite steep which is what we went through in two thousand eight\nUm it's it's inevitable for when that happened but we are in the longest recovery cycle I think the second largest longest\nAnd make it through the end of the year will be the longest\nIt'll it'll be the longest that recycles so you know it's a um\nInterest rates will be moving higher over the next year and when you look at it that you start to settle down and they're not increasing at an unsustainable levels I think the buyers confidence will be will be continuing to um pushed them into I think it's time to buy\nSo it's all about confidence when things get too hot or too cold it's been a and they just decided to hold off as long as we we keep that we're not too hot not too cold will be All right they call it that gets the gold ...\nYep I'm hey Jerry I'm going to throw something in here when I we have um\nA lady that has been listening to our program since we started\nAnd it's really funny over the years she's called me and said you know I listen to your show every Sunday I get out of church and I and I listen to it on the way to the casino\n[laughter] she this lady her name is ...\nAnd and she is a loyal loyal listener every year she makes a donation um

bullpen it was we all of the bullpen and the cubicles right and we had to share the quote drum machine exactly a bed and then you had to walk back to the order to\nOU higher I ran out of you had to write out the tick yes but you had to walk up to the ah oil toilet type the opera and then they had to put it in and I found out about a half hour later what you got the idea that treatment if\nThat soon yeah oh man what a difference now remember the days of guys would come in they smoke cigarettes in front of the bullpen watching the tape or or a library case some of them\nBrought their um their I'm brandy and cognac and\nYou know cigars stink about this how long the trades were the guys on the floor that with a market make is they were making so much money then if you think about it oh just spreads regret that it's not just to spread what all the all the flow you couldn't sit on your computer and trade they it it took so much\nTime for the retail guy put the what is it the institutions that get the auto and they're sitting there going okay oh we got a ... cell here okay we'll just let it come down with salad there will be buying it will get the price and then it'll bounce up and I'll make a you know a big a buck off a million years\nWow now you can get away with that because everyone's trading off the floor and every place else and computerized and you've got the computer trading against you and now you just gotta there to help\nWith the markets the specialists about what they used to be amazing the change has set up a crime\nIt's exciting to talk to people about that over the last ... he's going to be at a few weeks in a bomb on the show so it's great I what a great show off into but I'm Glad to be back I also you're happy I'm back we'll be back next week for your money mad as be happy to be healthy and let's all be profitable [noise]\n\n\nFrom the region will studio your local sushi area where you can well darn calm day and that's the hard radio station [noise]\nAn arms deal between the U.S in Saudi Arabia under scrutiny I'm Pam who's now Fox News\nPresident Trump is promising severe punishment if it turns out that Saudi Arabia is responsible for the disappearance of a Washington Post columnist but the president appears to be stopping short or pulling the plug on an arms deal with the kingdom\nAmerican home for rent was about the biggest that came to Tucson and you know they had purchased around five hundred single family homes in Tucson but like black stone in Phoenix had purchased six thousand back in twenty eleven and twelve they were buying them you know by the you know just in bulk sales\nAnd everybody thought when the market improved they would sell them in and make the profit well instead they secured ties them got more money and they bought off more homes and and you know the the most millennial population is the generation is really having\nA tough time uh with with buying homes because they're chasing a price that's increased um the average cost of a single family home in Tucson has gone up a hundred thousand dollars in the last Seventy two months\nSo six years a hundred thousand dollars and Jerry at today's interest rate what's a hundred thousand dollars cost a homeowner in a payment\nNow I mean you know for every ten thousand dollars you're by you're looking at about sixty bucks so I mean a hundred thousand would be about six hundred dollars right\nSo add that to whatever it was back in in twenty twelve and a six hundred more dollars a month that's a hundred and fifty extra dollars a week\nUm that is coming you know out of your paycheck and\nYou know and it's reached a point where especially the kids coming on to college and have a car payment and student loan debt and they just can't qualify any longer and they're gonna be renting for very long time I mean unless you know some major there is there is upward pressure on wages\nAnd um you know over time people will get their their their loans paid off their student loans it's a ten year payback period um so I guess when they're thirty two years old they can buy a house instead of twenty two\nWell yeah I think there's a lot of demand um I think most fires have 'em they just don't have that they lack the down payment in the lower and they uh they have the income to qualify they just that they lack the down payment which is why downpayment assistance programs are so\nYou know I I'm a you know like the pathway to purchase program is in such demand for that reason but um I think you know it's just that lack of them in Tori is a um I think it's frustrating for for for buyers\nAnd um you know I I uh I'm\nPeople leasing doing you know four to six months leases instead of doing a yearly saying well I'll Try again in February see something different than say I I I Am hearing more frustration\nAnd from a that you know again I'm Talking about the the the hundred to two fifty right right um where we're buyers are getting frustrated with the lack of a mentor is oh heck I'll rent and I'll look at it in the spring and hopefully things are better um\nI don't know you know that um what does that mean for the typical quiet months of November December does that mean they're going to be more ... than normal you know all the time will tell\nBut you know I mean we've got a um so we got some had when we got rising interest rates we have very low and then tore um we did have great demand a but that is a it's a local problem at the national problem and I mean it is what it is\nSo um that's tap our knowledge base in the studio this morning mo Matthews um um he and his wife Kathy own a a company called fresh start and they are also with the XP reality um in in um actually ... my sponsor any XP realty\nBut um what what kind of prices do you have out in Richmond, Virginia\nOr median home price is right about two fifty in Richmond okay a cheaper than I thought yeah [laughter] what what was it at the peak of the market back into time I'll be about three Seventy five to four hundred I Would say Mm hum as well yeah\nOkay and then what about him and tore finding the same shortage of tore\nDefinitely worry right now I'm In most most major counties were we most of our sales occur like in Glen Ellen in Rico county\nRight now um we have probably you know three or about a week's worth of inventory or a number of weeks were [laughter] I mean it's the stuff is good um you know when it hits the multiple listing service it really goes under contract with multiple offers usually within you know the first\nSeventy two hours of right away so it's it's very um\nWe have no ... hardly any inventory um and it's a high demand area a lot of good schools a lot of good neighborhoods so people are flocking into that particular market and then you know all around even in a an outskirts of other areas were still finding low the low inventory as well so\nI'm a market\nSo I'm a model also um owns a and Kathy own home pastors franchise I'm and I'm just kind of curious with the inventory that type of you noticed a downturn in the number of people that are calling with their ugly houses that they don't want to offload\nYeah yeah definitely I mean it's a it's a we're getting I'm less leads but we're the good part is or costs to buy a house still is about the saved so it's harder if we're so basically we're not working as

... years ago when three team leader bombs ...\nGood morning and welcome back I'm In the studio with Jerry son to be a mortgage and uh some friends from Richmond, Virginia\nBut I'm Jerry ... is your go to guy when when it comes to getting a loan and you go to your physician once a year for your annual checkup you really need to have a natural check up on your on your finances and there are several\nListeners of this program who've contacted Jerry\nAnd they have multiple properties and it was you know sure he's got a lot of experience and and you know sometimes it's like well why would I Want to refinance a a three and a half percent loan when when the rates now five and\nWell it might make sense I mean that's the thing of and Jerry will be the first one to tell you if something doesn't make sense and and also come up with creative ways that enclosed deals and\nUh we've got people that are saving over a thousand dollars twelve hundred dollars a month just from restructuring some of the debt they haven't and we had one a dentist\nWho who basically had so many loans to banks want to give 'em any more [laughter] and buddy you have these loans were really mature loans and the pay off on some of these properties was down to forty thousand dollars\nBut he couldn't even refinanced them as long as he had all those loans in place so we ended up having to give him a short term private money alone\nHe paid off several of the homes refinanced several other one's got more equity out ended up paying off a bunch of them now you had room to go buy or more home so um and he wanted to do that before he retired and was unable to you know before he lost his big income\nSo I mean this is the kind of strategy session that you really need to hold\n'em you know about your personal finances for most people their home is the biggest asset that they have ... and and it really makes sense to give jury son to calm and and figure out\nYou know and it's actually starting to slow down some as we come up upon the holidays and it'd be a really good time to look things over and\nIt's anticipated rates are going to continue to rise for at least another year and I'm In the rye sharply actually so this may be a really good time so Jerry what's your phone number of somebody wanted to give you a call on your personal cell phone and talk strategy and make an appointment to come sit down with\nSure my numbers five to zero three seven zero nine five seven six and I'll give you an example of a story that happened just just yesterday and that was a gentleman called me who had not upgraded his home in Fifteen Years\nAnd he has a three point five percent market and um watch they paid the more give him a Fifteen year fixed mortgage and Andy Pettitte down two houses working well north of four hundred thousand got a mortgage about a hundred\nAnd so he wants to pull a hundred thousand dollars to remodel and I and it's like well you do an equity line are we all know equity line right now or five and a quarter the five and a half that prime rib by the end of the year\nAnd most banks are going to be offering you know probably anywhere from primer quarter to a half above prime so that by the end of the year to rate on an act like six percent oh is that the right approach or do you just bite the bullet and refinance and do\nA a a new on even though the rate is basically a point higher from where he is today and it's a tough thing to to to swallow you know it's it it's like I don't want to let go of that that really low rate and you know I I don't know I I didn't have an answer I said these are the options and\nThat's a tough call you have to weigh out\nThe you know the value of having that low rate versus the enjoyment you're going to have a remodeling your home\nRight and also if you do a you know a blended right analysis and basically look at one of the first loan is only Seventy grand and he wants a hundred and it would make sense to get the hundred at the the five percent rate rather than pay six hundred because you know the first position loan doesn't make that big of a difference\nRight right and that's what we're looking at all those analysis and it's just it's a\nThe Mac gets a um I mean you can look and see what's clearly the best from just an analytical standpoint which frankly is from my conclusion was that it wasn't that he should do nothing at all but then why haven't remodel my house and Fifteen Years I mean that I Need a new kitchen I Need new plant says\nThat's what you and that's a intangible thing to\nTo evaluate you know so ... or you know you could just selling moved to a new house that's another option do\nYou know and the values are rising there's this article that came out this week and says where we'll property values rise and fall you one hundred metropolitan areas with the largest populations in the United states are expected\nTo experience a four point five percent appreciation of property value over the next year and that's actually getting better because of everybody's been expecting ten percent for so long of course you know we found by fifty percent so we can afford to do that for a while um but four point five percent is is a national average\nAccording to heroes a real estate solutions and they're less quarterly forecast\nAnd Washington in Nevada\nTopped the list of metropolitan areas\nWith the highest expected appreciation rates Washington having four\nCities in the top and and the Nevada having three ... so I Know Reynosa just going crazy with the with the new Tesla plants mhm and and if you go to Las Vegas from their building that raiders stadium and I mean there are just cranes everywhere I was there for a conference a few weeks ago\nAnd um so I Am so Reno's a rocking at a Las Vegas is is rocking it um Washington I'm In the Seattle area they just about run out of space I mean that they're blocked by by mountains and by ocean and there's not too much more space to to go to but also Colorado\nUtah in Oregon are in the top ten of 'em you know where the property values are going to rise the highest\nAnd then Texas Midland Odessa um are expected to see very healthy rises and of course that's oil country and I'm a College Station where in Texas and M Ms\nAnd then also in San jose California is is um started to see a little bit of a slow down and San jose last year passed a San Francisco for the highest you know median home price in the United states\nThe average person that lives there pays more than one point two million dollars for a home that average Joe at one point to a million dollars or a home so where are the rates falling actually Illinois has um three metropolitan areas that are predicted to lose value", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Home
