military\nHow much you appreciate that is I mean again 'cause we would not be able to Juba jeopardy microphones say the things that I say that make people love me like your love but also at the same time hate me you don't get that and it's okay All right or to the gate a but it's a great job without the military actually fighting for our freedom um we wouldn't have this stuff we wouldn't have this stuff\nThan they did you know that relationship with the military and the YMCA goes back all the way to the civil war I was going to ask\nAbout that how how long have these are really\nIt's over a hundred and fifty years at the Y. is been involved with our nation's military in fact the\nThe YMCA was one of the key part there is to start to us so in the United services organization or that are of course is entertained the military for years and years or a as a or active duty military been deployed overseas and so a lot of that uh\nUh began with the YMCA\nDo you get any any people coming up to you any not military families talking about how much this is actually help them oh you have to get you can you share any any story\nSo um I can uh especially with a much San Antonio experience okay 'cause uh uh ... as a shared a are geared to that I'm prior to coming to serve this community a\nI'm a half years ago in this position here I served actually the YMCA agree to San Antonio for eight years in a in a leadership position there as a cheap develop an officer for the wives\nUm we actually began um this great I'm a similar initiative ... at our YMCAs there in central Texas\nUm and that was a actually a during the early I'm a deployments that happened with the first Gulf mhm and so here we are uh almost Twenty years later\nBut I'm One of those stories that I still remember is being able to share with a family I'm the first time that um they could\nCome and be a part of our YMCA and that that we would covers the entire expense for them to be a part of that and I still remember Garrett or having a conversation with a youngster um who says that we can come for free ... and I still remember the look in their eyes\nOr as a day for the first time came into one of our YMCAs or in San Antonio and ah and ah got on the rock climbing wall and got a chance to be able to uh actually uh uh take advantage of\nThe great childcare facilities that we had there and uh uh just to see that kind of experience and be there Garret this pretty amazed\nLose the stress of knowing that a parent is is off keeping us safe and they're gonna be gone for a year I again I I Can't even I Can't even imagine what that is with that is actually like and then on top that I mean\nIf I ever work event in my wife is staying with the kids are she as something and I have to stay home we get overwhelmed one nights let alone a whole year so it's a big help to the parents and that the the mom or the dad that is still home 'cause you gotta you gotta do things with the kids\nAnd we can't forget that we've got a great a military facilities here or in our local community so Davis mountain Airforce base or a a which we have several branches of the military who serve and who are represented there\nIs a great asset in resource to this community is and uh and it has a tremendous economic impact here\nOr that increases the opportunity for us even as a community\nOr to be able to have great living wage jobs yes and have a great opportunity to be able to stay connected with our military and for Tucson or that's extremely important\nYes it really is I by the way again this is talk of Tucson I'm Garrett Lewis I was the morning show in ... seven Ninety\nWe're here with Tony pen president and CEO of the United way talking about the military ball which will be on and those that pretense at the DCCC you can get tickets the day of lock up where you can plan in advance good at Tucson YMCA dot org slash events\nTo to get the tickets are getting eight people at the table this ceremony up front then there's dinner there's dancing there's there's all kinds of great stuff I'm a great music some rivalries going on between the branch in the military and there's going to be more there as well um you you're expecting over nine hundred people yes\nWorld War two vets is Korean War vets yes Holocaust survivor is yes this is history it is I mean this is humanity right there in the flesh it is that's incredible stuff\nThat is so uh and so uh this is a multigenerational\nEvent also to uh Garrett and that's what's also another thing that's great about that\nOr is that I'm I'm as I've shared with you or my service in the military was uh\nI'm almost forty years ago now\nBut ah do you think about the fact that the ... the ... people right here in our community whose service goes back to uh to be a dumb um and we all know that I'm One of the things that uh we continue to ah try to make up for is the\nThe fact that our Vietnam vets didn't receive the kind of recognition they should have yup often times and and so here's a opportunity to do a little makeup Tucson southern Arizona\nBut also going back to the Korean War and and as we know are there are very very few of those uh veterans who are left who served in the in the world war two imagined being able to sit at a table but we do have a we do have some uh right here\nLike imagine being able to sit at that table and talk to these heroes as that were that that that fought in World War two even the Korean War because I mean it's amazing it's two thousand Eighteen I think the Korean War Vietnam not too long ago in his long time ago like you were saying I Can't it's amazing it's been almost Twenty years\nSince since since we started did you know the long wars in Afghanistan Iraq and I mean it really is incredible um ... again you can actually do this you can get\nA seats at a table and you can be sitting with\nAny of these veterans any of these service members ah from all different generations and and I you know just to hear the story of my my my grandfather one grandfather served in World War two another one of the Korean War skirt and uh yeah yeah God Bless them and and some of the ... they didn't like to talk about it a lot so\nUm but they did share certain therapists they did share certain things\nAre wars their business or ... or the ... the\nThing that I was very aware of when I hit by opportunity is or was that a a there is a actually some peace in strength yes\nI Do enjoy having a strong nations military or being able to defend it or any moment a can also be a um a something that helps to uh maintain the peace yes and that's what that's worth a strong military does for us here\nUm and certainly what are my service was all about was being able to make sure that we maintain that\nBut at the same time are willing to be able to uh make the ultimate sacrifice if necessary for my friends my family and my cup\nI cut from a different ... different collect the peace through strength built uh it it it is true so you have those the um\n[noise] these great veterans and military members in the top of the Holocaust survivors in which the stories and I've talked to several Holocaust survivors and while they're still here I mean it's just in it it it's heartbreaking and it's incredible just to hear these things we need to know that says\nI'm an advantage of living in Tucson and so then Arizona or the and I can see this year because I'm not old is your way a good partner with or or YMCA were also a good partner with the um our local or Jewish or getting\nA federation or when the uh local Jewish foundation and the and the\nThe day as you mentioned it does so we've got a very vibrant a Jewish community here\nUh and uh so it's an advantage for\nFor two so yep yep that we do\nAnd as you mentioned uh I'm there will be some people who will attend to see that a big and also I'm a share stories about why this freedom is so important Oh yes and why are being able to recognize\nOur

Fox News he said Donald Trump supporter suspected of sending a series of pipe bombs to a prominent Democrat a latent\nWe want those first responders to be at the top of their game right trust and we want them to have had a good night's sleep\nWe want the surgeon to not be drinking caffeinated coffee we want them to I'm kidding but we want them to be at their best and first responders\nThink about this they have that obligation inherently they're saying when we roll up on an accident a scene where there's chaos and people's lives are at stake whether you're a police officer an ambulance person an EMT a surgeon\nOr your fighting a war across the country in a in a different country they have to be at their very very best they have to be on cue and so I wanted to say thank you to those

may get a phone call he's been injured he's been hurt we don't want that but you know what when you stop and you think about it so do you think those individuals you see them just take a little five seconds out every day to say thank you to them\nAnd that's what we do it more financial I mean we don't ah you know we're not physically saving lives maybe emotionally and financially we are and

clarion calls the road is out ahead the bridges out ahead\nThis is what our kids and our grandkids are going to face and the question is do you believe the message do you believe this message\nHad a a a gentleman come in last week and he said mark I heard your show and oh my goodness that's why we're here you you make sense you're talking about stuff that matters you know it's not talking about products or interest rates and you know we do eventually get to that whether it's on this show or in a meeting but the point is\nWhat's the message what's the truth well here's an article that says the nets crash will be worse than the great depression show of hands as to how many were alive during the great depression while there was nobody so many people think well how can I even relate to that\nWell you can because this is what the article says it says ten years ago it was too easy credit that brought financial markets to their knees today it could be a global debt folks are you sitting down global debt of two hundred and forty seven trillion\nYes trillion that causes the next crash after a decade of escalating us household debt brought on by low wages and the national debt more than doubling over the same time period to Twenty one trillion\nDebt could sued put the brakes on this economic recovery the analysts warn\nThis gentleman says we think the major economies are on the cost\nOf this turning into the worst recession we have seen in ten years this is what is happening I ran over these numbers last week they bear repeating us household debt of Thirteen point three trillion\nNow exceeds the two thousand and eight Pete\nStudent loans sky rocketed from six hundred and eleven billion to now today one point five trillion so they've doubled auto loans one point two

I'd rather be in Disneyland well yeah exactly I'd rather be in the happiest place on earth\nDisney Land\nYou know I had to bring this a couple of things before we talk about long term care and so forth but thanks again if you're a first time listener appreciate you listening a sticking with us through the break if you are a regular if you're one who's been with us from the very start thank you\nWe like to think that the show has its own kind of culture its own dynamic a way of presenting things and not to scare you but to warn yet and say look\nWe can talk about stuff that really doesn't matter in the long run or we can talk about stuff that really makes a difference you know I I'm a huge proponent of owning permanent life insurance I Am in fact I think one of the only ones certainly on the airwaves let alone\nWhen it comes to talking to people in the office about this I could be wrong on that second one but certainly over the airwaves nobody I I don't think is made the stance that we have made it more on why you want to own whole life insurance\nYeah there's that ... an index that equity indexed often there's term insurance and there is variable life and so forth but permanent whole life insurance\nWe recently delivered a death benefit check and I and I tell people look\nLife insurance is not an investment I don't know if I mentioned this last week or not trust and you can remind me or say Markey already talked about that\nBut nobody has ever asked me when I handed them a death benefit check I go here's a check for five hundred thousand dollars as we did recently nobody has ever asked me nor does did this this wife asked me what the internal rate of return was on the premiums that her husband is paid\nShe she didn't ask me that I've never had anybody asked me that Well Mark I'm trying to really now now that my husband has gone my wife has gone I'm trying to run some numbers to see if actually this was a good purchase\nLet me see premiums paid rate of return cost benefit analysis nobody's ever asked me that they are just so grateful there in tears they're hugging us are going you will never completely understand what this money is going to do and I you know in my heart of hearts on going all I Know exactly what it's going to do it just saved your family from financial ruin\nWhen everybody else is asking for money no of course I don't tell them that but when people are asking everybody else in the world now is asking for money I'm the one we're the ones delivering the tax free death benefit check and holding them and saying you're going to be okay financially\nYes you've just lost your significant other or whoever there is a grieving process but part of that you can now rest assured you now can have peace and confidence knowing that you're OK you are going to be just fine financially\nThat's what permanent whole life insurance does for a family it's not about rate of return now if people want to argue with that comment of will argue with me about what I just said happy to do that you know the really good companies that we work with\nHow does a five percent internal rate of return over the life of a policy sound Well Mark I can get well now this is tax free so you're going to have to add your bracket to that so are you earning between six and a half and seven percent\nIn something that I can guarantee you and I can show you the benefits and the thirty different attributes that a good whole life policy will bring to the table\nThat your other investments maybe have one or two benefits so I'm up for that challenge\nIf you are as well give me a call two nine six four four six four throw the gauntlet down there is there is a challenge that is the weekend challenge mark will go face to face with whatever you're currently in\nAnd I'll compared to permanent whole life insurance\nWhy can I make that claim think about that because I point nine percent of the time I win why\nBecause our planning revolves around the ... of life\nI was listening to an ad on a one of our local stations about another from here in town and they were just talking about rates of return and I go well that's really not a plan and I had a gentleman a actually a husband and wife come in and they and I said so where's your plan I said well here it is and they handed me a brokerage statement and I said well\nSo this is your plan yeah that's our financial advisor this is what he's doing I said well now we don't do wills and trust I I went through the whole gamut a checklist wheels and trust well he doesn't do that life insurance never talked about that disability coverage critical illness long term care we've never discuss any of that so I said\nHe's your financial planner so what we yeah I don't want to be like the politicians and so I'm not going to do that but what I'm going to say is\nWhat we do it more as we take that forty thousand foot view we will put together for you a fully integrated holistic\nComprehensive financial plan we will look at everything affect\nPrior to or even coming in a to do today show I had somebody call me can you believe at this time of day calling me hey I've got this stuff for yet tax returns current long term care policies when I look any happened that he actually stopped by the office I was there to hear upload this I did and I looked\nAt as long term care policy he just got a and this is a great great great company\nUntil I said you know you just gotta rate increase letter here thirty percent the premiums going up by thirty percent\nSo we can help him you know under she gets that so it's not about ready to return it's about do you have a fully integrated comprehensive\nHolistic plan put together so do you live too long die too soon we are the experts at covering the five boroughs of life death disability retirement\nLong term care I'm going to talk about that here and then as well as tax efficiency so he brought his returns as well so when we are done analyzing things we are going to save him a\nA bunch of money and put them in a much better position you know it's great to say yes they do a bunch of money but yeah look at the new the new benefits is like there will down to almost no he's going to walk away he and his wife are going to say oh my goodness you position does better and gave us more benefit for less money\nI go yeah isn't isn't that what we're supposed to be doing and more financial that's that's why we're in business we are here to put you in a better position to position you so when this stuff happens that were just talking about and I had this conversation with him there Bob and their heads of an ongoing yeah we got we got to be prepared for this and you do\nSo please give us a call two nine six four four six four we are here for you this is about you this is not about more so what's the message to the messages\nThe bridge is out ahead the bridges out ahead and people asked", "show_name": "Smart Money

Lopez saying you know I think I'm gonna maybe interested in buying buying this hotel you and I kind of wanted to he gathered about nine different nonprofit ... and said what are you guys think about you know this concept of having an idea\nWell because I'd been doing hope fast for so long and because this is kind of been in my heart you know I was just overwhelmed I'm just like yes let's do it right and everybody else was a little hesitant and just saying oh it's a big project who's going to manage it who's going to do it right and a magic\nJust to run you know the facility I mean it's a big hotel is a job you\nKnow it's a total of a hundred and forty thousand square wow so it has a two hundred and fifty hotel room tower in addition to fifty one one bedroom suite\nUm twelve thousand square feet of ballroom space huge ... one of the premier you know conference hotels and she's on before all the resorts were built right\nUm so anyway um so back to the story or the next phone call we got from him he's just like you know what I bought the hotel and this is what we're going to do and\nSo we were kind of you know full steam ahead you know I kind of describe it to everybody is you know we've been on a bullet train ever since that so um so he got in touch with gospel rescue mission and he had been a longtime donor of gospel rescue mission was familiar with the work that they do\nAnd said you know I Want you to be there with shelter services\nAnd also somebody needed needs to manage the ... or so um so would you also take on the management of the support organizations that are going to be there so I'm so I'm also a part a gospel rescue mission so we said yes we'll do that\nVery happily and um and so that kind of started the journey right um\nWe kicked off the capital campaign 'cause the building is kind of move in ready but we need to make improvements ... building so we kicked off the capital campaign in April of four and a half million dollars and we're already kind of halfway through that so that's going well\nUm so the plan is to have um like I said three hundred and fifty shelter beds available\nFor men and women and women with children some specialty shelter services that nobody in town has like a people with service dogs um respite beds there's so many shelter\nIn town then people show up straight from the hospital that\nAre still in their hospitals and nobody can take them because they still need some kind of medical care so we'll have those beds available in so many different other things will partner together with a\nA kennel that um people that come with with dogs I hadn't actually kennel there pat ... or\nSo we're kind of thinking outside the box them really are really making it um accessible as of right now we already have thirty different organizations that are signed up to do services okay I'm their G.

time of need and we have some precautions you know obviously we don't want anybody to abuse the system I'm so they get a wristband when people come in and the tabs are taken off the wrist bands you

all confirmation vote on Pam who sale Fox News crowds of protesters were on Capitol Hill as the Senate prepares for a final vote on Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination what makes today different is that most demonstrators will be kept outside the only way for\nWho are wheelchair bound and who are dependent upon others to help them and so I asked the question I said Bob at what point did you realize that you had to surrender\nSo that you would then allow other people to help you because you cannot feed yourself you can't shave you can't base\nYou can't do any you are one hundred percent dependent upon people he said mark that was probably one of the hardest days in my life emotionally because I realized that as a guy where the provider where's the protector\nWhere uh where our family hero and I had to now release and surrendered that position to others who now I'm at their mercy\nThey need to help me and everything that I Do and he started tearing up and I as did I was a very emotional we were there about three hours very emotional\nTime and just as\nPresidential or as serendipitous as it was the doctor who was responsible for putting this whole organization\nTogether across the country just happen to show up\nAnd we used my brother and I spend about forty five minutes talking with him and interviewing him and again this is going to going to be in an upcoming show that we're doing uh probably over these airwaves but\nHe had just lost his wife a couple of months ago and so this organization here he was one who founded and heads it up and spearhead things all across the country\nIs is so much a part of his life had not been for this\nHis wife was going to be emotionally drastically altered so\nI say all that to say this let's put everything in perspective here when we left everybody was high fiving us and shaking our hands and smiling from cheek the cheek and they were all in wheelchairs yet they have\nOf the the perspective of you know what there are other people that perhaps are and worst positions than I Am and wow my life\nWill never ever be the same after that interview where we again we spent three hours there and so I wanted to salute to those individuals at the Sacramento the greater Sacramento multiple sclerosis achievements Center for changing my life\nImpacted my life in such a way where it will never be the same I Want to read I Want to read you something\nPerhaps you're struggling with your lot in life I'm Wondering where you're at and what life is all about what's at all about how the an okay Allen sing that song interest in going thank goodness I Want to read something here and uh\nIt's something I pulled out of my my files I thought this was really interesting it says that the heart of working men and women everywhere is the longing the often forgotten and sadly disparity of to participate in something greater than themselves to belong to a cause that is meaningful\nAnd to share in a legacy that indoors and that certainly speaks\nTo the point of the multiple sclerosis achievement center\nIn order to achieve personal mastery one must first achieve clarity and to achieve clarity most often requires an outside influence someone who can pull you out of yourself so that you can more readily see yourself\nSomeone who can challenge their assumptions your belief the habits that determine what you do in reaction to what happens to you the opinion to hold the walls you set up to keep your life comfortable\nOn threatened unchallenged is that you\nAnd then finally there is a book called the strange life\nOf Ivan ... and the author says that reincarnation is not what we have been led to think it is that we are not reborn as someone else but rather that we were reborn to relive exactly the same life we've lived over and over again\nUntil we make a significant choice to do something different than we've done life afterlife so in order for things to change you\nMust change first then that said ways right into what we do it more financial strategies perhaps you're listening to the shows they mark what in the world\nDoes all this has to do with retirement planning it has to do with what we talked about oh probably a month ago where I made the comment that some people almost picked up the phone and called us some individuals almost\nCompleted the application process when we show them that this was a great strategy they almost had a plan put together by the professionals at more financial strategy to say almost\nDid it but you know what they never did so in order for things to change you must change you must pick up the phone you must say today is the day\nThings are going to change financially for me and my family\nI'm going to draw the line in the Santa going to pick up the phone Mark's been talking about having the ideal planned for many months many moon many a year\nNow is the time\nAnd some folks I can relate we all have things in our lives where we look back and we have great regret\nWhy didn't I Do this sooner why didn't I Do this one I had the opportunity today all of that can change if you simply pick up the phone give us a call call me on my cell phone two three five\nNine for six five again two three five nine for six five there are three phases that\nYou have to go through before changed takes place number one is you're just embarrass perhaps

this zero life insurance I don't own any long term care insurance I haven't put a will or a trust together\nTrust and you're looking at me like you're checking those things off that you are right okay so you're embarrassed\nThen you get your progress in the next stage where you just fed up you say you know what I've heard this show Martin keeps talking about a plan he keeps talking about insurances eats keeps talking about having a road map that smart money master plan boy I'm just I've had it up here I Need to do something\nWell that would be face to you're just fed up you're ready but you're quite that haven't quite picked up the phone yet to make that call will do that even right now during the show two nine six four four\nSix for the final stages years absolutely disgusted you just said I I'm this is it I hate where I'm at its it's like where people who say yeah that's it I I Want to lose weight I got to put that doughnut down\nI got to put down that pizza that fifteenth slice of pizza I just\nI I'm I'm disgusted with where we are financially\nThere is no time better than the president take down the review mirror pick up the phone give us a call we are here to help you we are here to serve you you know not everything that you hear on the radio is true\nBut one of the things that is true is that in order to change you must change first don't expect to others to change\nYou pick up the phone you give us a call you set the appointment you come in you tell us your story you walk away with great information great articles perhaps you can walk away with the optimize their package\nTom ... book which we will give to you after you come in to twenty five dollar value twenty nine something like that I got my hands here\nBut is it something like that twenty four Ninety five

accidents you're going to stop your toe you're going to yes exactly yeah and this and there you go to the border looking at there they're looking at their cell phones they're oblivious to everything

first part of the show here in fact I wanted to mention this was talking about the multiple sclerosis achievement center and they take those people on field trips they go bowling\nThey go ice skating

get anywhere else that are probably lightly used and totally good condition the kind of spreads all of a little bit\nYou'd probably get a lot of homeless donate as well right helmets\nYeah how much does and then you gotta be careful because if you crash and once they're done right and so that's a big it's\nA big deal donate like because I'm not I don't know anything about bicycling but do people like are there certain types of shoes that are encouraged to to where when biking or going to be just whatever you want to live\nSo they're very fancy all kinds of different oh they're all ... and ... and I wear my toes and my Congress you can wear whatever you want and\nThat's the beauty of a bicycle right but ah as you progress yeah there's advantages but uh we always start kids off on flat pedals your normal shoes sort of thing and then they might progressed to clip the titles sort of thing\nAnd speaking of progressing so you watch kids you've been doing this ... been around for Fifteen Years you've been watching kids kind of grow up yeah throughout Tucson so now you have these adult yeah we're in when you founded al ... have you seen them still be into by bike riding or coming back to the organization to give back\nWell funny you ask because half of my Thirteen people on staff or alumni right so the kids that came to the program they get it they know what it is they know what it means to be impacted by a quality men during their life\nAnd that's really what it's about right people who care um and help them stay on the right path now they're doing that for the next generation so it's amazing right um I've got alumni who volunteer ah I've got alumni on the board I've got you know just alumni all over the place and so it's a really good feeling\nAnd this all started again and you're in your backyard yeah I mean isn't that kind of cool to see something in infancy stage just grow to where it's at right now and you're still could still young it it's going to have all plenty over the years Willie ... and your husband is involved in it as well rats\nYeah so yeah so he's the head coach of hey I'll group a and I'm more\nOf like the program director right and so it's exciting you know we we've already surpassed what our vision maybe may have been when we were you know twenty five years old and like let's ride bikes with kids and now it's just this wonderful community entity that continues to grow and\nAnd change him talking with Ben yellowish co founder and executive director of a group I mean this is what I'm looking at your ... we have a nine year old idea of an excuse the coolest bike ride right now [laughter]\nHe's pretty your ad and right and\nSo he is don't tell anybody but ah he's not old enough to ride with email group of but he's certainly strong enough so he rides and the ... group of chemo group with high schoolers I was just where his ability is is kind of grown up on\nA bike I mean obviously yeah and the nature of his parents absolutely no break down a little bit so there is ... what's the age range of that and then what are the kind of an age ranges beyond yeah as a team\nOf group is roughly twelve to Eighteen so your upper middle school high school age kids boys and girls um\nRepeat though is seven to Thirteen noble element upper elementary and ah and lower middle school and then uh we just started group pet do um because we didn't have enough going on but uh we\nWe recognize that there were kids that don't gravitate towards the competitive side of cycling and and still wanted to have goals studying so their focus um and this is more than that twelve to Fifteen year old their focus is bike packing which does\nCamping on your bicycle so bike touring but now with new technology you can do everything on mountain bike so he just won their first trip uh last weekend and they rode from the clubhouse downtown two colossal cave I'm far but they did it mostly on dirt\nAnd Thirteen miles a single track and they carry their tent and they're sleeping bag and they're closing their food in their ... cooking gear and camped out there and then wrote back the next day so we're we're looking and really excited to do a lot more of that\nAnd that's like such a foundational memory that they'll carry with them for forever absolutely absolutely and it was all of this we have to talk about safety a little bit yeah you're riding a bike you got your helmet on on the streets you know there's enough at risk with potholes in traffic but also a mountain biking you can get seriously hurt how are you keeping these kids safe\nYeah well I mean we focus on skills skills skills right so it's about not taking a kid to something and they're not ready for they've practice these skills over and over and over again right and then we've got qualified you know staff and volunteer coaches they go out we have at least the one to five ratio of adults to kids\nOn um teenage group known as they get younger we that ratio goes up so we go one to two one two three and repeat so um we're always looking for more quality volunteers ... help a service mentors and assist the main coaches especially with mountain bike skills so people are out there were looking for um\nDo I bet you are absolutely well you know speaking of like we were kids coming in and speaking of diversity and all that where are you seeing like demographic wise what parts of town and where are you seeing the most out you know with the gravitate towards a group of ... where they coming from what parts of town\nA lot of our growth has been word of mouth and so um what we've tried to do over the years is be intentional or about diversity and where we're doing outreach so I mentioned the ... bike club that's intentional it's down the street from us is west side barrio Hollywood right these are target audience kids that like should be ride and\nSchool and we want to have now that we exist and so we targeted there we've done a lot of work with the boys and Girls Club we've done a lot of girls empowerment workshops with those girls are again west side stuff just down the street from us I'm the outreach that we do we try to make sure that we're working with kids that wouldn't otherwise have opportunity so that\nYou get kids from all sides of town but we're also really working to attract kids wouldn't otherwise no\nNot in that specific region to so it's like bike friendly in that area actually\nYeah and so one of the cool things that we've been all over the last year is partnerships with a ...\nCommunities of refugee families um and so we've got an apartment complex on the left side just a mile and a half from us that we pick up kids from their highly complex and take them back to participate and repeat though this summer by camp we had each week we were going to different locations are picking up kids it really wouldn't be able to get to us otherwise\nAnd with these kids you're doing this you keep saying goal setting goals set a goal setting are you timing these kids are the ones that are trying to be competitive to teach them how to increase their time or how are you what are the goal studying what

until the end and so if you have yet to experience the more difference please do give us a call two nine six four four six four to nine six four four six four\nWell I only have twenty two minutes twenty two and a half minutes to tell you so much that probably ... hours and hours and hours of stuff here but you know part of what we do I talked to before the the little break about life insurance and annuities and\nLong term care and so forth many people look at what we do and they try and they trying couch it in the environment of an investment\nThey say Well Mark why would I put money into a whole life insurance policy when I could take those same dollars and put those into the market\nYou know that's a really good observation that's a great question or why would they take those same dollars and put them into an annuity when I could put them\nInto something else where I could earn more money and the reality is you know what you really need to stop applying I'm going to be gentle here you need to stop applying gentle mark okay you need to stop applying the investment mentality to a risk transfer instrument\nYou to to give you peace of mind to let you know that what we just mentioned the things I just kinda rattle off the life insurance long term care\nAnd annuities they are primarily risk transfer devices risk transfer instrument they are not investments look\nYou'll you'll probably all agree that we ensure our homes our automobiles because their last would be difficult right it would be a um unanticipated hardship on us\nBut do you the listener when you\nSend those premium dollars into cover the car and the auto or your things like your cell phone or think about when you go buy tires you'll buy insurance in case\nYou get an era terrible\nThe damage to your tired your sample of yeah I pay for all that stuff because their loss would create some type of a hardship but do you expect a return on investment for those premium dollars that you put towards those instruments\nWill typically know\nThirty forty fifty years go by even making that\nHomeowners insurance payment for the case you're fired case you fire and keep your house gets burned down or there's water damage and you never ever had a claim you don't think to yourself wow I Wonder if they're going to send me a check with interest for all that money I invested in those things well we don't think that way so what what\nMy encouragement to you today is don't look at what we do necessarily as can I make money now I'm going to tell you out of the other side of my mouth\nThat if you purchased the right type of life insurance and you manage it actively like you do other investments so if if it if it's properly structure and actively managed like other things you have in many ways it can look and feel and smell and pass a taste test when it comes to is this an investment\nWell life insurance can be many things it's it's like what we call the Swiss army knife of different instruments that are out there in the marketplace yes at the end of the day if somebody passes away which we've had four or five upwards of ten people pass away this year so far\nIt acts like it should act and that is it pays a death benefit and you know not one\nTime not one time ever and I've been doing this almost twenty five years has anybody ever asked me Mart I got this death benefit check what was the rate of return on all the premiums that my husband or my my wife spent on this nobody's ever asked me that\nThey've always asked me are we going to be okay is this enough what do we do with this money now this is my spouse in spend double form how do I make sure I protect is moving forward that's what they always ask 'cause they don't ask if they don't sit Denmark and you run a quick calculation as the the rate of return\nOn the premium dollars spent and now the death benefit nobody's ever asked me that\nSo when you look at the things that we do it more financial when we engage with you and we have that very real ... robust conversation about permanent life insurance and again I go back to what I said the very beginning of the show I put our reputation\nOur longevity at risk here by talking about the things that very few other advisers certainly over the airwaves talk about let alone in their office when it comes to properly positioning life insurance\nAcid base long term care coverages and annuities in the light of you either living too long passing away too soon ending up in a facility\nOr some type\nRates of return all of a sudden do become that important what does become important or things like am I going to be OK is my family going to be\nOkay because life happens and you want\nTo make sure you have done the very best job possible when it comes to ensuring your life there are many people will say now mark you look I've heard this a whole life insurance I shouldn't ... I've heard bad things about it I Googled it it says it's a lousy investment it's a horrible well what I say about ten minutes ago was", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Smart Money Moves by Moore

before we talk about um rotary overall do you want to talk to touch base on our sponsors maybe just a little bit more what I what are we just wrap up because we have wonderful sponsor\nYeah actually it was funny I was just thinking about that that we hadn't talked about it and you know I mean the the real jump in our our ability to raise the type of money that we have been able to raise\nReally has come due to our sponsors um we've had our our headline sponsor which um has been for the last I Believe this is five years or title sponsor is we buy houses\nWhich uh you know a local business owner but he has been he and his family have been a major major sponsors for the past five years but\nWe have a lot of key sponsors in here that uh their contributions were at at the you know a five thousand dollar level\nUm people have stepped in Arizona Bowl beach flash men say more U.S ... uh Larry Miller\nBad media a rich and Judy Flynn Supercuts the temp connection and well spring's financial partners um we have a number of uh supporting sponsors we have all different sponsorship levels um and you know maybe just a\nA quick plug about sponsorships is obviously we're we're too late in the game as far as this year um but obviously the more sponsors that we're able to get involved with the car show is is the more that we're able to contribute to our charities so\nIf anybody um you know is listening to this and they're thinking hey this is the type of organization that I'd like to you know get involved with to be able to get back to the community um\nAgain I probably would direct people to the website and um you know we certainly would love to welcome in some new sponsors next year for ah for our ... our thirteenth a annual\nCar show for us the more the merrier ... you had them or you can give a hundred percent now now what what's that same shop give local I shop I don't give local or something like that well right now you want to give local because it stays local\nAfter I go yeah absolutely and it and you know the studies show that dollars it stay local go round like seven times were dollars that come in whatever it is they go out of state someplace to a bigger company they don't circulate here in Maine so it's good for all of us\nUm but so rotary um what is the Rotary Club and and what's that about I mean we used used to talk about Rotary Club is being a service organization organization of of business leaders a community leaders are and just people who really want to be engaged in the community and others that service organization has members\nWhat's really changed the years is we're really now a membership organization that focuses on our members and their development and what they can do a and and the service that we can do through that so rotary has an international an organization or their one point two million numbers worldwide we're in over two hundred where it almost every country in the world\nUh I just came back ah four months ago from the international conference convention in Toronto we\nGet together once a year or early ... oh yeah thirty five thousand people and we were yeah thirty five thousand type a good do gooders\n[laughter] [laughter] that's my own area cage I don't know what to do it right but everybody\nEverybody looking to do good and and probably where I Hope people recognize rotary most is that a rotary in the late Nineteen eighties made a commitment\nTo eradicate polio so at that point in time it's hard for us in the United states thing about it I'm I'm old enough I'm sixty now and uh I had a friend that I knew in in middle school who had had polio and it's a it's a terrible disease and and back in the late eighties\nUm three hundred and fifty thousand people worldwide died\nBased on polio and countless others were were crippled and um and so a rotary made a commitment late Nineteen eighties and since that point in time we've contributed a billions of dollars and we'd immunized to point seven billion children ... billion July\nAnd we are this close my fingers to get ahead ant really see him but I was like yeah we had there were seven teen cases\nIn the world last year Seventeen and they're all into countries there in Pakistan and Afghanistan ... uh but uh but was the bill Gates Foundation has gotten involved and given a lot of money working with us as well and uh it would be the second disease in history of the world\nBeing the first to be eradicated so serene\nRotary that's our main mission is to make sure that happens and once they are no cases we have to go three years without there being a case to say that the polio is racket yeah so I mean you can donate to the Rotary Club of Tucson we do things locally and rotary has a club based organization that has clubs everywhere\nBut we also are an international organization that tackles a tough issues so\nThere's a lot of talk okay if polio is is not your what's our next thing we're doing\nThat is true because you always have to be one step at a game where they had and\nIt looks like that might be water so for instance the er very rats and who is the\nThe the president of the international Rotary Club a and made a commitment this year in Toronto that um\nWe're going to focus on eradicating or or or or or or basically delivering freshwater hot water to everybody in Haiti\nSo any country has been really in ... was world but he made a commitment this year there that within a a window of time we're going to have a water for everybody in the country of Oman down if not all that other big problems and other places but I\nJust want to mention real quick jumping back to polio and and I'll have to defer to you because I I Know that you will recall a little bit more of the history and the type of uh funds that had been raised as a result of wrote ... becoming involved a in eradicating it\nDue to the Tour de Tucson is I saw there was one of our um members he subsequently had passed away some years ago\nUm but be became involved as far as what the tour to Tucson and so we have many people well\nThe president of rotary international became involved and it just has totally taken it to a different level so maybe if you might want to just touch on that as well\nAbsolutely so I'm Mike Harris who was a member of a a ... job is in town and his wife Charlotte Harris is an art club Mike started is a great great guy who passed away a number of years ago here about five years ago six years ago I think\nUh but um through that affiliation with el ... to Tucson I think forty two million dollars locally has been raised\nJust through that to support the polio eradication last year the number was about twelve million dollars in part of that is because John Hugo the international chairman of rotary international him he's a big bike rider mad so I mean where we get sponsored by people I think he get sponsored by countries\nRight anyway [laughter] he's all guys from one match\nWith the gates foundation um but but you know deterred from rotary international local our club now we're up to two hundred and forty four members and it's the largest Rotary Club in the state of Arizona where the the sixty third largest Rotary Club in the world out of thirty six thousand clubs\nAnd um we do a lot locally but are seen as your event is the main thing but we do everything from salvation bell ringing to working with the the circle why\nUh on their triangle why camp to working with the boy scouts up on Mount Lemmon or to do in a you know community food drives and working at the community uh food food bank and so we work in a lot of different ways locally\nUh and we're blessed to have a great organization and great members that allow us to do something like the Tucson classics car show and I make a difference in this community and to be able to give back one point two million through that were to organize and worked with you know an alternative Tucson and that is now the largest fundraising for ... that they've ever done\nThrough this is Adam linked to polio so yeah and and the Rotary Club well gentleman\nTwelfth Daniel Tucson classics car sales Saturday October twentieth ten AM to for the Gregory school for more information Tucson classics car show dot com\nAnd I want to thank you so much for everything that you do for our community and

Soldiers were lost\nBut when you can connect\nWith an actual name of somebody\nThat really gives credence to the value of their life and what they did\nTo give it all for your freedom and for my freedom so medal of honor\nDot ORG go to that website and so the ... the founder of this organization a gal and her husband her name is Amy caught a I Believe or code SCOTT a it's probably pronounced quota [noise]\nShe began running in combat boots in two thousand eleven after her then Eighteen year old son left for the marine corps boot camp\nAfter competing in endurance event wearing boots Amy discovered it could be a way to honor our fallen military and showing their families\nThat they're not alone so their mission statement reads as follows honor our fallen military and their families they leave behind through and Durant sports and special events in order to help heal the visible and the invisible wounds of war for for both surviving family members\nAnd veterans and so how do they come up with a name medals of honor it was named for the symbolic act of sacrificing ones endure ins or sports participation metal in honor and memory of a fallen service member who paid the ultimate price for our freedom\nMission first their philosophy our mission and those we serve is our number one priority do no harm this is interesting they say we don't want your money we want your metal and your participation so go to that website medals of honor dot org\nAnd I want to read just a little caption here I thought this was very fascinating as I scroll through the pages here as a way to remember\nAnd it says here our biggest fear as a gold star family is that our son Ben will be forgotten having had someone race in memory of him was very healing to our family to us it signified that ... others appreciated his service and he was just not another number\nAnother name and not only help keep his memory alive but truly honor the sacrifice he made for our country\nI Know he would have been so proud and this is from Brenda gearheart proud gold star mom of lieutenant corporal Benjamin age gearheart who gave his life so\nThe more the more you read the more you know the more you find out about these organizations who are making a difference in the hearts and the lives of people who\nFor our freedom lay down their lives so we applaud that organization today for all that they are doing\nIt's our commitment as well are are we making that ultimate sacrifice no we can't even come close or even fathom what that's like but we maybe have a a small taste of that each and every day at more where we sometimes have to ask the really difficult questions we have to bring people face to face with what they're doing with their finances\nAnd how they can make it through a world that we think is going to become more time passed us and\nA harder when it comes to where we're going economically some of the things that we are doing and this is exciting for us to share is or the book the power of zero\nAnd uh I was talking to somebody earlier earlier you know when a zero good will zero good zero is good in situations where hey I paid zero in federal income tax write trust and that would that would be pretty exciting\nRight I paid zero I paid zero in state tax or hey I bought something I bought mark one of those ... that you have been talking about for the last couple of years and gosh darn there was no cost there was no fee there was no spread it was\nFree I gave them my money and all that money went right to work in fact they gave me a bonus for giving them money so when is zero good you know that's always fun to talk about but\nWhat's been very exciting for us and we just found this out last week in fact I was privileged to watch the documentary version of the book the power of zero\nAuthor David make night had partnered with a a a director and they'd be actually I I Believe the the director actually came to him and said we need to make your book into a movie and so what they did it's about Seventy five minutes is a documentary we are going to be hosting\nThis movie in theaters in around the Tucson area\nOf amber in December we're just now getting all of that together but we will certainly be talking about it on the show because after watching it\nNow we've been saying this for many many a moon but the financial sooner army is coming and so the movie talks too noble laureates economic\nProfessors people with PHD's people that have all these credentials after their names the people who are in\nThe know as to where we're going as an economy\nAnd what this means to our kids and our grandkids so this movie is very riveting it will bring you in some instances\nTo tears not so much from sadness but probably in anger\nAs to what Congress has failed to do for the last twenty thirty forty years where it's really been all about them\nAnd not about where we are going as an economy so the power of zero has been made into a movie and we will be telling you giving you more details over the ensuing weeks and months as we roll this out we're going to also be getting\nIt in Blu ray DVD form so you'll be able to check them out like a library book be able to come to our office watch it on your own terms give you about a week or so to do that then return 'em that movie to us\n[noise] probably give you a bag of popcorn to pop as well you know do something you have some fun with this but the point is and we're going to be talking about this today at great length is probably going to continue on to next week but here's a little here's a little trivia\nAs suggests we're we're going as an economy folks if you did not know this the number that the congressional budget office throws out there\nIn terms of our national debt they say it's Trump twenty\nTrillion dollars so trust in my faithful man behind the bullet proof\nGlass over there I I like to have you do a little have a little fun here with me if you you can ... part three is where you're going to be jumping in answering this but what's a uh a million dollars if you had a dollar and perhaps you use a listener you've heard this before but\nJust bear with me and uh we'll going to go through this have you had a dollar every second that you were spending how long would it take you to reach a million dollars well the answer is\nEleven days so a dollar a second you'd reach a million dollars in eleven days to reach a billion dollars you spend a dollar a second how long would it take you to get to a billion dollars thirty two years\nSo you wouldn't you wouldn't think that you go by eleven days yeah you know maybe a couple of years or thirty two years but here's the real staggering one person I Want you to jump in on this and I'm going to give you a clue be totally outrageous with may be totally beyond the ... the scope of what you would even think rationally\nTo get to a trillion dollars a dollar a second how long would it take you I Want to guess probably around thirty two thousand days dude you're off for years here yeah how did you know that well simple math\nThirty two days oh my ... you know what I was in ... you had or you have changed my opinion of all the millennials are you are\nIncredibly smart trash bin you are absolutely right a dollar a second how long would it take you to get to a trillion dollars thirty two thousand years\nThe government says we're ... trillion in debt truth be told we're a hundred and twenty trillion in debt\nI'm looking at the U.S debt clock that or are you getting ... you know it but that's wrong because they're they're not doing present day evaluation for Social Security Medicare Medicaid unfunded liabilities that's what they're\nMissing and so the question is to you the listener if this is true which I Believe it is true and this movie says it it's true and this is where I get really passionate what are you going to do about it how can you save\nFox News I'm Karen McHugh President Trump tells CBS or sixty minutes Saudi Arabia will be held responsible if they were involved in the disappearance of journalists ...\nThere's a lot at stake and [noise] maybe especially so because this man was a reporter there's something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to see\nWhat's going to get to the bottom of it and they will be severe punish\nCourtesy Fox and friends ... disappeared in Turkey was last seen October second Florida Georgia ravaged by hurricane Michael we'll get a visit from the president next week\nPresident Trump

have regular so maybe I Need to switch all to do\nI don't know but you can tell we're excited about this it's an opportunity for us\nIf you listen to the first portion of our show to make a difference in your life is is votes this is not a popular message it's certainly not popular when it comes to being a politician and trying to get reelected when you when you're going to tell your constituency you know one as a government are we really need to tighten the belt we need to cut back on this when you to come back on that we need to\nReduce benefits on Medicaid uh you don't want him for ... you realize one in four Americans are on Medicaid right now\nIn New York City alone one and three see the Math Doesn't why we have to tighten our belts but a Congress refuses to do that because it's not popular it's called gridlock they're not going to do this\nSo as I said earlier the biggest threat to our national security is our national debt\nAnd this and and the numbers are scary but again back to Congress they're not going to you're not going to hear your local politician or or ... senators representatives say look we are going to go in and a reduced Social Security we're going to do this we're gonna do it at the end it's not popular it doesn't get them re elected well you know what medical hogwash with our [laughter]\nOur elected officials it really is as I said in the beginning of the show it's about\nYou it's about you and it's about your kids and your grandkids and as David Walker talks about in the movie\nThe power is zero that this is morally unacceptable what our government has done and continue to do\nAnd you know what in two years our deficit is going to be a trillion dollars and what does that mean it means that worked at we're taking in a trillion less than while we're standing look if we ran our household like the government runs there's we'd be bankrupt right and so this is happening\nThey say that just the interest costs on the national debt debt will cost more than what we're spending on the military\nAgain the numbers don't lie and you go to yes you go to what a tourist and pulled up us debt clock dot org and talk about sobering there yeah that's really scary so what the what the economists look at they look at what we call the debt to GDP ratio and GDP is uh the gross domestic product\nOr they look at the deficit to the GDP ratio\nSo what are they saying that the experts are saying again experts they're not politicians to the people who are in the no say we have a crisis on our hands because what is the government doing there they are renting\nThis money thing about when you go to the store and you put money on a credit card you're renting that money right but at some point\n... you you got the first answer right so at some point when you get your bill what do you have to do\nThat was hey yeah thank you this is really difficult this is like econ one oh one\nYou have to pay it exactly so we our mortgage you think about it we are mortgaging ourselves to foreign countries why is because foreign countries he used to be that we would want to buy us savings bonds because look we're we're helping the growth of America well now we have foreign countries coming in\nBuying our bonds and this could lead to a crisis as well what we call the sovereign debt crisis so we keep raising this thing called the debt ceiling\nAnd we cut taxes so think about that we're raising how much we're renting how much debt we want to create and at the same time cutting taxes isn't that a\nOf a formula for failure I Would contend yes it is so what does the government do all their solution is uh get those printing presses started ... return to their the printing their print they're printing money so it's something called the fiscal gap you can read about it you can Google it\nTwenty trillion know try to hundred trillion dollars and it's growing this fiscal gap folks is growing at a rate of six trillion dollars a year\nThey say we can solve this if we have the GDP grows up between ten and Fifteen Percent a year well right now they're applauding our government Trump whoever if we grow at three percent well they say in order for us to solve this problem and needs to grow between ten and Fifteen\nPercent is that realistic I Would say no ten to Fifteen Percent growth no that's not going to happen\nSo we have to dramatically increase revenue again that would be through that ten to Fifteen Percent we have to cut spending which that makes sense and we have to increase tax rates and as I said this is not politically\nThe way people want to go but it's the hard and fast facts that yes we have\nTo do this so\nWe talk about numbers we talked about different things you know there are people out there that are Sam artifice is hogwash isn't isn't going to happen but we have folks I my contention is we have the next eight years to do something\nAnd I want you to just now if you have yet to call us because time flies trust and what was a little comment you made before we went on the show today about global warming tell our listening audience about that well we don't do something in the next\nUh twelve years climatologists are saying that we need to do something about global warming and twelve years or else it's going to be the worst ...\nYes horrific everything's going to happen the melting ice caps the the decline of the seashore is the ... all of that right the humpback whale or whatever\nWell the same message holds true for economically and I use this word a lot today contention my contention is it's going to be all that that's going to be more of a crisis than global warming\nBecause\nI don't think there's really a solution to global warming everybody stops driving everybody starts stopped breathing everybody stopped eating ... that was all the ... well that's not going to happen\nYou know this whole carbon thing is that really ... what what can we do but you can make an impact on this kind of stuff so we have folks we have eight years for you to make a difference to pay the taxes the day when they are historically low\nAnd then put that money in the vehicles that will never ever ever ever ever that's for Evers require income taxation on that money ever again you know there are people that are saying oh we need to have guaranteed income for all Americans\nWe ran the numbers trust you could probably do this in your head you are a math whiz or a mad guru ten thousand dollars per person would be\nThree point four trillion dollars where are we going to come up with that money if everybody said oh we you know health care free for all the let's wipe away all the student debt let's do this let's do that well look folks the current budget of the U.S government is currently around four point two trillion dollars that's the current budget so what's the deficit\nThe deficit is we're not bringing we're bringing in a million less than a trillion I'm Sorry we are bringing in a trillion lesson that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Smart Money Moves by Moore Financial Strategies", "city": "Tucson", "day": "13", "locations": [["Arizona Bowl", 33.51893,
