a little bit about uh the Unabomber and Rudolph about what he did both of them did let their bombings\nCan you tell us a little bit about how they relate to each other and I think the guy in Florida is probably going to be added to that list\nOn your Roger it I think you will be there are loners um they have their own agenda they\nWant to impress upon their public or their point of view and the way they go about her just blowing things up to get attention they wouldn't have done a and Eric Rudolph case um after and set off a\nTwo bombs going through people and injuring if they're not a burden or hundreds of others that I'm director Louis Freeh at the time so they don't want this guy I don't want him at all costs so I don't want him to breathe have time to stop have time to rest have time to make another bomb\nAnd so we turn to all the FBI resources we head into tracking down Eric Rudolph um he\nWas loose if you go off and land than towards planes anybody um\nIs that unusual don't they usually have a confidante someplace that they say something\nTo uh some do but and again and he was operating in North Carolina words ... law enforcement's not really popular in some places certainly in the back woods are so even if somebody had seen him they would have protected embryo probably they wouldn't said anything 'cause yeah when we get involved\nIn that could you describe but what he what he was going for what he was supporting and what his message was 'cause some people may not know that\n\nYeah he was a [laughter] you targeted or abortion clinics and uh\nOne of them stopped shut down and they didn't do it and boom up a so that was his goal I don't think he would have to run for five years but he he was one of the rest of them I used to refer\nTo thousands three um by a police officer Julius possible and they caught him running through trash\nOr this angry pardon me he was hungry he was okay I get it lost a lot of weight\nOr from pictures we had um but he still recognizable as Eric Rudolph a on things you had in common with the Unabomber a Unabomber isolate themselves totally from civilization um\nOne ... one room did he built that or was that a family thing I don't\nI think he built it um and he didn't go out and buy a all components for his mommy took scraps fear and scraps there and his intent was to kill me uh he won a technology stopped

these these protesters are as a as they make their voices heard is Murkowski Lisa Murkowski not voting will want to hear this\n\n... and I think she just voted present on memory gave a lot of the parliamentary I'm signaling nation that we expected but again the idea of Lisa Murkowski pairing her vote\nOr was that she would um uh allow your deference to her colleague um\n... the Republican from from a Montana who has been a strong supporter of of the confirmation of a ...\nMr rich\nVote tally now stands at third round the thirty five it will take a simple majority for confirmation of bread around [noise]\nWhich are Rubio [noise]\nI'm not sure John decker if you've heard the interview with Mitch McConnell on a Fox News channel a little bit before the Senate but he suggested that he and the president had talked an awful lot after that second hearing and never wavered on on their ... um supportive of Brett Kavanaugh um there was no talk between him and the president he set of\nOf pulling the nomination I assume that's pretty consistent with your reporting with how the White House has handled this show very unique nomination nominee\nThat's right the White House digging in its heals over Brett Kavanaugh over the course of the past if you got even a one at times over the course of the past the will of his nomination was in doubt I was outside during a for the president's departure when that interview was played on Fox News channel but you may know\nThat Senator McConnell gave an interview as well to the Washington Post I read that interview and in that interview he again reiterated that at no time were you any doubt that they would stick with Brett Kavanaugh as their nominee Van Hollen [noise]\nEr Chris Van Hollen of Maryland a casting his votes is Warren\nWas the Warren of Massachusetts the White House prices are no votes um we're waiting for for the wicker\nNumber here to to reach a majority simple ... with Ninety nine senators voting as we expect with her youngest the Kavanaugh sitting at forty nine right now\nThe vice president presiding over the United States Senate\n\nAnd that should be my vote and Montana\nAgain is ... is more dire gambling al ... [noise]\nWe'll see where president ...\nHe would have voted I\nI had voted no\nRepair will not change the outcome is out there for withdrawing I thought\nThe senator has that right\n\nSenators voting in the affirmative Alexander ...\nThrough the tally you had heard the explanation fire from law Murkowski or a Republican from Alaska explaining that you've ... the Republican ... from Montana or where president he would have voted yet\nAnd already grant is opposed they would vote no but you allow a his vote to count I without him being here because it does not count\nShe is voting present and made that announcement and you heard the virus in and say the senator has that right that is something that does not happen very often in the United States Senate a marine used to be a tradition that was more frequently than it is\nA recently called airing a ... vote I Believe the last time it happened was was ... fourteen and it is a ... when you have senator sometimes of the same party sometimes of different parties that are on two different ends of the vote and\nFor one reason or another Senate or can't be there and and they find a partner to to pair with two are not change the outcome in any meaningful way and that is what we just saw him as you made the earlier point John\nUm it is a sense of of comedy a sense of unity that is the explanation that land Murkowski gave last night when she explained that she was going to do this threat Ryan\nAt least bit by bit or store um some of the the the ... nature of the United States Senate has really been tested over the last few weeks of his nomination\nWill keep in mind that leads you'll nature maybe back to where it needs to be on the Republican side I don't think it necessarily there between the parties are because of what has happened over the past few weeks it's going to take our time\nA Senator Flake is an open about that he wants to do something ...\nTo ... that process or a very ringing I guess you could call it a more film a camaraderie uh within the Senate certainly it's not it's a place where senator has legs who spoke about this on the Senate floor and also during one of the Judiciary Committee hearing White House wanted to be\nA that's something it's going to take\nAs I said you're a quite some time especially when you consider we have some mid term elections upon us for weeks I Believe from today\nAnd so the partisanship it's only going to increase in the weeks to come\nAs it stands right now with no senators change their vote we believe that vote tally is fifty to forty eight fifty yes votes to forty eight no votes that would come from\nOnce this vote is official Brett Kavanaugh is an associate justice on the United States Supreme court senator Danes Republican from Montana not voting is he attends his daughter's wedding Senator Murkowski explaining\nHer reason for voting present because of Danes apps and so they are still working through the vote tallies making everything official um before this vote is called but as we expected\nOr the votes appear to be there for Brett Kavanaugh that upcoming associate justice on the United States Supreme court but John there's a little bit of formality of a little bit of paperwork a few other things that happen to be done before a Brett Kavanaugh will be addressed as a Mr justice right\nWell that's right he of course still needs to take the oath he needs to get sworn in the White House indicating that could happen as early as this Monday but that is a federal holiday so perhaps we're looking at Tuesday when he's sworn in and of course you know this already chaired the Supreme Court\nA session this term the Supreme Court has already begun began the first Monday in October this past Monday so a ... soon to be called justice Kavanaugh will have missed much when he finally takes his place as the ninth justice on the U.S Supreme Court\nProbably will be able to catch up and it's too old so I think that Supreme Court justices have to take not just the one that you are\nCorrect that's correct and so uh we'll see a public oath that the uh\nBrett Kavanaugh will take that will likely be here at the White House if they follow the same form and function that we saw with Neil Gorsuch last year when he took his place and of course there was a big ceremony and the rose garden here at the White House when that took place I Would imagine we'll see the same thing take place for Brett Kavanaugh\nIt looks like or many of the Republican senators have started to walk around shaking\nHands I see Bob Corker the retiring senator from Tennessee shaking hands with majority leader Mitch McConnell who is um had a pretty broad smile for most of the days you can imagine getting this confirmation through it has not been the easiest road we're waiting for that vote total to be announced by the vice president who's presiding over the Senate Mike Pence\n\nLooks like he's got the gamble in hand which usually is indicative of an announcement about to be made by the presiding officer um other senators now now moving about as well as this vote is about to become official\nFifty yes votes forty eight no boats confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court\nAnd we continue to\nThe way to ... sometimes ... there is a little bit of of um formality and procedure that takes place with the Senate votes particularly on these\nAre very important ones you want to make sure every US Senator has just been counted everything's been counted the correct way before you\nYou drop that gamble but this was an outcome that was expected after those procedural votes yesterday in the announcements that came following from a senators are Collins and mansion and flake um the loan or a Republican no vote\nAre coming from Lisa Murkowski who is changing her vote to president Mr Carr indifference to Senator DeMint [noise]\nStrip Carper\nNo [noise]\n\nSounds like they are working their way through it was a senators are beginning to leave the floor so that would be an indication John that\nUh they believe their their work here is finished um regardless of of the outcome that they favored are opposed\nUm it has been interesting to watch Lisa Murkowski the Alaska Senator or the one Republican opposed the Kavanaugh a sitting at her desk watching all of this continuing to speak with colleagues are shaking hands with it looks like a West Virginia a Republican Shelley Moore capital or\nA Supreme Court justice who she felt would be hostile\nTo Robie waiting she announced her support for Brett Kavanaugh yesterday or that vote was considered key to his ultimate confirmation here's a little bit\nOf how Susan Collins explained how she got to her position of yes uh yesterday on the Senate floor\nDebate it's complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process it's not a try\nBut they're fun nano legal principle that you press\nThe presumption of innocence and they are you there on my thinking and I can not a band and that\n\nThat was Maine Republican Susan Collins talking about the sexual misconduct allegations that have\nBeen leveled against Brett Kavanaugh he has a very defiantly a defended his name and said that those are unequivocal early not true uh brought out a second hearing a in front of the Judiciary Committee with him and uh a woman who made that accusation Christine Blasey Ford\n'em and ultimately you heard that they're having a big impact on on the ultimate decision of of\nOf ah Susan Collins the Republican from Maine now one of the other undecided up until yesterday was another a moderate Republican Alaska's Lisa Murkowski or the one Republican who ended up uh stating a negative position on confirmation and here's her explanation\nI Believe that judge Kavanaugh man [noise]\nGood men [noise]\nClearly and learning channel [noise]\nIn my conscience [noise] while I have kids out the end of the day with my conscience I could not concluded that he is the right person for the court [noise] time\n\nThat was the only nation about Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and again the one Republican who would have voted no she ended up changing that both the president to a pair it with Steve Gaines to Montana Republican who wasn't here but the outcome remains the same Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the United States Supreme court by a bow to fifty\nTo forty eight is one of the narrowest votes ever for a Supreme Court nominee though we expected that to be the case that vote interrupted at times from\nProtests are shouting from the gallery but uh at the end of the day the Brett Kavanaugh will join this United States Supreme Court or you want to talk about close divisions in the United States Senate we have seen in recent opinions John ... a pretty closely divided Supreme Court as well but\nUh that uh soon to be justice Kevin Will will become a member of\nWill that's right over the course of the past few years we've seen quite a few five to four decisions by the U.S Supreme Court a largely breaking down along ideological lines of the swing vote over the course of the past I Would say\nAlmost two decades has been Justice Kennedy who's a place on the court of justice soon to be justice capital of will take the place of and uh it's thought that Kavanaugh will be a more solid conservative vote and so perhaps we will see that swing vote emerge\nA during his tenure on the Supreme Court which could be for the next few decades given how young years\nAnd we've talked about this during the confirmation process uh justices are difficult to predict sometimes you don't always know exactly how they will rule on on issues that we may not even be able to imagine a a pure before them\nWell that's right now justice a soon to be justice a cabin on al judge Kavanaugh he sits on the U.S circuit court of appeals for the DC circuit a he was asked quite a bit during his confirmation\nProcess how he would vote on numerous controversial items that may come up before the Supreme Court he refrain from answering those questions but he'll certainly be tested a and it will be interesting to watch his first year on the Supreme Court he will be confirmed as of course as early as this Monday\nBrett Kavanaugh confirmed that the United States Supreme court by a fifty to forty eight votes in the United States Senate a

special victims unit here at the ... office and a ... which is affected directly by our border so what what's going on trees you and your you know what's a trend you're seeing what kinda programs are are you putting forward\n[noise] you know one of the things he talked about is one of my rules as a prosecutor at the county attorney's office involves handling human trafficking cases and we talked about in our first segment the vulnerable populations that come across and\nIn some of what we see me the women and children that are coming across the border um and people\nTaking advantage of them because they are hoping to come here for something that is a better safer way of life and instead get stuck right back in a situation where they continue to be sold again and again whether it's in the form of labor trafficking or sex trafficking\n... I'm sure a part of what you do in your offices educated law enforcement two and a there'll be folks and groups about what's going on in our counties what's going on in our state and what's going on for a border you have a program that you do that an outreach program to educate our community to come to this\nSo and and I I'm sure it's in effect in and I well I Know Mr mcentire is also part of it there is the southern Arizona anti trafficking unified response network and it's an organization that are off as the Pima County attorney's office as a part of\nAnd it's law enforcement agencies and community groups here in southern Arizona\nAlong with prosecutors offices who do do their best to try to educate the public on what is human trafficking what does it look like um how can we identify it within our own communities what are the kinds of things that we're looking for and more importantly if you see it what can you do to stop it\nSo Saturn the organization that I was just talking about certainly is a collaboration of community members and law enforcement and prosecution organizations to help get that message out there\nI Know we've had that what you've got to be educated groups come down to educate law enforcement oh what what to recognize it and there's there are some clues and he's with recognized for citizens to if you see something say something that's the model here with our moments very\nUh but I'm sure some some of the your office to if you ... what you look for somebody looking for a child that's been exploited ... would you say they should be looking\nFor one of the most vulnerable populations that we see here I think at Pima County involves runaway juveniles and kids who are\nAt risk already kids who may be placed in group homes um kids who may be placed in foster care and what they're looking for is a sense of emotional support maybe even financial support and there are people who prey upon these young kids\nAre runways who are on the street who need to figure out how they're going to get their next meal or approached by um these creditors who are in a position of taking advantage of them\nPerhaps providing them what they need in the immediate sense and form of food or clothing or even shelter and the trade off for that and and the part that the victims end up suffering and having to get for that certainly is not worth it\nIn it and this is just not a Pima County attorney's problem or a law enforcement problem or this is a community problem that\nEvery comedian is country I Know you're three thousand plus sheriffs in the country and law enforcement beyond that are all affected I mean these kids are not just in ... county and the numbers are there going everywhere in the country right\nAbsolutely are yeah and it's something that certainly crosses the states um some of the and I'll say young women at obviously happens to young men children girls and boys alike\nBut this is the kind of thing where once they are part of her under the hands of someone who is controlling them they will not just be here in Arizona but Southern California into Nevada up into Colorado\nThis doesn't stop just within our state it's all over the place and people\nCan look for certain things and try to make sure that they do their part in reporting things that they notice to law enforcement you know one of the things I think here and Pima County and Sherry's been a bit\nThis as well as folks from the Tucson police department as educating parents on things that they can look for with their kids they actually have a program here and it's a class for parents to take on how to keep their kids safe on the Internet\nBecause let's face it in this day and age most of our kids do have\nA way of communicating and it's all on the Internet it's either going to be on Facebook or Instagram Snapchat or Twitter whatever it is that they're using and there are predators out there who are willing to try to take advantage of the kids\nAnd these classes there's not one scheduled currently I'm sure Sherry will advertise that I've heard her do that on the show in the past when the next one will be in one of the things that parents can do is just learned how to get educated on the things they need to look for what their kids social media accounts\nAnd make sure that there isn't a predator out there\nAnd I agree with you know we think of a child exploitation of human sex trafficking we think could email was not just about females as the males are involved just like emails you talk a little bit about that how much do you that\nI Know I don't see as many males as I Do females but we know that it's out there and one of the things with especially sex trafficking as\nWhether it's young adults or teens it's not the kind of thing that they want to talk about if you take a run away who has been on the street who is looking for a way to support themselves they come across someone who doesn't announced himself as a pimple or a predator but someone who's just going to give them a place to stay perhaps for a night or two\nAnd then in order to help make a little extra money whether it's a young man young woman boy or girl they then are\nTaking advantage of by this person they are either\nTwo different forms that we talk about um we have people who install force they actually employ force beatings things like that to get these kids to do whatever it is that they want them to do\nAnd you also have others who romance their way into the hearts of young women or young men by buying them things making sure that they have\nMoney um to go do things with and to buy a items they would never even been able to dream of before and once they have them in that environment where they feel as if they're going to be able to trust this person and the victims are then asked to do some pretty terrible things with other people", "show_name": "Worry-Free Financial Solutions", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day":

for a far less a lower price than the out of state of people are paying so I don't want to announce it on the air in case anybody streams my broadcasts and here's an so um if you would just um if you're interested in finding out about note investing\nAnd yeah and you're a loyal listener of this show just call me at three one for sold\nA three one for a so wealthy and uh my name's Bob ... and I wouldn't be glad to give you a code to type in and by the way a hundred percent of the proceeds from this conference go to the make a wish foundation as they have for the past and years mhm I tend to you're doing this so I'm One of the things I'm\nA I Walter Wolford is one of the smartest guys I Know with them investing and Ross IRAs and very small balance accounts that you're only allowed to put five thousand or six thousand five hundred dollars into a year\nIt's actually fifty five hundred if you're under the age of fifty and then over the age of fifty isn't there was a thousand dollar makeup that you can put in six thousand five hundred well how many home loans can you buy six thousand five hundred dollars or you know not a lot what do you do with six thousand five hundred dollars to earn on this is your retirement money I mean what what can you invest in\nAnd Walter has a a a presentation put together we're actually going to do a live auction\nOr option on you know an option in an option is like a real estate contract but you have the right but not the obligation to purchase something so it gives you the ability to tie up a property worth hundreds of thousands of dollars\nFor a few thousand dollars a and then find a buyer that would pay a higher price and and make the profit without ever owning the property\nAnd then in the event that you can find a buyer\nUm you know the worst case scenario is is you ought not to to buy the proper diet and exercise right so an option is like a coupon for tide laundry detergent right you have on the coupon is how much you're going to save and what they had expires right so that's what you're doing is the right you're buying the right\nBut not the obligation to purchase a property\nAnd and therefore you can kind of tied up and then if the deal goes through fine if not they keep your option money so I mean this is a a really good way to just explode the value of a small IRA and an especially for those that are just starting they're very young they've got a lot of time to work\nI mean just think about it if if you could quadruple your money in the first year\nEvery time that doubles that's four times as much for the rest of your life new quadruple the endgame right right if you can just do it at the very first out of the chute so this is just one thing that we're gonna talk about that well they will will also be coming into the studio\nWalter actually doesn't get in until um uh it's three o'clock in the afternoon so um he\nAnd and he's going to leave before the the show a vote this time we're going to miss him he's been in here several times and he's always fun to have him but he actually has a a very short window he's only going to be here on Thursday October eleventh\nHe has a college class reunion that is on Saturday and he's waking up early Saturday morning a flying all the way back to Mississippi to go to class reunion buddies coming out here on his own dime to come help me raise money for make a wish and share his knowledge with with all of the people that that's great so and then\nI'm Quincy long is the owner of quest Iran trust company\nAnd this is the smartest man in America on self directed IRAs and just what you can and can't do in creative investing he is the only person I Know who's the license attorney as owned an H R Block a tax franchise for over Twenty years\nOpen up an IRA company he knows these laws inside and out actually seen him quote\nIRS tax code and then from memory [laughter] and and then it's like that's scary [laughter] but that's the guy I mean if you want to know what you can do a better yet what you know where you can't do yeah um yeah and and then put that with creative investing techniques I mean Quincy has um two\nPresentations one on each day on on October eleventh and twelfth\nAnd then the one of the highlights for me as as I said we we do this event every year for the make a wish foundation\nThis year our guest speaker from a make a wish is a little girl named ... told me\nAnd we actually got to send ... on a trip to watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade last year and and this will be the first time in ten years that we've actually had a child that we sent on a trip with the money from last year's conference\nTo come back and tell us about it this year so it's really really gonna be cool that is cool yeah\n[noise] and actually with the with the funds raised last year we were we were able to grant eleven which is this is just one and and you know it's just very very rewarding we've been very fortunate\nWe've sold over four thousand homes in Tucson this is just a way that we get back you know in the community and when we when we started our or when three team\nUm you know when when when is is went when three stands for and and the clients when both the buyers and sellers the company wins the buyers are the owners the agents and the and the staff\nBut also the community wins and that's that's the third piece of the puzzle that a lot of people tend to forget so this is just our way to get back in the community that has helped us to prosper so a lot of good stuff or my friend Kevin drop is coming in from Indianapolis\nUm he is buying homes between eight and twelve thousand dollars a two bedroom one bath home about eight to twelve thousand believe it or not you're either rent for seven hundred a month so just doing some quick math let's see twelve months seven hundred a month that's eight thousand four hundred you could buy a house in a year with the rent\nAnd and why aren't people doing this why you know and the answers they don't have eight thousand dollars they have seven hundred on their pay day and and that's what they have an and it's just amazing to me how many people in this country you know could one home and in less than a couple of years and and don't find a way to make it happen\nWow so Kevin is going to talk about wholesaling\nI'm flipping houses I'm turning them into rental houses or into real estate notes and just carrying the paper where you get paid every month without any of the maintenance for the phone calls or the taxes are insurance are liabilities that come with rental property\nSo Kevin is going to talk about that so there's my three out of state speakers and then Kelly importer um has been a friend of mine she this'll be the ninth year she only missed the very first year that would be the ninth year she's made the trek to Tucson from my annual events he's the longest ... attending member of a conference and a Kelly is going to do a\nA fun to or a host a panel and the title is ... and new ways you know the mistakes I made and then the and the things that I'm On a whole bunch of things I don't ever want to do it again so I'm going to be a really fun time\nAnd again anybody that comes it's going to be able to acquire a new copy of my book who needs to the bank\nAnd and it's not a a you know I don't go to the bank is just if the bank turns you don't don't stop there that's\nAnd and what this book is is is a very fast rebound every question anyone has ever asked me about private financing like what if they don't pay me like what if what if you know why can't these people get alone aren't they did beats and you know any question like that I've just a a twenty five chapters in the book everyone ends and a question mark\nAnd it's just answering those questions and I love it it's a really really fast read um each chapter three to four pages long\nMy mother was able and she's eighty four years old she proof the book from cover to cover and two and a half hours I'm not just reading a book looking for mistakes in it and two and a half hours so that's pretty good\nUm and then one more story real quick before we end a Denver um has a homeless problem and and so they built the storage containers little modular things that\nWould allow um homeless people to lock up their stuff during the day and and you know when they're out looking for food or or you know where's their stuff I mean and and you know here you are homeless and\nThen how do you protect all your things so they actually made these outdoor storage containers that were meant to give homeless people are safe place to store their clothing and possessions when they found out that the people were actually using them as homes there four feet by six foot cabinets and people were sleeping in them\nAnd and lots of other illicit activity there's there's cases at a prostitution rings we're in a poor by six container out so the city had paid thirty thousand dollars to install ten of these storage containers and\nNow they've just said you know what that was a complete failure we're going to pull them all back and we're not going to do that so that is not the answer just in case a [laughter]\nOther cities are listening exactly exactly\nSo uh that Jerry a son if you want to meet if you listen to us religiously Jerry son is going to pop his head and at the conference also and you know Jerry ... like when you're coming in oh I'll be there on on friday for sure okay and Garrett Lewis typically comes in and if you would like to see the presentation to the child\nOr over the west child even told me that is going to be at four o'clock on Thursday Afternoon at the University of Mary out so look forward to seeing you know there thanks

the individuals was about to retire after a pretty extensive career at a large corporation here in Tucson\nThis couple had saved and save had very little to no debt and had a pretty decent size four O. one K. one that if they handled it correctly and properly planned it and protected it could keep their income in retirement at levels where they would feel completely comfortable for the rest of their lives\nThey also had an opportunity to receive a partial lump sum payout from their pension\nWhich is I Will admit getting a little bit more rare these days\nBut it was another sizable amount of money to add to their retirement accounts\nTheir current advisor who operated on a the only basis wanted them to move the entire four one K. and the lump sum pension payout into their risk based portfolio allocation strategy which was all based on Wall street funds\nNow why wouldn't this advisor offer any alternatives or look at some safe money strategies now some advisors do some advisors do a very good job at looking at the portfolio on a whole\nSome advisors only focus on the fees they only want to generate as much fees as they can and I'm not saying that that's a bad thing but I'm saying that that doesn't work in all situations\nAs you get closer to retirement it's important to kind of shift you're thinking a little bit you shift from your wealth accumulation phase to your wealth spending phase now this recommendation by their current advisor was it the best thing for them in their situation\nMost likely not so what do the client end up doing well here at Mayfield financial we were able to put together a plan that use part of this couple's retirement funds we took part of their four O. one K. and part of this lump sum payment from their pension\nAnd created in income plan that will guarantee and income stream not only to the husband but also to the wife in case something does happen to the husband one of the great things about being a retirement income specialist\nOne that doesn't use Wall Street risk was that no matter what happened on Wall street there was still a guaranteed amount that this couple would get each month and best of all this couple's income would grow each month to accommodate for inflation\nSo you decide what kind of retirement do you want one that is based on risk based on fees and uncertainty or do you want to have a

Federico a safe money retirement specialist [noise]\nYou considered why we have money in the first place and what's the purpose of money [noise] why do we go to work why do some of us try to save or maybe put money in a four O. one K. if we have one or an IRA or other savings accounts\nSome of us clip coupons we buy used and so forth what's the purpose of all this\nIs it just to buy a fancy car or a bigger house\nFor some people maybe but that's not the true purpose of money when you really think about it the reason we save and have money is all about security security in the ability to live the lifestyle that you want the freedom that comes from knowing your needs are met\nSecurity is the foundation to a happy and worry free life\nYou've probably heard the phrase money doesn't buy happiness well that's absolutely true however money does buy security and that can provide comfort and piece of\nMind so for retirement planning your financial security should become a primary issue and this is what Mayfield financial here in Tucson is all about our retirement planning methods are designed with meeting your security needs first and foremost\nAnd we accomplish this goal through careful planning tailored to you which is founded in what we call our safe money strategies for that portion of your portfolio and your money that you need to protect and keep secure\nSafe money provides you with a peace of mind and knowing that you were a central needs are covered\nAnd when combined with Social Security will provide you with lasting income you can't outlive and can keep you ahead of inflation\nYou know a lot of people ask me why is safe money the key to establishing this foundation of security well for one a safe money portfolio cannot lose money to any stock market

your phone number sure and I may I dial\n[laughter] I have two or three seven zero nine five seven six\nAll right and I'm Talking about appraisers you know a lot of times people especially in a rising market there's appraisers are the top of the conversation because there's challenges sometimes in banks skim the appraiser rules of\nOf uh you know what they can or can't do and they give them a rearview mirror saying show me other homes and it was sold for this much money and that means they gotta look backward in time not forward in time\nSo we had talked right before the break about\nAbout a range pricing what what is range pricing and and you know how does that fall into play well when when someone posts arrange the ... the most common question I'm asking is yeah I saw your home listed for five eighty five to six Fifteen so if I Know they'll take five eighty five why would I write an offer for six Fifteen\nWell the range pricing they will take five eighty five it's not a bait and switch right they'll take five eighty five if that's all they have to pay but if you want to come in and and ask for closing cost and you want to ask for a bunch of repairs and you want to ask for you know just a whole bunch of concessions\nUm there's a difference between an offer and five eighty five that closes with cash in two weeks\nAnd an offer for five eighty five that once three percent and closing costs and doesn't want to close for six or eight weeks and and then asked for another five thousand dollars in repairs so the idea is is yes I Would take five eighty five it that's all I had to pay\nNo closing cause no repairs or if you want to finance the closing costs in this is quite common where people asked for closing costs the sellers counter offer back to a higher price that way the price still falls within the appraisal\nOf are within the asking price and and the president saying why are you paying more for this home than the list price [laughter] so that's the reason if you ever see range pricing\nAnd our MLS requires that if you are going to arrange price or property it has to be the first word of the lifting says range price you know some people know right away um but I I actually think it's it's it's a really\nGood way to market at home because it isn't a bait and switch putting some low ball price that you'll never accepted it's a it's laying your cards on the table saying this is will take\n... and and um you know and why why play this game of let's ask way more money than we expect to get and hope somebody comes in and offer ... everybody knows they're not going to\nThis way it's like this is what they'll take bottom line and anything less than that don't waste your time that's transparency about what it boils down to ... so I'm you know and that said we had a a a property that is listed in right now\nIf you look at this deal fell out the ah the buyer just kind of got a case of buyer's remorse and and then write two days before closing backed out and and now there are just when he's now in jeopardy\nAnd and um you know basically they're going to probably lose it because they didn't back off because of financing they just change their mind\nSo the cellar and taking his house off the market for six weeks\nDo you think there's any fewer buyers right now than there were six weeks ago yes tremendously so the sellers been harm they should get that earn this money so um but anyway this I had a ... an offer come in and this properties list and it's the cheapest lowest priced home I'm\nA three bedroom home with two bathrooms if you do a search from ever valley over to Mount Lemmon all the way down has green valley it's over five hundred square miles this is the lowest price livable not boarded up three bedroom two bath home available in the entire MLS\nAnd its price at a hundred and thirty thousand dollars and I got an offer this week for Seventy thousand I'll give you a Seventy it's fully renovated it's it's a it's a fix and flip home but there's some you know like what a waste of effort to just go you know ... view offers to the wind is ridiculously\nAnd of course as a real estate broker I have a job to present to every offer to the seller and you know I just you know please respond back and we'll get back to this purchase you know this person and tell them no thank you and we'll move on with their lives but um\nI think you know it's another story I Want to share with you or something else up in this ah this past because it was an exciting week um you know but we were talking about appraisers and you and I are both huge fans of appraisers 'cause they have a very difficult to correct and it is a um\nA you know that's why appraisal management companies were set up is so that lenders are won't turn around and trying to persuade a an appraiser to come at a certain value but appraisers or have a difficult you know task is that they're paid less from from what they're paid now from what they were paid years ago\nSimply because in cities are making them saying hey if you want to be on our panel will only pay X. amount of the themes he can make more money but so it's a it's a difficult so than it is an appraiser really doing an objective\nYou know a decision because they're forced to doing well I've got to get ten more appraisals done\nIn a week than I used to have to do so what are they doing they're rushing and so\nWhen when when any of us rush the mistakes we make mistakes and well we're not looking at things from all sides to to give a value and I I share this because I got a I've got a a a a situation that happened I'm doing alone for a gentleman in Idaho you buy a house on the border of Washington state in in Idaho in this in a town\nIn the city there that I'm In the AMC ordered an appraisal from yet from someone out of Washington and don't know how it happened 'cause we're not ...\nWe'd also the appraisers license in Washington or their properties in Oregon or in a Idaho\nIn Idaho yes and so and we're not party did is we don't know this and the\nUh the listening agent didn't catch it as a person one on the lock Boston and signed and he got the appraisal done the next morning after they were visiting the house and it came in sixty thousand dollars low on a four hundred thousand dollars wow Fifteen Percent low Fifteen Percent\nSo I talk to both the agents and then I talked to the AMC saying is this a lot of praise and they wrote these long\nOut as as to why it was a lot and and where the appraisers theory was not\nYou know ... is a where they were they felt that that the appraisers logic was was not right\nFor um analyzing the value of the film and so we ordered another appraisal through a nationally and see and they happen to choose someone from Idaho and it came in my ... like two thousand dollars below ask well I mean that was ... the Alvin dollars wing between two appraised\nOn a four hundred thousand dollar home that's a huge swing\nIt is and and I would if the situation like that would have happened in Tucson or Phoenix I can analyze it 'cause I Know those markets so well right\nBut there I'm doing alone for an old friend of mine that I don't know that the city and the the adjustments I can gauge that so I'm going off of a a ... to the games he found that the the first one was a lot and the the deal went through but I mean if the eight dollars in dollar swing well\nBetween two appraisals for four hundred thousand dollar house\nAnd now the buyer and have to pay for a second appraisal\nNope I'm all parties um uh the two agents and myself decided we would chip in for we split at three ways five hundred dollars for a new appraisal um\nMan but I suspect and I've seen it happen many many times this is why you want your son on your side and by the way he is license not just in Arizona and in Washington and in Illinois and in Texas I'm In\nA Colorado and you know he's given all of my sister and her children loans um but if you know the thing I like about Jerry as he does so much volume you spread those costs over\nOver hundreds of loans instead of somebody that only does one or two a month and and they have to put all their overhead on one loan\nSo more than likely soldier during let me just ask you the difference in price\nIf someone was going to buy a two hundred thousand dollar home from him get a loan from you or a million dollar home and get a loan from you what would your feeling be different note would be to say exactly the same ... that's ... ... you're so if if you know people are you have another home in other states and you're thinking of doing or ... or purchase\nJerry's your guy for loans now me I'm only licensed in the state of Arizona for homes but I have friends all over the country that have been a master minds with that I can refer you to make sure you're getting into you know somebody that does a lot of business like I Do in that way you'll have ... that kind of experience working behind you\nBut the I'm definitely in the appraisers um have a tough job I mean there's a lot of online\nAn appraisal you know on the deals out there if they have nothing to do with appraisers the ... you know the value of waging doesn't even know what have been in these your home has just look for example if you're looking at a lower truly or anything else but we'll talk more about that next week

specialists\nMany of you might remember Superbowl fifty one\nAfter all he just happened in February of two thousand and Seventeen when the Atlanta Falcons took\nOn the New England patriots on the gridiron maybe watch the game maybe you didn't maybe you just watch the commercials either way I wanted to remind you a little bit about what happened during that game the Atlanta Falcons took a commanding twenty eight to three lead halfway through the third quarter which meant about thirty five percent of the game was still left to play\nYou could see the excitement from the falcons fans as it was looking like they finally we're going to win the Superbowl for the first time in their franchise history however on one particular office of dry that the falcons had now mind you they had a twenty eight three lead\nAnd at the time they were instilled goal range so they could have had a pretty easy three point field goal\nThey decided on third down to drop back for a deep pass on this play it was the turning point in the game as Matt Ryan the quarterback for the falcons was tackled for a significant loss this loss was so bad it took the falcons write out a field goal range and they were forced upon and turn the ball over to the patriots\nWith the ball back in the hands of Tom Brady and the patriots a miracle happened if you were a patriots fan but an absolute disaster happened if you were a falcon span the patriots came back and scored and an answer twenty five points to tied the game\nAnd then in overtime won the falcons lost the game many pundits fans and casual observers were shocked with what they had just seen why didn't the falcons just run the ball and go for a field goal when they had the chance why take the risk on a deep pass\nNow Monday morning quarterbacking is easy to do and yes I realized that in that moment decisions like this are difficult to make\nSo how does this apply to retirement planning if you are in a quarter of your life and you have the lead

fingers at each other the tower in two thousand nine cost approximately three hundred and fifty million dollars to build and fix for the foundation problems\nThe estimates are coming in between a hundred and fifty and five hundred million dollars to fix the problem\nThis is why having that solid foundation is\nSo important because if you don't have it and you start building without that secure

cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double a ... different\nTime periods so they take these treasuries and they strip out the interest giving them to one investor and another investor against the principal back at maturity and him recalled strips in Wall Street invents lots of products like this they invented lions liquid yield option notes\nUh they've got tigers treasury interest grain tore receipts there are page passive income generators but no nobody on Wall street has ever created a bear because you know that's Wall Street doesn't like bears um we like balls but I don't think anybody ever invented a security caught a ball\nUm but anyway I digress so\nLet me ask you the question before I described for you whether you should be investing in a strip or investing in a chip a treasury inflation protected security uh tell me what it is you're trying to accomplish\nA I guess what I'm trying to accomplish is that I have quite a few CD right now which are destroying regular interest and what I wanted to do is take out enough money where I don't go over the limit that up my Medicare\nPayments every year mhm with increases\nAnd I know I could go to somewhere around a hundred and eighty thousand dollars in income and I like to do that only by drawing down on my Ira between me and the wife and I don't want to have any additional ... All right that I had that you know be\nPaying to stay in other words what I read there is that they do it if they don't have to report that to the state\nOr hang on hang on hang on I think you might be focusing on the wrong thing here it sounds like you're focusing on trying to avoid additional taxes additional Medicare expenses\nWhat I'm more concerned about is do you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle and will you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle over the rest of your combined lifetimes of you and your wife that's much more important issue isn't it\nYeah so have you done that analysis to determine that\nI haven't really done it out but I think I I'd probably have enough money stashed away that it probably going to be an off whether or not you know depending on how long that naturally and how long to wipe it\nSo I think it would make sense to do that calculation uh let me just do real quick back of a knack for what's the total amount of money that you and your wife have between savings accounts investment accounts for retirement accounts IRAs et cetera add it all up what's it worth\nA probably a couple of metal I get\nAnd how much money do you and your wife spend on a monthly basis\nUh probably three thousand bucks maybe\nTotal all end all expenses\nAre yet probably about three grand aren't\nThen I Would agree with you based on two million dollars in savings and investments and only spending thirty six grand a year and we haven't even talked about Social Security yeah I Would agree with your urine find economic shape\nWhich means you don't need to be taking a lot of investment risk\nAnd therefore I don't think you need to be getting terribly exotic with your investment strategy I mean although it's possible that you might get a higher return from a treasury strip or a a inflation protected bond\nA relative to a bank CD I don't know if the difference is all that worthwhile relative to the complexity these securities\nAnd the lack of certainty you have about them and understanding of how they work compared to ordinary banks CDs the difference in the yields is not going to be all that significant and I don't think material enough for you to bother doing something different\n[noise] All right I was wondering if it would have any effect\nI don't think it's going to be material enough that this is based on a thirty second conversation I'm having with you if we delved deeper\nOr I could certainly argue that all of the choices you've mentioned are paying very low rates of interest in today's economy as you know and there are other strategies that are worth considering that can dramatically improve the potential for higher rates of return\nIs it necessary in your case not really not relative to the amount of money you've got and the amount of income you need not really necessary is it perhaps desirable well maybe that's up to you\nUh so I could argue that you should meet with one of my colleagues we have an office in Cherry Hill not far from you in Mount Laurel where we could go into all of this detail and show you the alternatives that are available to you\nBut that's entirely up to you if you just kept doing what you're doing\nFinancially speaking I think you and your wife would be fine\nOkay okay do you take the oath in Cherry Hill New Jersey right\nYes it is and if you like I'll put you on hold and get your phone number will connect you with our colleagues in a Cherry Hill and ah go from there okay be fine\nAll right Neal I really appreciate your phone call thank you very much you can do it Neal dead and call triple each plant wreck and it's really important that you put your investment strategy and the proper context why bother adding complexity to your life tax complication to your life\nGetting into securities you're not really familiar with are accustomed to when the material differences in results are really not going to be there when\nIn fact you might need to be addressing a totally different question instead which is am I going to be able to sustain my current lifestyle for as long as I in my spouse may live that's the more important fundamental question and you want to make sure you have that answer nailed down first\nThanks so much for your phone call you know I'm really glad to see folks so intently focused on retirement and engaging in planning will you have enough money that's really the key question isn't it I mean if you were Bill Gates I don't think he'd care very much\nWarren Buffett I don't think he really needs his Social Security check right so for them it's not a big deal for you and me so how do you know if you're going to have enough\nI Want you to find out by getting your free retirement review we will

to say you came out one day and you gave training to everybody and they're all on board I didn't hear anybody that didn't understand exactly what you were talking about um there are a few that may disagree with this or that but the truth is nobody understands the narcotics problem in Tucson better than the people who work at the counter and er Cox was\nOh I'm sure as I had somebody asked me this ... can you think some people are feeling oh I can continue to get high and do my thing because our cat will bring me back I'm safe\nSewing and maybe within a British got other experience with this but my experience with that is that was a story people were telling to try to justify why they were not issuing marking him\nTo police officers and I'll go step further and police officers if you're responsible business and you have an ADD in your business for people that have heart issues you ought to have march into if you're if you're a place where people gather today\nThan you should have ... as you don't need a prescription there's a standing prescription issued ... health services you walk into any pharmacy in for forty dollars you can walk out with mark and\nSo it's just like a fire extinguisher anything else you have schools out of all have it um it's it's one of those drugs where uh the downside of using it to zero and the upside is you save lives and so we really believe in it we curate art are cautious period\nPatrol officers all cheery it we have ... and patrol and the patrol officers being in their first were truly the first responder at these things and\nWe beat the paramedics because they don't know what's going on and it's important those seconds to make a huge difference between a Brady what's going on in the field with that now the still suffer are the stories bridging the success they were initially\nYeah I mean I don't have any any hard statistics on the number of of nor can um administrations we've done in the field that I Know that it has been used to have seen the uh the emails come through about it\nUm and yeah the officers are are grateful to have it because when they when they do encounter someone you know if this is a new a new thing that we're dealing with and we have to adapt to deal with it um it used to be when you encountered someone who was unconscious and possibly under the influence of something\nThe assumption was that they were passed out that right we're intoxicated uh we can't make that assumption anymore I'm and probably more likely than not it when you come when you encounter someone who's unconscious and passed out there and they're not breathing it's going to be as a result of an overdose\nSo um yeah we're we're very grateful to have it on as a matter of fact I just got a noted notice it was um we actually haven't had it for for a while it was back ordered from the state but we just got another shipment in and so will be\nA we had another round of officers go through a with our partnership with the center for 'em using the center for\nA urban health um they provide a more training for the officers are so we even have more people that are trained on it now and they're going to\nBe getting their their doses of a no oxygen here pretty soon\nYou know and I have to say a A R experience has been very positive I Do know very specific cases where we've made saves [noise]\nAnd and um this idea though that someone somewhere isn't abusing it in order to get high twice or whatever I'm sure someone is but we just don't run into that that's something we encounter and it's I think it's an excuse to do to to to avoid doing what's appropriate thing is there anything that\nEven so if that is occurring you know in in my opinion it's it's well worth still having it out there to save the people that we do um because it it is I mean you can go on the uh the website for as easy da chest dot Gov which has an opioid section which shows\nReal time real live data of how many doses of nor can had been administered throughout the state and how many had been dispensed and it is saving lives every single day\nOr their classes available for the general public to go and learn what to do and not to do when it comes to this yes and as I said the center for the center for urban house I'm so they have claws yes senora convention works also has availability interest is I think\nYou this is Stephanie ... she is the vice president of nursing services that Kodak and she and I partnered together to to um developed and present the training to all of the officers that that we did a few months back then Kodak has been a great partner with us in this\nWell thank you for joining us thank you nice to meet you too okay the other question I I was thrown at me [laughter] the ... the TV show the ... and we only have like forty five seconds left they killed off Rosie odonnell with another day of opioid\nHow do you feel so I watched it and I am and I think it's a great platform to talk about the problem but I was personally really really offended by the laugh track they had when Rosie o'donald so I was on screen daughter\nA show that she'd stolen a bottle locks and everyone laughed about it because that's exactly what the problem is and maybe we can talk about other than the other side of the break but\nJust a flippant way they treated that showed a real lack of sensitivity to the issues\nAnd uh I appreciate the fact that they want to address the issue I just think they probably needed people a little more experience than rapidly\nRight okay well when we come back I Want to I Want to talk with you about everything that's going on in the presentations that you do\nThere are grants there are there's access there is more than enough resources to cover the cost of your treatment so that should never be a reason that you don't seek services we've just been ... um afforded\nMore opportunity to focus on young pregnant women who are coming in showing themselves onto admitting that they're having a substance use disorder during pregnancy so we have more resources available to them we have a partnership with Tucson medical center that will enter them into their treatment for

insured we will bill your private insurance if you're publicly ensured a little like a public insurance if you don't have any insurance we will help you obtain insurance and if you don't qualify for any of that we have grants available to subsidize the cost of treatment\nSo there's actually no reason people should be supporting the cartel in buying drugs on the street because we can make you

because we have a whole clinic full of people who are going through what you're going through some of our employees or even in recovery and have worked the program and um gotten silver\nVery cool tell me more I talk about your program because I think it's important\nYeah so um as I said we started July first I'm In partnership with Kodak and uh so October first Martha three months that we've been ah we've been doing the deflection\nUm we've had ride around Ninety deflection which means I'm there have been Ninety individuals that officers have brought to the ... clinic for um for treatment for substance use disorder of awesome of of really any kind um it's not just limited to opioids\nUm so that's cool to the Kodak is is helping us with people that are addicted to meth and and other drugs as well um of those Ninety people about approximately sixty percent of them are still engaged in some form of treatment there\nUm which I think it's a really positive awesome number um we are still doing things like getting our our officers trained in motivational interviewing 'em to try and I get more people I'm engaged in services\nUm but I I I think that sixty percent is a really awesome number at this point um in terms of how many lives when you look at how many lives are saved\nAnd Stephanie correct me if I'm wrong but that's in line with the success rate for treatment it is general right it is can you tell them a little bit about the difference between not treatment versus just you know success rates versus regular treatment\nSure for persons who tried to go cold turkey just tried to quit using opioids success rate is somewhere between five and ten percent will actually be successful that success rate of persons who hair their treatment um with medication assisted treatment such as Suboxone or methadone\nWith a hero modification through group therapy individual therapy psychiatry\nA success rates are closer to sixty to Seventy percent on average I think it's around sixty three percent was the last study that was done so the chances of gaining sobriety and entering into recovering ... every go up on you mentally when you pair medication assisted treatment\nWhere on the different psychosocial interventions\nLot of people have some misconceptions about what medication assisted treatment as they think oh you're just trading one opioid for another you're just giving them crotch that's not single so all stand alone is not a goal of treatment just giving someone methadone and sending them on their merry way is not what we do\nAdditionally it's not a life long medication it is not a cure it is not a curative process it as a corrective process that allows you to let the psychosocial interventions take old allows your brain to heal from
