schools at churches in this particular case this is the largest anti Semitic shooting in history of the United states\nAnd you know when the president says that you know having armed guards at school or I've been advocating for a long time now retired police retired military\nOn the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school\nAnd that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question and it's not to me about the gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter\nWould you prefer that there are that you know that there are trained professionals in that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments it's usually by the time they get there it's ... it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect and in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um it's been used before but that's not a big story of the day the saddest thing I watched\nAll we got to watch very closely and even hearing my name brought up a number of times and you know just shaking my head because people obviously know nothing about me they do nothing about\nYou know they don't take the time to either bother to watch or listen to this program if you've been listening to this program\nYou know we have been decrying going back to Kavanaugh the angry mobs\nIn Washington confronting bidding at senators not letting them closed doors there\nWe've been talking about how dangerous the left wing mob mentality is ... and we've talked about the incidences of Sarah Sanders and her family or kids trying to get something to eat secretary Nielsen trying to get something to eat\nYou know we've talked about Pam Bondi trying to go see a movie Mitch McConnell walk into an airplane numerous times and Mitch McConnell haven't as his table slammed on food ripped off his table just last weekend Kevin McCarthy's office having a Boulder sent through it\nYou know and I've been saying it it's we've got these everybody's gotta stop\nNow we've been talking about the rhetoric we heard Hillary you can't be civil kick them Eric Holder and talking about Maxine Waters a lot you know if\nYou see these cabinet members you get a crowd or does she thinks is going to happen when the crowd is formed and you follow them into restaurants and department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted any anywhere anymore\n... how is that going to end well hold the story when I met senator what's that guy's name from Connecticut again Blumenthal when I was coming out\nThere who was in the middle of the capital hearings you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation\nI invited him on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know where he's thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people or getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says why is there this anger out there\nThat we have you know all these bombs that are sent out\nThe first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nAnd George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that want me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life\nAnd even if it's being spent is islands made you know what I still believe in free to\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt and I have consistent consistently over the years said that when President Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House says that happened\nWe've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at a time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box but you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch the Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time you know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre on President Trump\nLook if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country you can chronicle it you can watch it they don't see it which is sad their views and their bias and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they lie and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter guy Rodney Bowers by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated\nThe fact that President Trump and I think he could make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people and then he the this killer lamenting there's there's no maggot as long as there's a you know\nBad word of a quote infants ... infestation\nBut despite those facts you have people\nYou know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted to the president's words matter silences complicity what does he talking about Paul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part\nSpeaking sarcastically Krugman pleading a link to the story with the caption but no but none of the white supremacist terrorism as anything to do\nA Trump oh no it's unbelievable how they now have you know believe their own lives Alan Dershowitz had a powerful column in\nThe Daily Caller today and he's been a a passionate defender over the years a staunch defender and rightly so of Israel\nAnd Jewish civil rights anyway drew linked this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said a day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison this is Alan Dershowitz\nAnd he went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance\nKen salads at home is the key here I'm dealing with them but I'm a combat him down and do something\nNo what I

peace as we all stay a main and these rush [noise]\nRefined Myers is no\nSpeaking after the synagogue massacre amen to old was he just said there\nYou know we've had a lot leading up to all of this and go back to the Kavanaugh hearings I didn't hear many people on the left to cry the angry mobs that were going on in the halls of Congress I I got to the point where I said probably it's better if we cleared the halls of the public\nOr you would think in the people's house that the people will be allowed to go where they are elected officials are but it was obviously becoming\nUnsafe for people senators being spit at you saw the treatment of you know we've had in recent weeks what do we have rice and sent or what was supposed to be rice and send to Susan Collins home during the Kavanaugh hearings slope coat hanger sent to her office et cetera\nWe've watched than in recent weeks racing or what they've said wars rice and being sent to the president and General Mattis and our FBI Director right and our CIA director Gina Haspel\nWe watched the last few weeks what we watch these mobs and people being run out of restaurants\nYou know Sarah Sanders in her kids and family secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi Ted Cruz Mitch McConnell airports and having his table slammed in his food thrown out the restaurant door\nI've been telling everybody that the rhetoric is too hot and too heated and people need to come down but nobody on the Democratic side ever decided to stand up and say this this has got to stop\n\nOn this program I set it when Obama was president it's got to stop we got to protect our elected officials\nThe day that they mailed this the first device was sent the George Soros his house first thing I said on the radio I said we've got ... this can happen in this country\nI Know he's not a fan of mine in any of the people that were threatened by these bombs but the rush to politicize this and turn this into well this is who conservatives are is just one big lie\nWhat you're watching unfold before you're very eyes is you know the race to politicize tragedies\nThank God those twelve or Thirteen PVC bombs didn't go off and nobody lost their life thank God\nThat was in Donald Trump's fault\nAnd then you can you know look at this terrible tragedy and they're shooting in the synagogue or this rabbit anti Semite racist and also a Trump paid or not that it should even be relevant\nIt's getting scary we had real bullets used over the weekend also to shoot up a Republican Party headquarters in Florida\nYou know and that could have killed people\nSouth Daytona police investigating after they said that someone shot out the window of the local county Republican headquarters belief set of worker arrived Monday morning saw the damage called authorities\nWe have another threat of a man has accused the guy who's been arrested but threatening to kill Florida congressman Carlos\nCurbelo that story came out this week yet he's been threatened\nThere was a campaign rally would Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn and you had an angry leftist mob disrupt disrupting that and a half a dozen angry liberal protestors\nDefine or tipped the balance of power John James by the way is now only within six against Avon out he was one soundbite twenty you'd\nBe he's a totally great rising star in the Republican Party and I think it'd be great we'll see what happens but you know I think the house can slip so there are three possible scenarios\nA week from this Wednesday the day after one is Republicans rock the world and shocked the world again and they\nHelp hold on to the house pick up Senate seats that's the ideal\nFor eight days and there's a split decision they hold on to the Senate pick up seats but it's speaker elect below

showing toll free telephone number eight days till election day one week from a tomorrow that was the president talking about the Pittsburgh should have gone synagogue shooter\nUm we're letting getting to know a lot more about Robert Bowers and who he is he was a very ill an anti Semite he was a huge critic of Donald Trump or in a lot of ways\nUm and the president you know she'll keep for saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings\nWhere the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed and appreciated\nOn every front hum will get into all those says we continue rose cannon I'm the host of winter rolls on Rosen plugged in Pittsburgh, PA\nI'd long run to the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rows are very very sorry or thoughts and prayers go to everybody or the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes beat my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood\nI go there to shop and to dying and and in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the neighborhood is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding community\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who is cutting with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community in the Pittsburgh area and it just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sticks thinking that this is starting to become political\nAnd it's in ...\n... there's an interesting side no to this little throw this to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turned against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know at a pretty powerful\nColumn that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan I'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged with Farrakhan and\nObama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we have had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nAny person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as anti Semitic bone in his body that have their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Sarah ... members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nI get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate\nAbomination what climate is he a way it's been a press release about some of these kinds of things and listen this is Linda ... praises\nResume oh day ah terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she's been praised by Christ in dealing with a kilogram she's it praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now\nUm if words matter those things matter a great deal as it should be expected when you're normalized Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews it should be expecting\nAll the way that our hair she would put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree\nWe we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with Farrakhan shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic ... he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism in any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as as part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week for outcome was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson of Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a wreath of Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral that he was ... I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find may here too and there's something I like your listeners to know because\nI I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published and written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate right here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hand they said that you yourself called the\nMurder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination if he were influence\nAnd they said you're in the past three years you're working your policies have\nInviting that's involved in this\nAnd the you know what was interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls from listeners today they they pretty much agree first of all of that than they are just that your listeners now\nNot representative of the Pittsburgh Jewish community they did not speak for them but many of my listeners said these people are are there and obscure left wing group I'm a very progressive chase and and they don't speak to the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh I've been told by many this morning\nYou don't have everything with David go Harry important\nVery important point by the way I Wish they were obscure Peter Beinart as a matter of that group that is real ... and hater from start to finish\nRecorded that George Soros his grandson is a member of the group that purport to speak to this ... for this wonderful Pittsburgh community I've been to the tree of life shall I was a guest of the rabbi there for about ... it's a wonderful place\nThey're not haters they're not people who want to politicize anything and the president by the way can't win for losing the guy who sent those pipe bombs around\nA claim he was a follower of President Trump this guy the shooter the killer in Pittsburgh it's President Trump is talking about global is there is no longer insult in that war world\nConservatives by in large mainstream conservatives David are the biggest supporters of Israel in this country I've been friends with prime minister Netanyahu for twenty five years friends with a ... and and Shimon Peres a in others you've\n... you've broadcast from Israel you have been a great friend of Israel patrol under set right and on foot look good articles lately and an entire stream of the Democratic party now\nThat is frankly Israel haters and not give a past this Alexandria Ocasio Cortez these new people on the scene Palestinians and the ... it's just not true they're peddling wise about Israel and that's very very dangerous if you believe words matter\nWhat words matter this was the deadliest anti Semitic attacking us history the president also saying we will seek their destruction which I agree with\nI got to take a break but we'll come back more with rose tenant and David shown on the other side I saw friends that show many have done it again right if you look in the mirror what do you see maybe a little bit of sag along your jaw line\nUm remember ... when he gets rid of bags and pumping this Sunday your eyes it's their number one best selling products you can't get it in any store and don't forget there's sunspot correctly you had a little too much sun in the summertime\nAll ... now done it again they're introducing their brand new Gen you sell jaw line treatment with dual peptide and empty old technology which is their most advanced technology ever so in other words it\nRight as we continue rose tenant and David shown you look at article after article in the Washington Post\nRose tenant you know saying that the timing the president to the Senate gone synagogue mass murder\nAnd and that's insane ...\nI'm Sorry to interrupt you shine oh it isn't saying it it is it ... it it is them desperate trying to help the Democratic allies win elections\nI Love the rabbi said rabbi Myers said that you know he's a citizen of this country and if the president wants to come here please con he would not objecting at all the president's it which I appreciate and when we start focusing on the blame game which is what we do especially the the ... media\nThat then we lose sight of what really happened to you know what really happened is as we just got an anti Semite killed ... that was his goal those were the words that were true and spoken for him and he wanted to kill Jews but we also had\nPittsburgh Police who are amazing I Love these guys I noticed them any and then they went rushing towards the gunfire while everyone else it of course is rushing away we had a document ...\nWho went to care for gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives that they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth these were not acts of the nation divided that's what the last month that the way the media wants to believe\nThat we're a nation divided but we're not\nWe're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman we roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice\nAnd and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media it just makes me sick because we missed what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said he\nSaid the bullet holes

key races now in the Senate will watch in Florida it's a dead heat and that's both the Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor\nAnd Ron dissent this was a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle of people showing up in the panhandle you had a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett us and we have British students team on tapes\nAnd that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really has taken people back also on tape staffers progressing calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall holds but people have got to get out to vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against that pony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically it's just like Obama but she too like bread as soon as hiding who she really is Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota is down by double digits she also was exposed by project Vera ... uh we now have\nIn a Braun in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe Donnelly a Democrat and only the only\nFactor there that I really see is there's a libertarian that's drawing vote so away from the Republican so if you're in Indiana don't vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly\nWe've got a hold the seat Heller seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada and then Arizona I have no idea why poll came out this weekend

Sean we're uh we're currently are contacting twenty six million evangelical and pro life and pro family Catholic voters and Nineteen states we knocked on a million nine hundred and seven thousand two hundred twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and\nAs of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had in a midterm election\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think we'll definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats and two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are it by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature for our organization is ignored the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the litter\nOr everybody me you know I make a living for people not ignoring mining law\nYou're except it okay but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman and

people right except for one of them I\nBreathe founder chairman of the faith\nAnd Freedom Coalition um and I think that the ... look there are many factors I think Kavanaugh is\nPlaying a part in this I think the Democrats none of them have spoken at all about the caravan their silence has been deafening and they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and seen a photo but you know it just means we believe in the rule of law and we're not going to wait the four weeks till\nKnow seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic\nParty side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up a Republican headquarters in Florida we saw the terrible shooting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican congressmen\nHave an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans\nPunched in Minnesota uh there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nAre Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nThey're Americans in every way but on pay for those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them just respect the rule of law and they are

hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there for what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should we saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around that to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to\nWork in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nIn a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them and who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column midnight I haven't read the whole column ... my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the Mark I'm in the la actually that's a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this sort of folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president's Elaine who basically tried to overthrow the constitution to make himself all presidents for life there and done with the Venezuelan\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the\nWork of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American government look bad in our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and I'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of\nAssociating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a with a necessity for me to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also a nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to get him just added stuff if that's the principal well when I'm not\nI don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he says\nPeople rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\n... ugly began at the sun shine we don't want to be heard and also it it was undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S up\nOn the look probably been lied to you know\nI'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross on so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply used as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of\n... that is a horrible raunchy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nLook I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country and\nI've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or ... million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd apartment on that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is being looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nWithout question of what you just describe age most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who will control the border that we are supposed to allow three to four million people move here\nBecause that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion and we obviously cannot we have to maintain control of horrible\nYeah All right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred nine for one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program and we got to take a break up right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections would turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings your tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages for one case that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future politicians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November\nAnd go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com\nThey're going to make it simple for you to do your part now you can mail make calls and emails tax\nKnock on doors help neighbors get to the polls go to big choice election dot com because the only way we lose this year is if you don't show up if you don't turn out go to big choice election dot com do your part and let's not get out worked\nIn November big choice election dot com will come back for your phone call straight ahead eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number\nOh yeah right here and get out of a media man room\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats ... if the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada\nI think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana and we'll win North Dakota\nFlorida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to and the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this is real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results\nOn the morning after the night before and it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely so\nYou know I'd rather go full for the gusto and win at all what are the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirement\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses because Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a\nCommittee chairwoman and Adam shift as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman\nIt just it's a disaster for us eight hundred dying for one Sean or toll free telephone number [noise]\n\nWarning twenty four hours may contain diverge inconvenienced\nBy a hundred percent for what you say I'm Sorry I have to argue with the listener dissent in ...

with us twenty five now till the top of the hour a there are about thirty races now we have identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they have narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point is actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats and the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we\nIn the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when that you want to go for him in the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians cinema can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest poll is beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exactly even five forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida round the sentence was coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his\nThe leaders stabbing now in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was one twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll in West Virginia where mentioned is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seen is very weak and could be the big surprise of the night\nBoth West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise is not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of commissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district to fill Charlie dense empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say that Sean first off thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say we're for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got Brett ascent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we've got Heidi Heitkamp will unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they planned to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing and the case of Tennessee got reticence that calling the people in Tennessee ignorant\nSo is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day that\nDemocrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can see pass or angry is Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixteen when the media had two scenarios out there one of the best the best case of Hitler and wanting the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president we have the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast that the two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten to mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nGive the crumbs back increase to regulate its watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Tucson", "day":

...\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of meat to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to prediction it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida and through a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or schmooze or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media's fall in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know Ron dissent this about are the great debate last night and he is now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nGillum his use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views is trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBy being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett is it and the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe've got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason bred as it is out there trying to convince the people to Tennessee that he is something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh\nIs just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets Phillips is an RV tour\nWith with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the health care costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texans alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nI mean it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing him a throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and the healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visits a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's gonna happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha mix Sally is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean it's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving\nCore values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd Americans instinctively don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country we don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nNow the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid or Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blame the Democrats for not giving us the boats to change our pathetic laws and that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done or the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back we have a lot to get to more than ... much more straight ahead\n[noise]\nHearing comfort and film and he smiled any greatest catch for kids brings all three families with children with special medical mean hospital treatments can be scary\nEspecially French Army and he created for kids from the front room is hearing therapies and community programs reach over thirty five hundred people providing relief minimizing offering free of charge\nMore about how you can have\nAny way to do our genes confide to own three the early ... sixty five\n\nWhen you were tired of the paycheck from your job will stop but you know what most on utility bills medical bills in taxes just to name a few [noise] so what can you do you can call martini and more financial strategy Marco show you how to develop another stream of income that can last just as long as you do kind of like creating your own personal tension\nCall market two nine six four four six four or on mine more at bat dot com by contacting as you may be provided with information regarding the purchase of insurance products including annuity license in Arizona won three one six one one zero so much\nUse on Houston hours looking through the windows in your home but have you ever really looked at them like how effective are they do they offer safety and security and here's what\nAre they energy efficient well Tucson window and door looks very closely window and they've got windows that can cut your energy bills in half decorator windows for every look and windows it offers the ... the insecurities in Tucson window and door his two sons from your window at least the company and say no windows\nLip Tucson window enjoy give you a free no obligation I\nJust called to nine eight or nine eight or call now and see how beautiful secure and energy efficient windows can be live more comfortably in your own home call tonight eight V.

that the majority of people in the care of on not ... that are headed to the borders are not as is being reported families including women and children\nAbout instead they're quoting multiple reports that this new way above a caravan hers is comprised quote a mostly young men who appear able bodied and could easily fend for themselves back in their home countries video footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants you\nKnow by a chain link fence said the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling offends others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap in the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross into Mexico\nAnd this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I'd been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why wherever many times I have seen it it's wide open\nWhat are we gonna what's gonna happen if we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping the caravan ... make their way to our southern border\nResident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally it is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty they're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies\nThat allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out

Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders in Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nOr said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly\nUm so you've got the care of and continuing their march now a couple of other things that you've got to understand here is a

I think we're going to be fine ah but yeah we're here to keep it here in South Carolina last friday so we're all over the place\nYou don't always get interesting to watch the states like California Southern California it's six important house seats that could be the the ... the balance of power in the house Minnesota has important races Ohio does Michigan does Pennsylvania and New York and New Jersey do\nYeah no I think in the end of Sean\nWhen you look at the radical positions the leftist fake I Would argue the most extreme positions in American history where they you know they applied ... when he this respect the flag they Iran don't recall when he said America was never that great and they they embrace Maxine Waters when she got harassed anybody support our president\nContracts that isn't for where they want to take the country as we've talked about before with what the president has accomplished at Twenty one month with his leadership in this country taxes regulations down economy growing it for ... percent lowest unemployment forty years course each and cabin on the court\nOut of the Iran deal embassy in Jerusalem it on and on we could go so those are the competing visions those are the ... that's the contrast I think when American step back and look they're going to pick Republicans or we're going to keep the majority in the house\nBetween no due process for Kavanaugh no presumption of innocence for Kavanaugh these are core values that have served as well as a country and then you've got this lawless caravan and I I don't hear a single Democrat saying we've got to stop\nWhat is it looks like an invasion fourteen thousand people just want to run across the border maybe more\nAnd if that happens what's gonna happen after that\nIt's like a party that is basically given up on the rule of law unconstitutional and the values that have served do so well over these many years\nExactly right or the most extreme positions\n... got closer with this comment you got\nFormer Secretary Clinton said oh yeah we'll get civil again once we have power that's not really supposed to be this great nation and like you said before it's sort of tough to avoid the immigration issue when you've got this caravan merging with thousands and thousands of people\nUm I think the president's right when he's talking about you're not going to get your foreign aid if this if this is going to continue and talking about putting hooks on the border putting troops on the board reporting National Guard in order to make sure\nThat we saw what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now a ... it's almost like we're headed towards a major human confrontation here people that don't affect our laws in sovereignty and the president saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty\nUm no I I think Democrats go in the back of their heads hoping this happens southern all maybe something bad will happen and Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you'd you'd never know I Hope I Hope not I prayed not yeah same here\nBut I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady couldn't is that the Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said I'm In I'm sick of this kind of stopped she could get the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted to start her goals and dreams in this great nation\nThat's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happen and the and the possible politically application\nAnd and motivations behind these things that's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming assign um aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem that we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to confront on either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watched it happened a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nOr we saw Mitch McConnell go through this at the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now Henry Kissinger was shouted down listen to some of this [laughter]\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nKnow I got a Ninety two year old man who served his country it's a\nYou know it's unbelievable you know what the ... you know ... uh what's her name Maxine Waters you you create a crowd you confront them you'd do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell leave the country you know then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil with somebody you disagree with\nNo this is this is as wrong as a gift is is not how not on a decent people are supposed to behave in and it is you know where the part that bothers me the most Sean is Dennis Kucinich is a good friend of mine and he is as far left as I Am now is actually a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the idea that he will show up and have a robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he ...\nNever left this isn't new to this is the way it looks and and and people who believe in addition to their ideas and their their policy that's supposed to be but what is happening now is don't games or or this country and so so wrong and just\nWaiting for this great nation off or how\nDoes the president and this would be my goal the president obviously is is going to pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing it has this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to I didn't want to get hurt at the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know getting where we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that nickname with the crowd that want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life ...\nIf they're hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safest for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't want to see people the president does want to see that\nBut they can't you can't allow them to come in either\nNo I write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced the Democrats won support it because I think it down they want the politics of this issue they don't want to solve the problem we need more judges on the border we need more ability to when people get there to hold them not this action release all the whole damn\nThat the Republicans hold the house I have a lot more confidence in the Senate I just can't get a a post on motivated people are and the districts the Seventy districts that matter that\nWe either by the balance of power Pennsylvania New York New Jersey Minnesota Michigan Ohio where you are California of all places Minnesota of all places those congressional races seemed to be with a power imbalance will be accept\nYeah I mean I mean I only have one I think Americans have common if they don't want to go with the the radical vision that left is offering I think a second we have good candidates\nTake Chicago a Peter Roskam district for Apple Sean here's got Iraq there was one in two thousand and six year we actually lost a house he beat Tammy Duckworth and now us a senator from the state of Illinois he beat her in that election Peter Roskam knows how to win so we have good candidates across the country who I think know how to win in these top top climate\nBut again I think when you look at where the left wants to take this country I think most people with comet that's got to say I didn't sign up for that I'm going to keep Republican control and the great economic gains that we've seen under the leadership or the ...\nDo you think the cabin on hearings the caravan the mobs um coupled with the president's success ... is is there a base out there that we're not hearing from the polls are picking up yet\n[noise] I think that's very likely I mean we haven't necessarily seen it we haven't really polled but when you anecdotally around talking with folks you sense that you feel that that people are in fact moving a in that direction and and were outraged by what they saw what happened to a judge capital\nAnd what are the your house members it Freedom Caucus guys how's Dave Brat and doing it now we're going to actually talk to Scott Perry at the last half hour how are those guys doing it because they're in their new operations are\nThey are they're doing great but I'll I'll give you the best examples rod blow up he was down like ten twelve point three weeks ago he's now that it within one point that's what happening because\nOur guys are working hard good\nCandidates working hard on the American people are waking up to the ridiculous positions at the last what this country to\nRide Jim Jordan

can in the state of Pennsylvania and on November the sixty three term incumbent isn't a fight to keep that dream alive is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge Scott for this newly drawn district and\nPerry won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of uh Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision\nThey decided read do draw that state's congressional map as a district that has a chance of flipping and\nAs Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking that's a hand you're dealt and ah anyway a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting then they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this week that they wanted to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlighted some of the things er during the course the big thing they're doing which are not just doing it to me you know in talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nAh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it and that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our healthcare system and and passed Obamacare and ah you know you know a\nTwenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan to keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us for medicine it up um we try to repeal it of course you know what happened with John ... put what thumbs down but you know Sean when we fought the original Freedom Caucus in particular for that original a bill\nOut of a you know the ... the replacement for Obamacare because if you remember we're going to vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it\nThe original bill that deal with preexisting conditions among other things the Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew\nYou know went and talked to the president talked or leadership it said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right\nIn the bill that we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we broke healthcare\nWell it's all part of the big ... tried to fix it\nMillions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is will Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual

tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats were not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be a sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary Milton Friedman one set about\nAny country if you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border to participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get a you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days model a lotta left leaning shows ... they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's\n... response all you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents in democratic elected officials that have voted off the wall was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nI've everybody saw ... ... ... well could there anthropology\nSo why don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ten percent of the society shut the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving the lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get hit and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he's at the end of the day he resonates with these people for\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspirations\nAnd America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white\nFree market based motivating market incentive policies on because what we both know is that you cannot system the ties\nOr through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up\nAnd then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but\nThere's no moderation left either mulch and the Democratic party it used to be I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about\nThe American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper\nAll of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the Malone\nYeah All right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is with us Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs\nAre and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back and listen we're all big supporters here on the Sean Hannity showed the second amendment also responsible gun owners that's why we're friends with\nThe USCC a they're giving away free gun every day twenty four days now you'll

Hannity show chooses groups would accuse us border patrol works with American troops\nIn when justice was was liberal friends she refused to\nArizona and they\nRan for the state house in the Senate in Arizona [noise]\nI looked and your son was in the spring and fall on\nMy mind to make Sally and I approve this message\nAre we have a big race going on in the great state of Arizona Fifteen days from now glad you're with us twenty five to the top of the hour that was and they put out by Martha mix Sally a war hero and her background or experience was pretty unbelievable here also watching and Arizona this caravan\nAre headed right towards our southern border has become well a big big issue\nWe have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back come\nFirst instead of a once calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake you know that blind shake involved in the what the bombings in America\nUm she had no problem with Americans joining the Palo bond\nMartha McSally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked BS stay at home moms for reaching off their husbands\nThese women who lack like staying at home ... their husbands or boyfriends and just catching the checks to some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think Martha ... with us ah Martha how are you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls one had you up by seven want to do it by two ah but ah I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about ... I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nShon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed in her mocking Arizona and your extremism on so many issues as being an earth\nBut the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous\nSo out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nUh the here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past this\nQualifying statement you know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly fighter jet in combat\nUh and then the first to command a fighter squadron and combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was an absolute honor of my life to be able to serve\nKnow when you hear ... cinemas say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Taliban and nearly died\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include you know truth well I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on the taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there is no this is silence there and everyone is leading giving our final salute to these American heroes",

James O'Keefe\nKnow you are hated by people because of what you're doing it there I'm ... I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just auditor discussed and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most\nHating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them as the United States Senate or had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage you mean it's it's\nIt's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri their their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journals do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about her some of these position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed is something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about that ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now uh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees that McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding and masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us to take the money ... indirect means\nIn order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life than pro gun Democrats are shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in the state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we ... the American people had it when\nThe Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute cabin all was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then went all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you've got these anarchist middle class of benders attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punch by an anarchist trying to stop him\nFrom taking her campaign side\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but\nI think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was the stuff that sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable and they play loaded on your show last night and she said the number that quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley that's her opponent would be part of fraudulently abetting someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay\nAway from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud will will walk by what recording the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own were there and there are some\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers next to roast about how she's going to impeach trumpet you can tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and innuendo an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out and before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates well I have known you know what for a decade or more\nThat's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next\nTo release the candidate a bit of the time we have to the United states senators and their candidates opposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of you to send me Lenski tactics against the ... the Lenski was to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the reaction\nWe have two reactions now and we're going to the next state will be releasing another video early next week in a very very a battleground state same theme Sean ... they have to lie and then once they get elected will do deal bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do and it's it's just on videotape stopped my words not my", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "17",

anywhere on I ...\n... am seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk\nOf course Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife are now we have mob violence in Portland in New York and we've got two Republicans punched in Minnesota\nWelcome to uh I guess the world the Maxine Waters\nGet a crowd and tell them and follow them into gas stations department stores and and and restaurants and you tell them we don't want to\nKnow where the un now where any point any time I mean is that the New America because I didn't I don't remember that um [noise]\nWell that's certainly the America will desperate left because they're losing a the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I ain't gonna keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new elucidate violence a which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because this is Steve ... proved when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taking over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I ... everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as a pension his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is worth a\nCycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity\nAnd there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to the Goldwater of fifty four year movement\nUm but I think it's also coming to a crisis because Trump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with them and in the end I think that just further isolate some\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration they want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just\nThat and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right in this part of me because I tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be treated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be\nA magic moment in American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind our cabin all\nAnd caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination childish behavior by US Senators in Senate meetings I think all that came together to really re galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan\nComing up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks because it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the\nFeinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance\nAnd remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala highly four thousand people is now grown too amid a spike among a U.S border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall and that just as it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump's manhood I mean\nYou know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams a who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says the show's on Romney distinction between a\nWell who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor in California who openly says he wants to government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean\nThe Democratic party is becoming the party they'll the galaxy the party of breaking the wall the point you made earlier and a party which we can't win with legal American votes and so it's got to try to find some way to turn around the system and it's an amazing thing to watch though\nAre we going to get Newt Gingrich's prediction Nineteen days till election day I'll also his take on the show gave it looks like murder and who's responsible and how the president should handle this ah as it involves the Saudi and the Saudi Government and the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nEight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program many things we're down in Palm Beach Florida\nNews radio twelve Ninety W J uh no uh I Want to remind you look you know an off year elections it's about one thing and that's showing up\nAnd this election is the most important literally in our lifetime here's what's on the ballot your tax savings the American economy\nJobs are on the ballot your kid's futures are on the ballot for one k.'s or on the ballot small business owners guess what your tax cuts and burdensome regulation that's on the ballot and the biggest issue on the ballot who's in charge of the future\nPoliticians bureaucrats are we the people\nYou want to preserve the victories of the last two years and if you're not sick of winning you might want to go to tax cuts work dot com tax cuts work dot com are they going to make it easy for you to participate do your part make calls and emails tax knock on doors bring neighbors to the polls whatever you want to do\nThe only way we lose you don't show up tax cuts work dot com so we hope you'll do your part in a lot not let them overwork us or out work us right tax cuts work dot com as we continue Rush Limbaugh the full hour tonight Hannity on Fox News will continue [noise]\nPhones in a policy parties chaos and corruption all day [laughter] this is Sean Hannity show\nGiving you clarity Sean Hannity's on pay and as the [noise]\nFor us to a break a relationship with Saudi Arabia which is the key\nTo containing Iran or what but I think we have to get to the bottom of it let me also point out to folks I'm just now working on a novel for next year called collusion in which the Russians are decide they want to push in the U.S Senate or\nIf I were writing a novel about a Saudi journalist being killed and the circumstances are just strange they're gonna they're gonna kill him in the Saudi consulate\nIn Istanbul knowing that the Turkish intelligence services monitor them all the time they're going to do it with a team of Fifteen people um it's almost like if they did do it and I'm not saying they didn't I mean clearly something terrible happened and and clearly\nInvade them on their sloppy and stupid and you know a ... it's unbelievable the position they put any of their allies\nAnd you're right we have this unprecedented an alliance against the Iranian had Gemini with the Saudis Israelis Emirates Jordanians and Egyptians and it you know now that creates massive complications\nWell on but if you look at it you know we've said pretty clearly we're not going to tolerate the Russians poisoning people in Great Britain and to lead to very specific sanctions\nOr I couldn't imagine a circumstance where if we do in fact decide that the evidence is overwhelming under the Saudis have the least promised secretary of state Pompeo that they're going to give him the full report you know again or they may well be lying but\nIf in the end we discovered that there are key people in Saudi Arabia and all I suspect it will be sanctions but that's different is one thing they have sanctions it's another thing you know to go wild and break up the the alliance and the relationship and the Israelis have been very clear\nThat they regard Saudi Arabia as such an important a defense against Iran or do they have urged us to be very careful in this process\nWe've got to go but um this is speaker uh it does complicate things but people do remember that our arch enemy are aligned with U.S Russia the former Soviet Union to beat Nazi has a\nContract and I think sometimes you just said you know we have taken steps against Russia in concert with the British\nOver killing ... trying to poison several people but we didn't we didn't go ... I think we may have to take significant steps ear and sanctioned some people and blocks and people from coming to the U.S and I think frankly a crown prince had better clean this up or he will not be allowed back in the U.S for a long time\nI miss the bigger thank you for being with us we got to take a break by David shown and Carter Page will join us as the deep state gate gets a little deeper eh my buddies de do see we're going to get a lot of your calls and we have the other news of the day and what do we do about the caravan Nineteen days out of election day\nWe're in Palm Beach Florida Rush Limbaugh tonight for the whole hour on Hannity as we continue\n\nCome on the movie talking ten minutes okay we\n... we never followed up and getting your eyes ...

know a lot of people will begin to rush come out what are you doing telling me about it I Can't you go out and get a real this is\nThat's the point\nThe reason you can do this yourself from the reason you can't do the others just wires stop and think about it you have a house like let's say you're going to have thirty different sensors throughout that I'm just picking a number of every one of those things about that but why are run to what you want to do that you're not going to do\nThat you're going to hire some team to come out and run a site survey and then they're going to run the wires and you're not going to want the wire steam so they're going to have to be behind the wall or taped up the base boards or whatever that means miniature construction you're not going to do any of that\n[noise] and then when something goes wrong with wind up those wires that might trip the whole system or at least provide a fall somewhere you've got attracted to [noise]\nYou don't need any this

that are limited time when he be meant to be found because they all work\nOut [noise] they they all have the characteristics that we're trying to look for in a rush out there they were not in the correct shaken packages okay excessive or not enough postage stamps they were taken to a post office they were dropped off probably idle processing facility okay\nIsn't the point of a mail bomb you

in Indiana a will be watching and waiting the whole time they don't look to let me tell you what the worst news is in the you know we've been watching all of this happened\nYou know all of this incivility that we've been monitoring and the silences been deafening it's just been especially deafening from Democrats and the news media\nThey've been unwilling to criticize things they obviously should criticize and it's been going on two years this this is not a new phenomenon it takes on different forums it all started with Donna I Wanna I Dream an awful lot about blowing up the White House\nAnd deteriorated from there and deniro wanting a punch the president in the face and Joe Biden wanting to punch the president taking mind yard and then fight it out and Duke it out\nYou know this is the Democratic party Hillary can't be civil Eric Holder kick them\nWe watch what's happened to Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders entered kids Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell and his wife multiple times boulders now being thrown through the office window of Kevin McCarthy the house majority leader\nI mean and there's been virtual silence\nAnd we have this terrible incident that we have been watching where you know these suspected mail bombs you know thank God of the ten that have been sent a they haven't even confirmed bullies that they're real bombs I assume that they are thank God none of them went off\nBeing sent to several prominent Democrats around the country we do have one instance where Republican is being threatened we didn't have the the two instances of Minnesota with two Republican candidates were punched one\nGuy got whole ... from the ... behind that a concussion that's going to keep him out of commission for six weeks you know we're living in times where the hypocrisy reeks the media Democrats they only care about Russia collusion if Russia collusion involves Donald Trump which it does not\nBut then when they see all the evidence emerging that Hillary bought and paid for\nRussian lives by funneling money too from a law firm to weigh up research group that then hires a foreign national that makes that won't even stand by you know his ridiculous stories of hookers\nUrine ... beds in Moscow and Donald Trump years ago in under oath the says I Can't confirm any of this it's just you know well it's fifty fifty um it's raw intelligence what do I know\nAnd then that still becomes the basis to commit fraud on Pfizer court and then it still becomes the basis of you know these role upper echelon not\nRank and file big difference you know the structure the pages the ... the ... of the world et cetera you know all writing Hillary's exoneration she should have been put in jail or tried but then she gets to continue than she spends the money on the Russian dust ca\nAnd then when they can't be Trump even by disseminating those lies to you we the people well then they go the next step their insurance policy which is even though Lisa Page said there was no evidence of Trump Russia collusion and struck said that\nThere is no there there well then they start immediately strategy leaking again the same Clinton Russian dot CA and that becomes the basis of the appointment of Robert Mueller\nAnd then we go off investigating people's loans happily applications good grief it just as pathetic but they only cared about Trump Russia collusion media ignored that\nThen the media when it comes to judge Kavanaugh and the new Kavanaugh standard which is guilt by accusation all that to only is applied towards Republicans\nBecause I haven't heard Camilla Harris Spartacus or Dick Durbin or you know a Senator Feinstein or any of them ever demand an investigation and FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nThat's fairly recent and we're real evidence real text messages a real tape real doctors' reports none of them have said we need an FBI investigation into him\nThank goodness the people of Minnesota are paying attention 'cause that matters\nYou know again it's it's it's there's just hypocrites only care about Republican Russia collusion that doesn't exist not Hillary collusion they only care about stopping cabin all but not stopping\nYou know Allison are not stopping the recent allegations based on the cabinet standard we'd be calling for FBI investigations into Corey Spartacus Booker\nOr Bill Clinton himself up we're going to go back forty years\nAnd the rape allegation with Juanita Broderick it others\nAnd then we take it a step further you know they only care they don't care about violence the threatening violence against the president or listen to this montage of everything that you know just a small one I can go on for hours of all the things the media didn't get all worked up about listen\nYou cannot be criminal with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough not being liberal\nWith a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and during that ... he can start again and he had any second an elevator

the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make\nTowards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday\nAs they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind that nothing we do with law enforcement we do alone for a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision\nThat can say with certainty that we will identifying arrest a person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\n[noise] New York city's intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second it on every day the air and not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the French dream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today too out of an abundance of caution will tell you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today\nI have a mensch pride incredible work the men and women are the NYPD do each and every day especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today are concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts\nBut we do care about is keeping

to be said no conservative I Know what ever support this horrible act or this type of violence depravity\nAs a president condemned it yesterday um\nNobody knows who's responsible yet everyone's rushing to judgment like they usually do\nWhen they can politicized something you know is this has now been unfolding you you watch people assigning blame or to all political rivals especially President Trump and they go to Fox News then talk\nRadio and it goes on from there meanwhile we have heard the plate some of it in the last hour play some a bit later in the program today the most

I walked off the CNN uh they stuck\nBranded in the middle of broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought was a good idea\nThe general public some insight as to profiling packaging whatever the case may be a and then he got on for it had been a blast of the president I just think it's bizarre I took his way over the top I think\nThey're going to you know what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining in detail than you left and they send cameras following him for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the SAT we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then then you have to ruptured and said that was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was set to CNN and his name um but then he got on\nAnd he went on this had been a tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for give the general public some real insights\nAs well but Brandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chase me down the block trying to get me to come back they were calling me but you know what an office enough already ... listen\nThis is a time you need to unify the country like Giuliani and I did in the aftermath of September eleventh this is not a time for division\nAnd CNN and granted we're at the max dividing uh the the audience that was watching the show\nThere is no conservative out their Sebastian Gorka ... nobody ever\nIt's not being conservatives that have been you know saying things I Dream an awful lot of blowing up the White House\nUm it's been Hollywood wants to punch the president in the face and showing ... heads of the president and those that talked about a killing the president et cetera um that's been the rhetoric of the left the media's been virtually silent it's ... it's Republicans and conservatives in\nYou know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi and Sarah Sanders now Henry Kissinger Kevin McCarthy's office a Boulder is thrown through it\nUm and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife ... you know we've been saying that we better be really careful here I've been saying for weeks now going back to the Capitol hearing so I was saying we better clear the halls of Congress\nSomebody's going to get hurt somebody's going to get killed and no one will hold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up\nAnd then those people that were silent when it's a Republican\nNow or oh this is outrageous we can't have this kind of rhetoric and this is this is horrible he can't say fake news they are fake news\nThough they are and we need to keep using that phrase and I'd also like to congratulate the commission of just doing what he did yesterday that was a cabin or moment whether you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the list of who it is CNN anybody\nTell me which Republican which member advisory media all the political leadership\nMade political profit\nFrom are you going to solve is willing to shooting Steve Steve ... which Republican member of the\nThe pop the all the media profit to personally profit for his side of the rice and off the white powder was mailed to the Trump family members of the cabinet off the individuals were\nThat happened three weeks ago President Trump FBI Director re a defense secretary Mattis and and the CIA director hat all all had rice and mailed to them\nThe way I've had white powder mailed to have a\n... over the years I mean it's a horrible thing that anybody has to go through we all want to catch his ever responsible here uh but whoever it is is not somebody that would be that we would know as a quote conservative and it's just some nut job or some lunatic on what it doesn't matter what their politics are\nWhy why is it OK why is it okay for CNN to run high runs a day blaming Donald Trump for not taking responsibility for these attempted letter bombs why is that okay when was the Republican profit from congressmen actually getting shot that\nAt a baseball field very close to where I Am spending about\nBy left wing activist\nThis is this is the double standards that the average American see through and this is why we're going to vote down ticket Republican on November to six because they had enough\nOf the lives of the double standards\nYou know it's the same thing burning and I agree with Sebastian that\nYou know it showed a lot of courage what you did yesterday but I've known you so long I Know that's who you are and it comes second nature to you you don't even think about it I got to take a quick break more with NYPD Commissioner Bernie Carrick more with Dr Sebastian Gorka and more of your calls and then later on\nCongresswoman hopefully soon to be senator from Tennessee Marsha Blackburn

thing to do um but with that said um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nA joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and I think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on\nDifferences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal the more and more people\nDrilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out you\nKnow I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business\nAnd it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened to Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America that between two candidates and the more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a rage\nTo President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's why the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today a I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic

Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you\nA good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are\nUm uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead now but we really don't hear a whole bunch about a repeal or replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks we have a ... a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold onto the house you know doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races than the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to happen by the way preexisting conditions a big lie that's being told all over the country\nOr the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh ember atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks a treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack a cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge care you ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor or your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great productions and pharmaceuticals and\nIf something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario and it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... concierge medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been ...\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website ... dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here\nIf you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida we're a little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn is going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on in about\nA we definitely need more than ...

I'm tennis fans want to say fairness and trees and respect for others and respect for differing opinions and ... respect for the rule of law and abiding by the constitution and what we have\nA fish are resistant should face and focus Democrat Party is oh well that ends will justify whatever means sit where we're using and people are appalled at how they are conducting given south\nI saw the British ... first reaction to the tape of a his staff calling people of the people of Tennessee ignorant and by the way Tennessee happens to be one of my favorite states Nashville like right at the top three cities in the country and I\nWell that's because they all they love you in Nashville in Tennessee you\nWell I mean even bigger I live ... miles south of Nashville are just off a sixty drive\nAnd I used to go up to Nashville all the time I ... I Love music city and I love the people of Nashville and I've got to imagine they were pretty insulted a and a little bit shocked that somebody would be that duplicitous behind the scenes and then when he he said well those are just college kids volunteers and we find out no that's his full time staff\nAre I'm sure that uh he was embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether or not but of course he didn't they start saying\nWell if it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not this was a project their toss project but they started saying well all these other excuses but the ... they got caught they got caught saying we made this decision\nBecause we want to go to people about where he is don't worry he got it kept crap when he gets there\nSo you got to say this that and the other in order to get him there and it's\nLike as a parent I mean when your kids do something wrong my kids do something wrong which rarely happens ah kidding but\nYou know what it's not um I'm never as bad as what they did but if they try to lie to me about it then they're in big trouble not a little trouble I don't care what it is I can deal with a mistake I Can't deal with you lying to me in looking in my eyes and just outright lying to me and my lines of my kids is\nYou know I I Am not stupid stop treating me like I Am stupid I'm fries it's fresh is frustrated I Swear to God I Swear and when you know darn well they did it\nThat well that is true and in any of our relationships whether it's family members are now that we work

with the brightest and campaigns\nAs people are saying that if she didn't like it you say and what people know about me is that they may not always agreed with me but they are always going to know where I stand\nAnd that is has been central to me as a part of my public service and people expect that and I\nKnow you a long time a congresswoman and I know you'd make a great senator and I hope the people of Tennessee understand that um what are the issues because the economy's doing very well and Tennessee\nThings are looking up we've had two years of great economic growth since Donald Trump spoke president out of the people of Tennessee feel about the president's policies and and the important vote the boats that you will be casting that if you become the next great senator from Tennessee\nPeople those supported the president Donald Trump and say look to see his policies succeeded they want to get my ... going to be a conservative and it's going to support President Trump and
