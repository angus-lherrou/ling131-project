please\nLet's talk about [noise] gives me\nThe difference of fiscal versus monetary policy\nThe markets this week continue to be resilient it's amazing the beginning of the week how we saw a um huge gains ... the Dow Jones came within points of hitting twenty seven thousand we had a huge surge in the markets beginning of the week\nAt the end though that surge\nWas on trade news when we talked last week that Canada would probably come together here at some point while it did on Sunday night in the last hour final hours\nAnd the markets cheered on that news President Trump was able to get rid of NAFTA and replace that with the United states Mexico Canada agreement the U.S MCA United States Mexico Canada agreement\nHe did exactly what he said he was going to do he was going to renegotiate NAFTA he was going to get rid of NAFTA and have a new agreement with Mexico and Canada Mexico was on board Canada was lingering out there and there were a lot of thoughts even the week a week ago\nThat this may not happen and it did\nWas a lot of optimism there was a lot of excitement enthusiasm over what's next because we now have trade agreements with Mexico Canada South Korea that the president is renegotiating trade agreements for\nUs for America so that we are on a more level field so that we are not being taken advantage of by the rest of the world\nWhen it comes to trade ... uh to China's\nGoing to be next China's out there those discussions are going to be next the European Union Japan there's other countries out there that are in the works of course there's been a lot of nervousness over that but that that is the next in line it's a positive thing for the markets\nAs we got mid week we started seeing interest rates spike and so we saw reversal of the early early week gains tenure treasury yield went to levels that we haven't seen in seven years over three point two percent on the ten year treasury we\nHaven't seen those yields in since two thousand and eleven\nSo we're seeing we're seeing the ten year treasury move higher or seen interest rates hold well above that three percent level that we couldn't get to stay above for a long period of time now they were surging\nReally we had a huge moving interest rates that scared the markets a little bit we saw sell off in the markets towards the end of the um end of the week\nThere are so many things that were happening in between all of that that we're going to talk about on the show\nBut for the week the Dow Jones ended flat literally flat started the week ended the week the same\nYes and the five hundred was down one percent the NASDAQ was down three point too so you did see a little that you we some more of a sell off in the tax theories that have been so strong this year we saw more money coming out of those areas year to date the Dow Jones is up seven percent\n[noise]\n\nThe News I'm John McHugh Democrats still vowing to go after newly minted Supreme Court justice Brett

I don't drive so I don't understand this situation works but I just like when it comes to approaching when we shouldn't be in those purchases over a computer for the fish [laughter]\nWell I'm an Italian Mike I personally\nAgree with you and the concept of buying a phone or a car excuse me over your phone or your computer\nAn e commerce platform to buy a used car does seem a little I'm Crazy now I Will tell you we have someone that that we know that it's actually kind of ours that bought a car to carve on us so they described to me this whole process\nAnd it was pretty interesting how it works have you are you familiar with how it works\nCompletely the question\nBecause you can do can you have the option to strike because yes you have to concern is\nYeah you do so here's my understanding eminent disclose I've not bought a car from their ... actually gone on and tried it but\nUm this is this is how it how it works you go online and you look and they have an inventory of cars you get a three hundred and sixty degree view with some ... was at a type of imaging technology that really I I don't know I guess it helps you see what you're looking at a little bit better like it's like you're looking at it face to face\nBut you can get financing warranty coverage all of those things on line what you do is once you select the car that you'd like to try they come and deliver it to you so they're they carve on at the headquarters is out of Phoenix\nBut they will come this client of ours lives here in Tucson they got the car delivered to their house on a friday they had seven days that they could test drive this car\nI'm sure there's something might that you have to do ahead of time before they just give you a car I'm sure there was some you know ... you know you've qualified for financing so if you take the car and run off or I don't know because they don't stay there with you don't have to drive with a dealer there's not a dealership there's not a sales person will bill like\nQuestion because you would think most people would go with you shut it down\nAnd then when you drive a car there with you they have your license but they are in the car with usually can't drive it off and take it away this is not that way they literally got the car and they were able to drive it for seven days if they decided after seven days they didn't want it then they could have it picked back up\nThen pick a different car to have to try out instead and they're all cars they're used cars I knew a lot of them are um least cars you know so they might just be a couple of years old but I I I have yet to look at all the inventory in what they have on there\nBut that's basically the process and if you decide to keep it if you decide you like it then\nYou know you can do your financing or what not and now you bought your car without the salesperson so it is a different concept but it's picking up and it's it's ... in it for for us that haven't used technology forever it is different\nThat are used to these face to face but I Do think it's a brilliant idea especially if you have more and more people are going up with technology\nSadly they don't do the face to face stuff as much so this is a way or if you don't have the time or you don't want to deal with the hassles other dealership you know that we are talking at the at the break my dad my about just what painted as to go into a dealership sometimes\nBecause it yeah [noise] so dad what'd you say you bought a car from Costco right or had gone through the process on Costco the costs New England\nAnd that was an easy because you get rid of the dealership\nPart not that we're promoting getting rid of dealerships it's just a different um less hassling way of looking and talking to someone that's not trying to sell you anything you're able to browse and look and try things out and do what you want\nTo get one other question was can work this week in Texas would still waiting for is Rick I'm In the winter the experts go into objectively already gone into effect\nYes and if they didn't do as payroll so if he has a certain amount of deductions where you would have seen a difference in your tax or your paycheck at this point and we can ask this question we're hoping we have a gas that should be here in the next an hour that's an accountant so we can ask him the same question as well\nBut what should have happened if ... and it really depends on people's income and how they get paid if you have a set hey that doesn't you know you have a set paycheck or a wage salary\nThan you would see it some people that our our our earlier that work on commission or in seeing seeing it's there but they're not seen at the same but basically the tax brackets have lowered so if you were in the twenty five percent tax bracket that went down to twenty two for example so the withholding or just a little bit different which is what gave the increase in the\nIn the um\nPaychecks to people\nBut not everybody can figure it's not as simple as just looking at a line item that shows your extra money it really depends on how how you get paid or what your paychecks look like\nYour salary\nYeah yes exactly okay so You're welcome mind thank you for calling and thank you for listening All right All right we're going to go to\nBill Hi Bill that you're on the money matters show\nIs I'm Wondering if you were grounded\nWho I Am yeah well let me well you know what I'm going to do 'cause we're about to go to a break bill in thirty seconds but I Will tell\nYou a little bit about myself before that

Fernandez\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nPet tape [laughter] the first hardliner\nSets of\nOn in there you could put a CPA in there yeah and we have a very important yesterday who's going to talk about\nThe new tax law bill and how it's affecting a individuals' I'm so I'm going to even though I have a light the um report on the letter see I'm going to try to cut back a little bit because I think it's more important to have the Mr CPA\nA you know be the headliner today what do you think\nThat this is your time to shine so whatever it is that you'd like to do and you are cooperating very well okay with that with that the gas that's locked in ... when excited to have him here\nFirst of all congratulations to the cats of on that big win last night a little\nBit of a comeback in the defense or played a significant role a also tomorrow is Columbus Day uh we are open a lot of the banks I think are closed but um it'll be a busy um week I think with the earnings season starting to kick off\nTowards the end of the week and then there's some important economic releases throughout the week uh but getting back to fundamental Stanley which uh you got into on the economic side\nUm I thought that might be appropriate to talk about common stocks versus corporate bonds because we that's what we talk about here investors are always told to diversify their portfolios between stocks and bonds here's the difference between the two types of investments and I'm sure there are many people out there that don't know the difference\nBut common stocks or ownership of the company corporate bonds of the dead of the company stocks and bonds represent two different ways foreign entity to raise money to fund or expand their operations\nWhen a company issue stock it is selling a piece of itself in exchange for cash when an end to the issues of bonded is issuing debt\nWith the agreement to pay interest for the use of that money during that period of time they that that that bond is out stocks are represented by shares in individual companies here is basically how it works say a company has made it through it start up face\nAnd become successful the owners wished expand but they are unable to do so slowly through the income they earn through their operations\nAs a result they can turn to the financial markets for additional financing one way to do this to split the company up into shares and then sell a portion of those shares on the open market in a process known as the initial public offering or an ideal if they're going to list on one of the exchanges\nA person who buys a stock is therefore buying an actual share the company which makes him or her a part owner however small that is why stock is also referred to equity\nBonds on the other hand represent that government corporation or other entity such as ... that needs to race cash borrow money in the public market and subsequently paying interest on that loan to investors\nEach bond has a certain ... value say a thousand dollars is typically a\nA par value of a bond and pays a coupon rate to investors so that's part of the contract that they get into when they buy a bond for instance a thousand dollar bond with a four percent coupon would pay twenty dollars to the investor twice a year or forty dollars annually and tell them the Tour de de\nUpon majority to invest in his return the full amount of his or her original principle except for the rare occasion when a bond goes into default and they can't pay a last caller mentioned GM you know mhm GM went into default on a number of their bonds\nThe difference foreign investors sent seat share of stock represents an ownership stake in a company meaning the owners shares in the profits and losses of the company someone who invest in the stock\nCan benefit if the company performs very well and its value increases over time that's why people buy stocks just let their money grow at the same time he or she runs the risk\nThat the company could perform poorly and the stock could go down or in the worst case scenario bankruptcy disappears it disappears altogether\nIndividual stocks in the overall stock market tend to be on the riskier of the investment spectrum in terms of their volatility and the risk that the investor could lose money in the short term however they also tend to provide superior long term returns stocks are therefore favored by those with\nWith the long term investment horizon and no tolerance for short term risk\nBonds lack the powerful long term return potential uh stocks but their preferred by investors for whom income is a priority also bonds are less riskier than socks while their prices fluctuate in the market sometimes quite substantially in the case of higher risk sacrament\nThe vast majority of bonds tend to pay back the full amount of principle laboratory and there's much less risk of loss\nFor those than there is with stocks which one is the right one for you we think a combination is the best way to diversify having both stocks and bonds and your portfolio if you can afford you know that\nThat risk\nCommon stocks are just quickly are are near all term highs a button investor Ron Baron who I quote on here about every six months or so thinks that there's plenty of room to run he runs a company called Baron capital\nA and he's consistently on CNBC a as one of their people that talks about ah you know the markets he says growth is accelerating um and he says that he says if the stock market is tied very closely to the economy\nThe economy doubles roughly every ten to twelve years and sell the stock market should double every ten to twelve years over the long term he says I Can't see any reason why that is going to change I remember he said at one point\nThat ah the Dow was eight hundred Nineteen eighty guess where it is today are close to twenty six thousand that was six hundred Nineteen sixty\nOr the GDP of the country was five hundred and twenty billion dollars back in Nineteen sixty today it's Twenty one trillion dollars uh he thinks that stocks are going to continue to rise even after climbing ten years some last financial crisis\nSo he says stocks are the best play as they return eight percent a year compounded\nNuts we know we talk about those numbers over long periods of time the markets through the ups and downs will average somewhere between\nThat eight ten percent or a return\nSo for the weekend you gave the numbers the Dow Jones was flat yes and the down a one percent the NASDAQ down three percent\nA it was a pretty volatile week there's a doubt started up a Monday when Tuesday and Wednesday and then on third you know it had five straight up days and then on friday Thursday and friday it was down\nClose to four hundred and eighty points which brought it back down to level\nUm as far as uh let me talk real quick\nUm we talked about interest rates are ready companies with a letter she would just mentioned

seven Ninety Kane is the\nMy I Am Natalie Fernandez filling in for dean we've got Ruben here we've got Harvey Jansen CPA at talking about the tax cuts in\nOther areas surrounding taxes that affect\nIndividuals and businesses et cetera so we appreciate you being here with some updates our phone lines are open aided zero five six seven eight that's eight eight zero KNX T give us a call with any questions or send us a question to Facebook Live on the Greenberg financial group age we can answer you there\nAs well are we before we picked back up there is a a question that\nEncompasses I think something about about taxes so let's go to the phone lines to Eric Hi Eric\nThe wording good morning you are live on the money matters show\nThat you're listening I'm this question is a little more ... economy related which individual if if we cut taxes\nSo that the loss of revenue for the government either how did they make up for that do they cut services or do they borrow money\nWell\nThere's a combination of things that the government does the idea with the tax cuts\nAnd ribbon Harvey felon or jump in at any time but the idea Eric with the tax cut\nIs to put more money into your hands and my hands and ribbons and Harvey is in every other American so that we can choose how to spend our money what you are seeing this year is we're seeing our gross domestic product or GDP the growth of our country consumer spending\nAt a very extraordinary level that is the the gross it's stimulating growth in to the economy so the idea of cutting taxes\nIs to put more money into our hands to continue to stimulate stimulate for people that um hire more so for example and Harvey you can probably touch on this a little bit you deal with small businesses if you and and companies\nIf you have company hiring more people now you have more people that are paying taxes so you've just increased revenue to the government but you've increased it I have a more tax payers\nThat are thriving that have wages going up that are paying tax at and we and that's we talked earlier in the show about unemployment being at a forty nine year low it's at three point seven percent that means Eric that a lot more people are working today\nThan we're working a year ago two years ago three years ago et cetera and their wages are going up to what we've done is instead of having\nMore people out of work which requires unemployment benefits food stamp\nI'm a ... federal assistance so there's an outflow of money\nAnd then you have let you know people paying taxes what what they've done the goal of this has to get more money into the hands of people Americans and businesses to stimulate the economy and get people working and it just expand your tax base\nSo I don't know that the revenue yes there is a cost to lowering taxes absolutely because you lose\nThat revenue but the goal of doing it is that you pick that up\nAnd then some by strengthening the economy overall if that makes that\nThat makes a lot of sense of so that so that would mean then that the deficit is holding steady are shrinking but I'm hearing that the deficit is growing\nWell we'll go into that in a second because you also have spending that's not stopped yet so there is a process to that to happen but Harvey I Know you want to do their part\nHow to tax law was the part where they're they gave a break for companies to finally bring money back into the country\nThe corporations if they are in profits overseas the taxes were so high to bring them back here that they weren't doing that so they lowered that raid\nAnd some of the larger companies have been bringing that money back you know and paying a lower tax and what it used to be but at least they're bringing it in and paying taxes and the other thing is that they hope this means that companies won't leave which what was happening\nCompanies were becoming they were moving out of the U.S through a become a I forgot to\n... a company and Europe someplace or whatever but ultimately would take revenue away from here to and another item which we had seen more lately is even individuals becoming ex patriots who would move\nAfter they retire move to Costa Rica or someplace and uh you know because they pay virtually no taxes down there and all they weren't paying any us taxes either so I think they were hoping to stop that a little bit now whether this all balances out none of us well known\nFor a while for exactly right and I really like what has happened\nIs we've got to cut spending bill that bending\nAnd Eric I guess you could think of it in your own household with your own income if you have more income\nThan in your household let's say you have a certain amount of income coming in and then you spend a certain amount of income if you are spending let's say you have you are you know for every dollar that lean in and income you're spending a dollar twenty\nThan you are net you're you\nHave a deficit you you are out of balance there spend more and more than ... should exactly [laughter]\nSo let's say now you go get a job in this case you have a tax cut but anyway now you're bringing in a dollar can you have more money if you're still spending a dollar twenty\nFor every dollar tenure bringing in you still have a problem so there needs to be a mix on both sides if you can get ... up to a dollar ten and reduce your spending down to a dollar ten\nNow you're you're getting closer but if then you can from their start balancing that out\nAnd then now you start spending a dollar five ... upbringing in your dollar ten it doesn't happen overnight it but the first step was to get this tax reform bill through\nAnd Harvey touched on some of the ... that you know from the corporate insight repatriation of money keeping businesses here but then you get into the hiring you've got more people working if not more people paying into\nThe system it's just and that's why they say we're just starting to see the effects of this bill isn't just starting to to get going to go through\nThe ports yesterday\nOn the local level I can say to that we are seeing more people coming to us from who are thinking about starting a business that had really dry up\nA substantially uh people were wanting to just get a paycheck", "show_name": "Money Matters with Dean Greenberg", "year": "2018", "city":

also we all have our own ideas whether it's our our our our ... our ideas\nAre strategies products everything has some type of risks we highly suggest you understand the risks prior to investing it's important\nIt's important because when the markets go up in September in a month that's not supposed to really go up and you're feeling\nGood understand the risks that can happen after that\nIf you do not take some money off the table if you do not weigh some cash if you do not protect yourself and the markets fall have the worst October since two thousand seven\n\nYou will pay at least mentally you should have been prepared because you chose not to do anything before and that is why we tell you to take the risk allies test to make sure that your portfolio and your risk tolerance match up\nYes we have cash in on the sidelines we've had cash in on the sidelines we always have cash on the sidelines August September and October yes we're looking to be by is one thing you have to understand about the markets right now\nYes the down and corrective territories which means about ten percent most of the stocks underneath underlying making up the index is already in bed markets\nWhere Facebook is\nLook at even Amazon look at a lot of the tech stocks look at three AM looked at a lot of the stocks in the dial that down a lot of stocks at the end Serbia down over twenty percent already\n\nIt's a little bit different than we had in two thousand eight two thousand they we had a situation where the banks were collapsing and there was selling that continued to go on today we have three things that are causing the markets to be nervous\nThe election\nRising interest rates in Paris\nWell you know a two way street elections are going to be done so the markets can deal with that we do know Sunday the terrorists are going to be all fixed we've already fixed it and dealing with Europe where you're already dealt with Mexico and Canada there's no way of China the biggest abusers of all of them all\nTrying to act as an emerging country and getting all those breaks for being a a emerging country when they got how many billions of people and how many people how much money they're getting from everybody else in the unbalanced trade\n\nNow there's some pain to pay to equal playing field\nBut how could they have the strongest economy how could they have the strongest army military as one of the top two or three ... uh uh countries in the world competing with us every day but yeah they're the emerging country and we have to foot the bill\n\nYes there's some pain I promise you that pain is a lot worse than ours\nWe\nWill prevail and that also\nBut in the meantime we have to go through some pay in here and it's not so much to terrorists the terrorists will reason why some of these companies are using for excuses he knew know that anytime that company wants to look up to the future they're going to tell you everything that can go wrong so they can surprise\nBut it's just in case it does affect them they already told you a year ahead of time that this could be the case\n\nBut they're not telling you is consumer spending is through the roof at the GDP it into is another three\nAnd a half percent these numbers that no one ever thought that we would get to or were there the economy is strong\nThe terrorists will be fixed interest rates will stop going higher or at least what's going to happen I think it's going to happen to probably raise one more time what ... saying we're going to be more\nLooking towards the information coming to us it's not going to be just yes we have to raise interest rates we've done that will be more sensitive\nTo market conditions inflation growth housing what's going on they're going to say I don't want to

get all pissed off that you'd be three hundred thousand dollars and now you only up a hundred and fifty\nWill spend it enjoy it do something with it because what happens is the markets will definitely go down\nTimes and that definitely go back up at times just a matter of time that's why it's long term investing you buy the good stuff you never put too much one stock you're diversify and it goes

this before we have not even seen the effects of that tax break yet they came in this year so when everybody starts in February and march and April in doing their taxes that's when they're going to feel the difference\nThat's when they're going to see some checks coming back that's when they're going to see another stimulus in this market as long as the markets don't act like they're going to blow up we keep spending and that\nThink that they can spend that things are going to be better we didn't have that for the last Fifteen Years were like okay I'm going to spend some money but I kind of keeps them on the side I got to pay down debt\nCorporation woman's picking out ten twenty Thirty years they were thinking out two three years\nWhen you have corporations sticking out that far

got a good economy\nLet's not blow it let's not screw this up\nOkay by now ... you know going ahead and changing everything let's keep going better and where we need to tweak it fix it and make it better but you do it and we won't can use more money\nEvery corporations should be able to make more money it helped everyone must be the wealthiest nation in the entire world by a long shot let's have the greatest military in the world by a long shot let people come to us and make decisions from there so we don't have to go do that\nYeah we're going to screw up and yeah we're going to give people money that don't deserve it we're going to give arms to people that are going to shoot the wrong people I get all that and that's probably that's the world and that's what's gonna happen because people aren't truthful\nBut let's start with us\nOkay and let's figure out what we need to do because our economy is good we don't want to blow it and let's make sure that everything else goes

I think I've ever in\nMy own ever put your hand in a bus to get a cough\nAnd now I Know one thing I can find out a rattlesnake means is very good very taste oh you'll eat it won't be around ... am on the merits like check on the line of it it's very similar to ... fried chicken was it was excellent as a matter of fact\nAt All right let's move on because that I can handle [laughter] what are we introduce improperly since you do such a good job with that\nNow with the introduction well I'm not sure that I'm going to go through the whole entire back story but Peter and I met um on the strength as New York I maybe I Need to tell the story because that sounds a little weird\nTo get it done so what you pay the idea that they will they see you later she was at that it had it a second job yeah [laughter]\nEverybody now is I think that listen to the show that we took um LA San our oldest daughter to New York for her high school graduation 'cause we talk about all this stuff all the time\nBut we were fortunate to me Peter giving an interview on the street tiny couldn't have been more perfect and I I\nWanted to get a picture with Peter [laughter] to send a team and ribbon and dad just meet him 'cause here all we see Peter as you on come on CNBC and they're always interviewing him and that nice nice traders jacket\nAnd we thought oh wow this is really add to that is just call and I said this is what we do for a living\nBut we ended up getting to know each other at you it took me down on the floor of the exchange I I've never I've been there and said\nYeah maybe middle school with my dad long time ago and I'm just a great experience I learned a lot you took a lot of time\nShowing my husband and I and my sister and Ali San ... around and watch the opening bell Sherrilyn Williams yeah that's right yeah you let me me Jim Kramer is that I was crazy 'cause I kept wanting to me and I said hey can I go meet nickel a pet ... from Fox yeah like whatever Natalie it's kind of took me around that\nBut he was right when you make Kramer and he didn't really need to was in that friendly\nNow it's not that he wasn't friendly and he was um it wasn't ... he's not like Peter very at not as outgoing I'm well here's here's\nAn inch river which is strange because you know when you see him on his show right he you would think he's a huge ... extrovert but he's not not he's not at all he's he's he's very shy his body language and that he\nNever which isn't there in the in the guy who will you know periodically but he always looks down and he's he's a very very not he's a very smart guy I don't know what I mean well given that he's he's a you know has a Harvard degree which we can argue about that but\n... said I I Know he um he is a very smart guy and he also has a I don't think he has a ... memory where you can remember everything you see but he has an incredible memory and he can pull up facts and and you know um discuss basically any company\nRight off the right off the bat it's not even like he has any kind of a preparation going into it you don't want to show they do tell them what company they're going to you know like when you call in they ask you what you're going to talk about and then they'll put the the stock symbol up on his screen and\nAs soon as he gets on the phone with you he's off to the races so you know he has a incredible memory in an incredible um you know he just he's very depths of his death of knowledge is is really unique so\nBut uh you know what I found that my career was that I went a lot I was horrible and in some aspects of the job that I was doing was mechanically I quit NATO subtract\nBut my from New how well I traded and my ... one of my two of my skill sets were relationships with people which down on the trading floor you needed to have that and I had a very good intuitive feel for markets are directions trends you know what I kept up on a lot of different\nUh different things with a lot of brokers didn't do like I Would understand we would be in certain stocks with trading certain companies and I would learn what the company did so you know when news came out in a particular\nPart of that industry I knew how it would impact the company that we you know we were trading so\nThere were a lot of things that you know [noise] I did that a lot of other brokers didn't do you know most of them just wanted to earn a living and they had you know you're really good living but they didn't really go the next step and I tried to so I think that that was one of the ... one of my head and values to my firm and to my clients so\nAnd what else we ought to know as a dog a king or so [laughter] I think that the sec scary off from going into fourth or you know what that was just my bigger issue was that I'm\nDefinitely allergic to poison ivy Mm I Know and I hate that some of my fear but that means we'll come back to the next section and you know what that is it's Dylan's domain [noise]\nYou're going to listen to him and talk about the GDP we'll be right back when I measure [noise]\n[noise]\n\nI look back here on Monday about a show it's a great show today we got guest all over the place we're talking about different things but\nBefore we go to Dylan's domain I got to congratulate the Wildcats catch plural Wildcats plural you'll have a great game last night and those of you that no\nAlso Kentucky Wildcats fans my son played Dylan played for him they won this evidence one they got a chance to win the FCC east by beating Georgia next week\nAs pretty darn good so we got very very happy while catch all over the studio today in many many reasons but I'll tell you one thing about that right Peter everyone complains I you know everyone's even everyone's ... when he was a hell of a lot\nBetter than losing who wants to be a loser now always has been right you you you lose again they don't get it out you know so much out here yet but like the SEC 'cause I Know you went to Tennessee they take losing to hot it feels horrible not that you go out and do something bad but it's All right\nYeah yeah and another game and that's why I think it matters so much when you do have a season I mean you've been around you know how bad Kentucky been for a long time and football rice is an amazing\nYear for the ... really is probably a ...\nRight but the microphone closer to your mouth he and I think he had it on its own but put it closer to turn it up there you go all the little things you gotta understand so now so now Mr wildcat Seventy one go ahead and uh the Dylan's domain\nAlright well today it's still wisdom and we're talking about GDP GDP was twenty four one trillion dollars and the second quarter US GDP is ...\nThe number one in the world currently and the and he was growth rate of ... percent between July of September\nWas what it was after the Fort ... in the previous quarter this was a one point two percent from this time last year but what is ... ... gross gross domestic product measures the value of all funneled goods and services produced in the country in a given period usually a quarter or a year when it's\nTalked about it includes all private and public consumption government outlays investments bribing inventory paid in construction costs and the foreign balance of trade\nThe calculation is C. plus jeep was I was an act which seagulls consumer spending gee equals government spending I equals country's total investment and and actually it was a total exports which means exports modest imports\nThere are two types of GDP it's nominal and real nominal GDP doesn't account for inflation or deflation resulting in higher GDP number\nUsed this is used when comparing different quarters of out but within the same year real GDP is calculated using the GDP priceless later which is the difference and the difference in price is between the current year and the base you an example of this is if prices rose five percent in the base here the plate or would be one point of the\nOverall ... real GDP is better index of expressing long term national economic from\nThe G empty is gross ... gross national product this different from the GDP that in that measures the production of levels of any American or American own business regardless of where the actual product is taking place so can be in Europe it could be an age it could be anywhere\nBut GPS important because is most common indicator of economic health of the country as well as a gauge of a country standard of living and there's also use to compare the productivity the productivity of various countries economists use GDP to keep track of how an economy is doing\nA decrease in the GDP means indicates recession in an increase in GDP indicates economic expansion\n[laughter] well ... ...\nPages so that ... well it ... not well yeah [laughter] good [laughter] the people that read by the time he was appalled player he's got their strong\n[laughter] to keep trying really strong what [laughter] so\nSo the GDP number helps the government make decisions whether to simulate a stagnant economy by putting money into it or slow down economy that's getting overheated businesses use of GDP figure to decide how to expand her contract or contract their production and other business activity\nAnd that was also maintenance we've got a very good down ... to look up I Will do the research has and get it back\nThat was good I learned something someone see I didn't I didn't know the formula do you know the woman who now I did not have you know the\nForm you know I knew the formula but I had never use it\nThat's why I didn't know it good jobs ... you get better every week that's good so ten years or twenty eight years like we've been doing this you'll hopefully it'll be good yeah let me ask\nYou this question ... from a GDP standpoint\nWhat what do you know what signals a recession from the release of GDP numbers quarter to quarter what that what the definition is ever recession as it relates to GDP solely slowing down or if it's selling down\nFive if it was lower than that right\nThey look at too or negative quarter of negative GDP is from a GDP standpoint that's officially a recession\nAnd I don't think if we keep trumping that we're gonna have to worry about it or not\nClose to negative right now but there are other signals have session and there are other there are other economic\nData points that will signal you're headed that way but from the GDP standpoint it's back to back ... negative quarterly GDP numbers\nYour job doing I got to get a question for you Peter yes do stocks anticipate a recession did they tell you when you watch the stock market and say we're going to have a recession\nA well I mean a lot of people would like to think they could but not every indicator is you know it works one of the things that I found is that when you look at the housing numbers\nOr you know new homes existing homes if the sales and those two categories start pulling back\nInconsistent following months I think it's like three months generally a recession will be it's not far off but what if it's a cause because they wage enjoyed instrument because you're even raise interest rates and caused a recession do it's usually housing is is one of the best indicator is over a potential looming recession\nOr you know we didn't see that in two thousand and seven\nBut there were other factors in two thousand seven that caused this we're almost in a recession at that point I Believe and the banks were you know on the verge of failing all the way across the board shows was that was a cataclysmic more cataclysmic type of thing but generally the recession so we've had over the last forty years they\nStart with housing\nBlowback and then I and as such with raising interest rates are they do anything would raise the kind of stopped for a little bit I think you're kind of making then make didn't actually watch normally markets do very well Seattle rising interest rates are what we have some other things to talk about too with the liquidity if they go into ... we have some good things to talk about the next hour stay tuned in some money out of the show [noise]\n\n\nFrom the region will studio your local area for you dot com is fantasy instead of a nice yard radio station [noise]\nHey translate not have a place anywhere I'm Pam who sales Fox News the words of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill to do though as his city mourns the loss of eleven people who was shot and killed while worshipping at a Senate cod\nAnyway a e as a letter of the week we're gonna talk it was a busy week of earnings economic\nReleases energy you know we got the mid term elections coming up emerging markets we can throw in there as well um I'm gonna try to keep this shorter than I normally do because I Would rather listen to the extrovert\nI'm In my ear a because there's a lot to learn from Peter from the floor um anyway in trouble\nThe way and I'm a you had to throw that in just 'cause he likes during the ... I Know here from the floor\nAnd anyway uh you know the market had a rough week there's no doubt about it I think we were down about four percent on average and almost\nA on all the indexes I don't know whether it was the investor enthusiasm that petered out whether it was as ... as screens ... Greenspan said back in a in the nineties or this irrational like ... I don't think we're at that point but maybe\nA things were a little too exuberance\nBut anyway the earnings that came out really driven by four companies you know we have caterpillar and three M company report on Tuesday and that drove the market down for five hundred points or so and then on that we recovered Wednesday and then on on Thursday um we had a excuse me\nIt was Wednesday Thursday Friday there\nOn on Thursday we had um Amazon and Google come out earnings were good but their sales were below what expectations were and uh you know the market fell apart against so those are words through most of of will not most were through with about half of\nThe earnings that are going to come out um and according to facts at the third quarter a forty eight percent of the companies that the S. and P. five hundred of reported\nSeventy seven percent of the S P five hundred companies are have reported positive surprises at fifty nine percent of reported positive sales surprises so the numbers are still good or the earnings growth is at twenty two point five percent\nI'm In the uh originally I think expectations were that they would grow at about Nineteen percent\nSo they're going faster than what the expectations were we still have a number of them to report the revenue growth what's up seven point six percent that's a little bit lower this quarter than the last quarter\nAnd the valuation Peter I know you used a different ... but the forward twelve month PE ratio a is Fifteen point five percent that continues to come down I think a last quarter we were up around the Seventeen point seven or so\nSo um it'll be another busy wake up learning and we'll see where that takes us\nUm as far as the economy goes\nA Dell and talked about the GDP number that came out uh what's it for three three and a half percent which was better than expected I think the one of the key factors that came out of there was the measure of inflation that the fed uses it was a one point six percent\nWhich was lower than the two point two percent that was expected by economists\nAnd consumer spending grew by four percent a third quarter that's another key factor there we also had durable goods orders come out on earlier in the wake increased point eight\nTenths of a percent September that was that third gain in the last four months and they had been forecasting a one point nine percent dropped so\nThat number added a little um\nEnthusiasm to the ... the economic numbers\nThe consumer sentiment is still very high in Ninety eight point six percent in October barely off its eyes so the two year treasury is a two point eight one percent at the end of the week the ten year at three point oh eight\nThe thirty year a three point three to money flowed from the equity market end of the bond markets a that spread a between the two and a ten year roommates at twenty seven\nBasis points that's still not really ... you know a a a recession here\nNow [noise] what are some of the effects of rising rates on the pipelines we have a lot of people that own the pipelines and in our accounts a rising interest rates if they continue to move up\nThere becomes an alternative to investing in these Hi Devon empires\nAnd of course borrowing costs rise as well so if you're on the pipelines you know just to make sure that you're not over\nExtended in any one any one of them the emerging markets um had a terrible year the market cycle quotes that we look at case only are there at the bottom of the list as far as an asset class\nOr through the end up September or the emerging markets are down seven point seven percent after being up thirty seven point three percent in two thousand Seventeen so there's been a little correction there we know that what's that's the bottom eventually it's gonna work its way towards\nThe top maybe not the top but it'll work itself up\nA there's a the word emigrate\nImmigrate how do you say that\nNot immigrate with an eye with any immigration\nAndme ethnically\nAnd eat him as a big move for a lot of people from Honduras and while I'm a ... one of my life been caravan\nNo [laughter] but they're not they want to have a lot of emigrate\nAnd to the United states so ah you know that that's going to continue to unfold I think they're still march I expect a lot of them are going to give up\nThe waiting to what a next weekend right before the election they're way down there just north of the bag it on the door there just\nNorth of the border of of a of a\nDown a lot out there and it's hard to Mexico and so a long way away the elimination since seven eight days\nSo anyway bottom line here is to examine your shopping list for equities because they're on sale I think a Peter maybe can tell us more about what he thinks the markets so let's get back to Mr Peter\nYour job extremely ones [laughter] same spores as a ... I had from Batman was a ... [laughter]\nThis is right into this very like I'd rather be picked up on it was all excited now their pita for the head and said right along with them sound the inlet on air today Peter this\n... letter of the de sac then is probably one of the most popular amongst our listener I can\nSee why there are a lot of ... lover then they don't like to Sesame Street songs we've had if you can I say that we've had a lot\nThat don't complain and without that than non complaints far outweigh the complaints and you know we came up with that Sesame Street one weekend didn't deem lesson here and we kind of thought it was funny when he came back we played it as a joke and then it just Stockley kinda kept going with\nThat now that I think it's great for a very long time now probably a couple of years ago on some music for Dylan's domain through family too you know that when you could do something ... one of the really wanted bonded on songs yeah well Bob Dylan song Rolling Stone ...\nHas set looking and find something or a role in selling and when you look as a\nAs a traitor watching the markets talk about Peter what you see when you see this type of volatility that has picked up and we've seen October is historically a very volatile months to begin with but\nWith everything going on there's obviously biggest concern now is when is the recession going to come when does everything in a bottom out because we're in such a long bull market\nI'm very different\nBull market position today because of the politics and Trump being elected and a new push the fiscal policy but what you see I mean you've done this a long time\nYou know one of the things is that I don't get scared and I and I think again it said it before you don't get scared the ... these ... I mean this is a little bit more than what we've seen in the last seven or eight years but it's still\nYou know there are opportunities you're talking about just saw this in February not as bad as this some time to do this this is this is different I mean these are you know it in February was you know a hundred and fifty three hundred point moves maybe a five hundred point to move and then it it it and they used to find them up right away I mean it didn't carry over\nThis is the type of market that's going to be like this for a while and ... one of the reasons and I think that\n\n\n\nFox

of the New York stock exchange with thirty seven years that was a lot going on\n\nGood stuff in bed so let me ask you a question yes\nWe talked about this the other day we'll talk about the I'll go with them trading everyone sees that they don't understand it um\nObviously it exasperated markets in both directions but here it heads is the next thing you know goes down which when I see that that's when you don't sell you look for being a buying opportunity to go from there to ... ... talk a little bit more from the floor perspective of what you see when this happens\nWell you know what we um with our clients what we would do is whenever the situation when it happened where you start seeing that type of trading in in that\nIt it almost seems like it's a panic selling but it's not because there's not anybody on the other end panicking it's a computer models that are designed to\nUm sell out of certain positions at certain prices and as a tick through these prices they sell out more shares so what we would advise our clients to walk away let the market do what it's gonna do\nCome back in ... markets a little more stable when they're the the price fluctuation slice price fluctuations [laughter] that was last night\nComing down again make out there where you go to Bob\nDylan everybody yeah All right um yeah so what happens is the price fluctuations would a moderate and that's where we would bring our clients back and so we'd never participate in those movements because they\nYou know in in this is an old adage on Wall street that I basically road is that everyone is a genius only when the market's going up and there were no geniuses on the ... when the market's going down so\nYou know you let the market go where it's going to go when it's selling off and then you pick your spots and I think that goes with individual investors as well I think that's a smart move\n\nIt's hard and you know that it I think one of the things that our clients will call and ask\nPeople that listen to the show is\nIt exactly that and they get caught up in ... should I Do something here we we said a couple of weeks ago you know try to catch a falling knife no you don't even need to buy and we've had people ... what are you dealing we're not doing anything relating this thing's settled we're not going to panic out of that stuff\nBut we also we need to see where it settles him where it goes you've got a good plan\nUm you know and when you're dealing with that with the\nRetail investor and individual investor and this is their IRA they said their retirement money to take a monthly income you've gotta practice some discipline when these markets yeah as you would you agree from that standpoint that it's set in motion you said you don't get emotional yeah I don't know ... people be a whole ...\nEmotional ... yes they generally do hurt people and what if there's not an institutional fundamental reason for the market or stock to be going in a direction that it's going and\nThen you say the hell away from it I actually I mean that's that's the bottom line is that\nWhen you had two thousand seven two thousand they when the market went down to fifty eight percent of whatever the number was there was a fundamental reason why\nThe market and the economy was acting the way it was acting and that was there was a legitimate reason to get out but if a if a company is selling off because the markets selling off you know one and a half percent it is not any underlying fundamentally\nA fundamental reason why company is going you know prices going down like that you stay away from it because they're you know that could just be some sort of electronic trading or an algorithm that has just you know decided on load you just let it go I mean they're not you\nKnow I Would say probably Ninety percent of the time you're the bounce back as is bounces back to its original initial level or or\nDo you have a strategy on the upside of the market as opposed to the downside of volatility when you look at a stock that's arriving you look at in the Amazon you look at a Microsoft you look at it as\nIf Facebook from ... you know that I peeled at forty and dropped and gets to two hundred which what is your perspective or strategy to the upside\nI mean what the first thing is you know if I get into anything it's generally something I Know I'm you know I've I've advised people for thirty five years you invest in what you know\nAnd you know you know certain companies if you work for a company or if you have somebody who works for you know rock well ... and you know they're doing well they have what is coming out the you know dig in young\nYou know the company is going to do well so that that's my first rule of investing is to know the company you're investing in\nA generally on the upside what I Try to do is I Try to you know you can't time these things even those people think that you can I think they're trying to time in a move or down moving any stock is is is an fool's gold I mean it's a fool's errand it's just\nYou'd normally don't it normally doesn't work that well\nSo what I Try to do is I Try to average into certain things by like a company and I see that there's a there's an up with a momentum and up we're biased I'll Try to average into it I'm not going to go in all in at the very beginning I mean there are some people strategy they do\nA mind is more about averaging and it was over a certain period of time and also you know in that averaging into something that you believe if you look at a company and you say well I really like this I like this six month than a year prospect and you take a week or two weeks the by even if you're buying small\nYour average price is probably going to be right around the average with the stock moving up\nAnd they'll be opportunities there'll be potential arbitrators by maybe a little bit of itchy because of just because of market generation so you try to keep an average going and I mean it's a safe way as little as ... as a little less risk on it and you know my age now I'd like to be a little less risky\nWhat about accepting ...\nPeter yes I think you're one of our client that's likely to well I mean you know [laughter] ... that's the reason people use you know\nI Know we didn't ... says no no I mean but that's it's like you know people use a from like yours because you're you know your firms interest is their interest is ride your interest is there so\nBut yeah I mean it it's it it's almost\n... you know some people say that kind of investing his archaic but I think it's actually works very well you know you have to be very careful and there are opportunities will always be opportunities to buy something a little bit cheaper but you know at some point you want to be fully invested in whatever it is you're looking at and there's a reason why and that reason is something you're looking for something that's going to happen in a week\nOr that's not really invested in that ... you know over long term it's invested you\nKnow I think people individuals get very distracted in ... by because of technology and media news because it's a non stop cycle we've we've given the advice many times on the shell of\nBe aware of what's going on but if it's on all day long and rich and every and it I Can't remember what it might it now is that ... recession it

that fees and everything of come so low you can do use technology to take care of business\nAnd that's a benefit to investors that's a benefit to investors\nSo going back to the market's going back to where we are\nFlat and now we have the\nThe election and it's just so interesting that the Democrats\nRules the house and Senate would think that it's going to go down and if the fed and the Republicans keep the house in the Senate we think it's going to go up that just shows you the differences in policies and how clear it is a policies that drives the economy\nDown if you're one of those type people that just think capitalism is bad and capitalist so horrible and people that are successful uh uh pigs you know\nThen you're right I get it I get why you go the other way I come from the decide that you work hard it's okay to be successful\n... ballots to be successful\nI'm not embarrassed that I've worked hard that the people that work for me work hard there's so there's no problem with that why should we be embarrassed we help people every day we get back every day\nTo help other people be successful to understand to move forward\n\nI don't hide behind it it takes time and effort and and and and experience the fact that I got people in my office that have been around thirty five forty years tells you something about what I Believe in\nI Believe and experience it helps you get through all the problems we have barest about being successful no we'll continue to be successful but it's\nCrazy to me listening to all these people that even more successful multimillionaires all these Hollywood people all these tech people all these people out there that claim\nThey want it to the other way they don't they're the biggest capitalist in the world\nThey won't sign a contract for less money these football players that want to nail all the time and and and everything else in a you know I get it and it's about social injustice right but rather than doing something about it they want to just say it and do it\nBut yet they're not gonna go and play it better than they should get less money\n\nEverybody that gets money complains about taxes and then I hear why don't mind paying more taxes\nAs long as it's going to get right into you do get to have to pay more taxes than you complain about them so why don't we just put a strain on the table\nIf you make money it's okay to pay taxes just pay a lower percentage\nThis is what the craziest thing is if you're making a hundred thousand dollars and you're paying thirty thousand dollars in tax or thirty percent in taxes right you're paying thirty grand and taxes now because everything is so much better you make two hundred thousand and you only pay twenty five percent in taxes\nYou're paying fifty thousand to the government and taxes that's twenty percent more you are paying taxes in Dallas\nBut instead of paying the other way it would have been six they can pay twenty five but no one understands this part you would not be making that much more money if you didn't have a good economy if people citizens didn't have money to spend on what they need\nIt they didn't have money they didn't have jobs they can't pay money to do the other things so right now everyone I Know it was making more money\nEverybody\nIncluding the people that started in the restaurant business what may making minimum wage at six seven dollars an hour ten years ago\nNow making twelve Thirteen fourteen dollars they're all making more money\n\nI get it if you make less money doesn't get to spend as much as the person that's making more money I understand that but whose fault is that\n\nThe people that are making minimum wage I've not done most of the things you need to do that other people's Don and taking risk and go into colleges and and going to get jobs I'm working and doing the things you need to do not all but most\n\nIn the restaurant business so that was in and I hope never to be in it again the bottom line is the people in the kitchen in the back off that\nMany of them were from drug rehab\nComing out of jail\nSo these are jobs that they needed and now instead of making six seven eight dollars an hour they're making eleven twelve Fifteen dollars an hour\n\nBut do you think they ... they did they look at it any different than they did before no and that's where the problem is\nIn our society\nAlways going to have people at the lower end and people at the higher end and the people at the higher when like these movie stars in east Texas\nWho want to help all the lower people which we all do but I Want to help them any idea it given them the ability to be better to for them to believe in success for them to understand how to be better than what they're doing and make more money\nThat's what I Believe and I don't believe in just giving it to them\nIf they're able bodied but not able bodied was take care of everybody\nIf they need assistance let's take care of them I'm okay with all that but somebody that would rather just sit and get a check them work I'm not about that never happened never will be\nI get it some people have the ability and the background and just by the way the the born to do better when life I get that I also get the fact that there is other changes that we have made with box checking\nThat helps others and other races to help others so that the level goes down a little bit and I'm okay with that I\nUnderstand that comic backgrounds\nBut I don't understand is the philosophy that has gone away growing up I've always remembered by grandparents saying their parents wanted them to be better my father ... parents says I Want you to be better than them and my parents said to me I Want you to be better than us\nI'm here to make you better I'm here to support you know I was the first one in my whole entire family to go to college\nOkay\nBecause that's what they wanted that work for the phone company and they were nervous but they save money for me to go\nIf things as much as we know what's wrong that's their life\nAnd then\nWe still have to get along with them so however this works out I'm Glad I'm not the one having to make the decision because on the surface you want to tell Saudi Arabia I'm done with the\nThen how does that affect the world\nThey messed up we all know they messed up we don't believe in that but my question to you if you think it happens here\n\nRemember whitewater and Clinton all of a sudden people turned up dead no investigation but it happens it happens because the power don't know how to get people\nHappens all the time in trials people who threaten Joe is even though it's illegal witnesses go missing\nWe know it's illegal without a body without saying what do you do\nI'm not saying what happened is right it's totally wrong in much said when they do it here was right or wrong but it happens but when you do it on the world stage different\n\nNobody's perfect we are not perfect\nBut I Know this once we start changing our whole frame of mind about what we're doing and we're starting to do that now remember this\nWhen you have to look at the Democrats and worry about the markets we tracing what we've done and our economy is slowing and taxes going up and people spending money and corporations not being able to think about the future\nVersus the party that the economy's doing well people have money it's so much easier to get things done socially and and at all when things are good\nIt's not that easy to do when things are bad and people can have enough money to pay for their kids' education or the food on the table ought to be able to go ever go on vacation or to fix their car or to do anything else that they need to do\nThat's not the world we want to live and we want to live and the other world when you go out and people are happy because things are getting done\nThey have some extra money sitting around and things are doing way they want it we get all that and the economy's good all these things go on the problem we have is we'll worry about all these video or ideology problems\nAt home we detect on judgment if you're going to have a country of ... a country that has so many different religions and so many different races in so many different backgrounds who always to say someone should do something\nWe should never tell someone that can\nBelieve in Jesus of God and we can never say someone shouldn't believe in the Muslim religion do the Jewish religion but however we do things\nBut we need to do is become accepting of it all\nAnd working together and not putting the other people down [noise]\nWe'll be back this is the money manager [noise]\n\n\n\nFox News on that he hand like President Trump says the vote for

back down and really at the end there was all flat again\nBattling it tried to go higher on outstanding issues you mentioned\nThat in your monologue but on Tuesday when they had the jolt report that was Tuesday right these weeks yes five days seemed to\nLately there's so much going on and so much news and so much happening and a lot of volatility here in October that you almost forget which day things were but\nTuesday was a very big rally the Dow was up over five hundred points almost five hundred and fifty points on the news of the jokes are port and that was a big big deal dean you mentioned that\nUm earlier but over seven million job openings and they are not enough people out there to fill them\nAnd um you know we've never been in this position in the economy when we talk about strength in America and for Americans I was reading a headline this morning that the Democrats if if elected if they take over you know their goal is to cut the uh\nIncrease the taxes back it rid of the tax breaks\nAnd start giving more handouts back it's and it just seems so opposite of what is good for this country when you have jobs that cannot be filled it seems like the better thing to do is turn this into a pro education\nI'm working opportunity there's all these things you can do if you live here in America\nThere's jobs but you got to figure out how to go get them people can't do it you're not going to have them handed over to you but go and start looking go to where it get educated in the places you need to be educated we talk about it in the office of\nAbsolutely an example you know wherever they're marketing JC penny the Web and marketing shares you know for and you can go through a number of those Facebook Facebook are there are a number of companies that you can have that twenty percent down so you can pick individual companies to use a shorter by\nUm or sectors for that matter are sectors that fried but when we talk in general route in general about bowling Baron markets on the market or talking about the whole you know the S P five hundred for example\nAnd the doubt and then that's right and the bottom line is that is why we always say you need to have some indexes and your portfolio why because they will go up all the time\nMaybe the stocks won't like if you have Facebook and that's that could be making new highs but Facebook isn't making it into high it's in the bear market and the reason it is as we know when the Dow what did they do they rotate the stocks out\nRather not performing and they put in stocks performing which always gives them the ability to go hire\nMe ask you a question if the market was down ... percent yes if we were in a better market mhm let's say friday we turned into a bear market right would we be bearish no but you wouldn't be wrong and be embarrassed by the by the definition of what a you know a a bear market\nSo I don't listen to that if I'm going to be buried show going to be berets Wilma crossing through the correction line of ten percent and try to as a tax write what is going down ... past twenty you might hold off of that you're looking for fighting opportunity\nNot selling All

response to thank you everybody\nDylan you think that you kind of like the first one that came in ... it makes you smile when you say and if you are very happy and something about it that that resonated with you know everybody gave us some very good suggestions\nAnd Tom we may have to change it up at some point but I think we're going to stick with Dylan's domain\nAnd the goal of this segment is every week Dell and will prepare\nIt kind of a breakdown in layman's terms of\nAn economic report or a term that we use on the show or that we use in the markets when talking about the economy and give them a little bit easier to understand explanation of what it is what it means why it's important et cetera\nSo Dylan we do not have it at Sesame Street song to bring you in it's just that pain and now dealings domain to take it away\nOh thank you well this week we're talking about retail sales report that came out on Monday morning retail sales for September ... five hundred nine billion dollars which was a point one percent increase from August or from September\nAnd four point seven percent higher than September of two thousand Seventeen total sales from July two thousand Eighteen through September to those Eighteen were five point nine percent from the same time period or a year ago\nBut what do retail sales even ... so retail sales are among the economic indicator that covered the previous month is combined measure of the cells of retail goods in store\nCatalogs and out of store sales over state of beard this measure is based on a monthly data sample from roughly fifty five hundred retail and food service firms in the United states the sample is supposed to be a representation of the entire country\nRetail sales or an indicator of the pulse of an economy and its projected path towards an expansion or contraction this is because retail sales are miserable consumer demand for finished good\nWhy is this important retail Sears sales are important because consumer spending accounts for two thirds of the gross domestic gross domestic product in the United states\nThis major retail sales major indicator of economic health in the U.S also means that any extended drop off in retail spending can trigger a recession by lowering tax receipts and forcing companies to reduce their workforce\nRetail socks become\nMore volatile during periods when retail sales reports are released because individual retail companies are also released their own sales figures at the same time each month and it and investors to all the data and tried to process what it's telling them in a stronger economy annual retail sales rose by about three percent\nThis four point seven percent increase from last September to December indicates that the United states is having a strong\nEconomy for that is ... very good\nRetail sales how much you can contribute to that number that way\n[laughter] [noise] I\n... I'm a I'm a contributor but I'm probably a contributor along with\nWith others but I I can be quite at that\nSaid you said it breaks down how many fifty five hundred\nTo take a sample of about fifty five hundred retailers like Amazon included in that\nIn one of those numbers are they didn't specify [noise] but it's more like I think it's more a local of the guy go around the country right states gay humor\nWill get fat I'm sure different um different areas and you know allow rate of getting that feel\nRetail sales is one of the recession rush\nIndicators ... and you said as you said it's positive right now yeah right I was\nAbout [noise] what's it also tied to Russia is investor confidence to write in K\nIf investors are confident about what's going on and do we have just all time high investor confidence\nConsumer confidence Schumer okay is that what you mean yes I I've just double checking that adventure in butler that's why I Know what you're talking about you do but everybody listening might nighttime at consumer confidence and yes they do\nBecause you if you believe things are good you'll spend today because you know you'll get it\nTomorrow and that's where we have the economy today in corporations have you ever saw corporations in the last Fifteen Twenty years actually twenty actually be doing what they're doing today planning for future not only three four or five years but twenty Thirty years from now\nThey're doing things for long term success and that's what we finally have the different and most people don't get why that is important but it is they're not worried about just holding on an audience\nI should say how do we spend this case was willing to keep getting cash as we keep making money\nAnd it should grow that way and that's what how the why our economy's going the other thing is everyone so worried about China and well things are going to look at Mexico everyone would talk to about people that have a\nManufacturing in Mexico it booming they they can't even keep up with all the production that they need to do down there because of what's happening\n\nWhat talking nothing either often okay [laughter] yeah you know and and and that goes back to\nOur a sales numbers everything that we have going on just keeps getting better and better\nAnd I don't I don't want to ...

talk with us we were right before the break getting into talking about some local issues things that we face and we're dealing with here\nIn Tucson and the differences of the growth and the the lack of recovery or the the lagging recovery in Tucson compared to the Phoenix area\nHost um the recession back in two thousand eight and nine so we got cut off by that [laughter] that's right the news or you were beginning to talk about about that process from your perspective and what you've seen Phil and when I was explaining\nWas I was appointed by governor do see the culture that is on heroes which is a business attraction a CEO group for the state of Arizona I culture with Michael ... who's the president of theirs and the cardinals and I think governor do see lives very\nCreative innovative entrepreneurial when it came to how do we attract business to the state of Arizona by using the super bowl the final four some of these great sports events that we've had unfortunately majority of them in Phoenix uh but to attract a CEOs from California and other places that are not as attracted to do business\nWe've had great success in recruiting those businesses to Arizona\nBut we need to do is shift how do we get more of those obviously to Pima County ... county and I'm very aware of that and we've had some great success in Pima County recently with uh the Amazon logistics center which is led the port of Tucson it took the risk and lead on you've got hexagon mining caterpillar has been a huge development\nUm and I think from any perspective any community it's looking at the assets that your community has and then using that for recruitment in southern Arizona perspective especially in Pima County that's around logistics and mining um coach he's county the strength there is really for what you've got\nOur army posts are just part of this district and so much of the economy coaches county depends on that bringing more that focus a defense contractors and others has been key um but each communities facing that a Maricopa County on fire and the rest of us are kind of catching up\n[noise]\nYeah it's um over the years I mean it's obvious that we got hit much harder than Phoenix or that the recovery that was the lab was there you're starting I I mean you can feel it in ... and development\nKind of everywhere but we want to be Tucson as a business owner as business people as you know being involved in a community raising families here we want to see those opportunities\nFor kids that are going to the university jobs that are available so they don't leave so they'll come and go to school and then leave right that there are transitions and ...\nAnd you gotta think were sixteen days out from a vitally important election what I'm hoping folks that are listening are thinking about as I Am local I serve on way too many barge my husband will tell you but just a lot of activity a visit Tucson board you know and been leading our chamber of commerce for the last nine years\nI'm hoping that people choose local instead of someone who is a career politician has moved down here to run 'em she is not aware of all the nuances and the history and uh you know just the the activity to challenge shut in Arizona\nI'm even some of the media has come out saying she just has to learn southern Arizona well that's ridiculous don't we want someone representing us that do southern Arizona and has that network in those connections\nSo I've been part of a damn fifty the southern Arizona defense alliance talking about the importance of our military more than five billion dollars of economic impact year vitally important to this district in southern Arizona and on and on we can talk more about my front issues but I'm I'm hoping that that people will choose to elect local\nIn an elected me a CD to a congressman\nBut we hope so too thank you [laughter]\n[noise] All right\nHow old are good to be able to ... sure because you're such a nice person and feel while you messed up in this crop of politics\n[laughter] you know everyone down I Know it ... it ... I've never run for office before\nUh jumped into this race and yeah you're right it's interesting to live through this life experience and see all the crazy ads that people just make stuff up I mean true lies and hypocrisy\nIn this advertising and mail and I'm I'm saving them because I'm going to look out funny this is or whatever uh but you're right people can say anything I what I'm hoping is that my reputation in my experience and the network I've had throughout the region will speak for itself or don't\nJust those are just the people you know on the ...\nWhen the people that know me they love me\nPeople that don't know me they say things that I don't even know me but they said horrible things\nAnd it's one of the and you go through life and you get tough students but it's like why do you want to go through\nThis as a politician when they tear you apart they come up with wise remake exaggerations you don't even know where it comes from because somebody says something you've got to be true and and they showed they always have ... I don't think I Would say\nThe ... oh you know we're going to come up with something even though we know nothing about it but you hear something from somebody and then they run with it yeah and I don't get it I don't understand how we got into this this horrible place unless it's always been there\nAnd the social media and twenty four hour news there have to fill all those things I have to talk about instead of the the the actual subjects\nAnd social media certainly plays a huge role in this but I but why am I doing this and kind of in light of the other political divisiveness and things going on is I I Want to serve I Want to be able to have an impact and when I\nResearch and gather data from my community and then and then vote on an issue that I can actually have impact on congressional districts who are in southern Arizona on my home I've been able to do that so far as the chamber president weighing in at the city to state the county level because we get very involved\nBut how much more uh could I serve in and provide to find the Congress person\nBut you are one vote what I Need you to do\nIs to be able to be a leader where you're buying and people over the head and getting other boats\nTo get a lot of sheep and politics and then you get some leaders and everyone does it it's going to become wishy washy in critical to stay where that they are yeah I'm tired of those that are like an independent thinkers okay I hate flake but at least she would come up with something to buy really believed they believed what he said it wasn't just doing it\nBut okay I respect that I respect opinions on people if you really believe it or not you're doing it right for for what they'll\nDo what you've got to weigh in on me and my background of lay of iron your vote is that what's my experience I've been a problem solver in this community in southern Arizona I take an initiative here I've worked with whoever it takes to get something done I Am that independently minded Republican running for the seat a week ago issued by issue I don't think we have enough time on your show\nBut we can go issue ... on things that I Want to\nGet Charlotte number

in hosting the money matters show which we've been doing for twenty\nEight almost Thirty years\nStarted in Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen Ninety off and on\nAnd we started doing our own show\n\nThe market's dropped over four percent this week\nDidn't even give you one of these signs didn't give you any hands it just\nDid it and everyone thought that it was going to come back especially the day we were down over eight hundred points and just didn't then the next day we started up boom right back down we dropped another five hundred and some odd points\nNext day\nOpened up four hundred when all the way back down about a hundred came back up two hundred and something back to the all the way back down backup backed down back up and finished up almost three hundred or two hundred and eighty seven points to the upside\nThat's volatility\nAnd how old are you combat volatility you combat volatility by being a smart investor don't look at the short run look at the long term position yourself according to your risk tolerance position yourself\nTo make money dumping greedy when the markets and making new highs have cash on the sidelines prepare yourself or the markets do this this is the second time this year they do it two maybe three times a year with the markets will fall off and give you what I considered great opportunities\nNow does that mean you just buy one is going down oh you don't jump in with both the you might be\nPicking at some stocks\nThat you might not have any portfolio adding to it like I did with Amazon the other day on Thursday before friday\nYou look for good quality companies that come down and you put money into it it could drop even more\nBut if I'm buying it with the idea that I think these companies are going to have good earnings that we're going to go much higher than you use these opportunities and not worry about a month to month it's going to happen but as you see\nOver time the markets go higher\nOver time the markets makes new highs over time things turn out to be good even though in the short run we could have what we have right now so if you listen to wash\nOver this time you reduce your exposure to ask you made sure you took the test the risk alive so you knew that your portfolio and you were in sync together and then there's the markets fell he yeah you're either born or you now have cash\nThe first thing is if anyone had any investors on those it was a good day to probably come out of them or at least ... we came out of all of them\nNot because I thought the market would bounce right away or go down I just thought we were really oversold and I think we can have a little bounce which we started on friday and go higher now here's the opportune time that I'm looking for but being the buyers opportunity\nWhere the casually have on the sidelines that we set aside will be reenacted reinvest it\nThe markets come down you don't know where the bottom is you just don't maybe we hit the bottom able we didn't I knew we were on the short term basis oversold\nMaybe put ten Fifteen twenty percent of your money into some things you like that you took off the table before the markets will rally maybe it's a day to day five days who knows maybe that goes straight backup you usually don't see a V. bottom like this\nWhat usually happens is you come all the way down hard like we did we ... we make a lower high then we come down and we make a low in low a higher level I'm Sorry a high and low that's what I'm looking for\nIs the next week trace mint\nDo we come down and read test\nWhich is okay if we don't break it or do we come back\nDown and we don't we test and then we turn up\nIf it that one I liked\nThat and I liked that well especially when it breaks out of how high we go on this trip this is a very very important on a technical basis something I'm looking for we come down we've got down to almost\nTwenty seven I think it was twenty seven ten on the S. and P. five hundred twenty seven sixty seven percent we get to twenty eight fifty on this rally okay then we come back down again and several you only get to twenty seven fifty\nOn it and then we start turning backup if we break twenty eight fifty that is a sign to get back in the market again\nAnd move higher and I don't mean just for fifty hundred\nPoints on talking about okay we put in this correction here we go so what sustains behind that that's just a technical you need the fundamentals\nYou need the fundamentals the fundamentals\nOf most of the geo political political problems that we're having\nNow I Know you're listed out there there's all these guys the market's going down forty percent it's going down fifty percent if you live your life that way\nYou in trouble it can do it\nAnd it has done it and look we're all standing we\nAll have gotten through two thousand one and two thousand eight\nI Know when the markets go down you look at it and say oh man I'm too old for this I Can't lose my money here I Can't do this I Can't do that and you're right then you'd never sit your portfolio all the way it needs to be\nYou didn't take the risk allies you didn't match it up if you can't handle it because if you put all your money in the bank and you would take you out five six percent a year you would be down\nYou would have been draining a lot more than you take out as these markets go hide because you had no chance over the last ten years for appreciation none zero\nIf you put your money in the bank and you were earning a half a percent one percent\nIf you were lucky and still taking that out so you knew you were going to lose four or five percent a year we use this way you can get it and dividends you can get it in interest yes your principles gonna fluctuate no doubt about it and if you keep taking it out\nYou are going to drain and you're going to see your portfolio go down over time\nBut if you do it like you're not going to outlive your portfolio and when I said do it right you set up a plan and you don't take out more than that you know to go take it out three four five percent now and all of a sudden you need a fifty thousand dollars more yes you can get that but if you don't want to just something else you're going to have less money\nWhen you start raising it talking about doing more for more next year you know then you're bringing up the uh the

everybody's got to pay more so now that we've got these quote the tax break we're not going to get any tax break if we're going to depend on on other things\nBut I still believe the economy's going to draw\nA full of kids who go to go higher if we stop worrying about the things we don't need to worry about and we need to worry about um if we keep raising interest rates compared to everyone else

today right O L\nNo okay I just I don't know if it could\nBe could be we have a new such a a section today you know we do yeah you you and not only came up with it for ... we've got to come up with a name for it though we don't know what it is and I think maybe we should put it out there maybe somebody will come in with a good idea\nThat's a great idea yeah they'll have a listener named the next segment you want to describe the segment I think you should have some\nKind of like we had we had somebody in last week that names his cars so we each got thinking about getting a new one where he doesn't know what to name it so we're having a little bit of a contest to find a name helping him\nYeah but you have to tell you how do you need to get me a new name something before you eat it and sit in it and we know what it's going to sound like you're you're having like a baby oh there's a boy or girl that's going to do it\nAll kind of ... we already know exactly what the cart is\nYes you're on the color yet the car color ... the feel right we now kind of what the drive behind the name is so we're just exploring some different ideas\nBut on this will be a great and you can respond back on our Facebook page at Greenberg finance ... financial group you can email us you could call last\nBut semi names potential names for Dylan's news segment but several people have asked us over the over the shows that we do\nIf we can and I I really had one person asked\nYou specifically can we do one show where we break everything down\nUm we can hear that dean we can hear your phone\nOf [laughter] a turn off your phone or your Facebook Live I was was while we're alive and get the comments that are coming through and through them what you do you have to turn off your volume this again things were teaching on an older than I care about re Ellen ... highly you about all the technology yeah\nWell it fails and how to shut it all ... I couldn't hear it [laughter] and we can all you're at and say okay everybody else on the show\nSo anyway there was some ... questions and request to take some of the topics some of the verbiage that we use some of the economic reports different things that we talk about and and explain it a little bit deeper um or more basic more um\nLayman's terms ... so it's not so complicated what ... what do these things mean some of the things that we talk about what do they mean how do they affect the market why are we reporting on them why or certain economic reports\nUm important test cetera so we've Dylan every week now will come prepared with an item or a report that he will explain and go through more basic terms of what it means how it's used why it's important\nSo that is that we're having a tough time naming that because for people that are asking for more clarification\nThose are good questions we all have been there where we needed more clarification to understand why they were important we now understand them but we do this is our business so we should but for most people and and this is\nThis is why we enjoy this radio show and that's why we do our workshops and that's why we invite people in is if you have a question there's no question that stupid or dumb or ... you know but a lot of people feel that way I get a lot of questions that they start with and say\nYou know I Know this is a stupid question but and I tell everybody there is no such thing as a stupid question if you don't understand something ask\nUs ... will explain it so um\nThat's what we're going to do we're going to explain things you can call in and ask questions during that segment if there's a term or something out there that you want to know more about\nLet us know and we'll make sure that Dylan ah goes through that on the next on the next job we can show or that we talk about it while we're on the show so we need a name\nFrom doing something\nAnd you know how we like to use the alphabet so we typically keep letters the same so we're trying to think of something that goes with the de fer Dylan\nRight Dylan's diligent ideas\nWill come up with something will come up with something I write songs about the mortgage with a little round table right now\nWhat are you interested in her room and very but you know before we get into that I just wanted to say you come back

council education foundation and the ad council walk [noise]\n\nThan I was back in the money out of the show and it's that time first time for everything delivered\nAnd we've had a suggestion for this segment already lead that we had somebody on Facebook suggest Dylan's domain now I like that's a good it's a good start sell for this show we're going to do with that as until we get more good job my calls ... and ...\nOh and then I've got another one that just came in ... just ask segment stuff you just ask\nDylan ahead of time he'll make sure it's prepared for you said that a lot of participation on Facebook you can call us at age era five six seven eight or email us and I just now your suggestions thank you everybody out their art and Mike\nAnd and and ... mom sell All right here we go to Ellen Ellen domain and ... just ask\nStagnant yeah so this week in doing so and we're talking about the CPI in the ... index which just came out with updated numbers\nThe CPI went up ... percent and the ... point two percent this past week or this past month\nBut really what is the CPI like your staff for the consumer price index and it deals with inflation is the main inflation report for the future is in the financial markets I think indicates the cost of living for typical consumer in America\n[noise]\nIt does this by putting together a market basket of consumer goods and services used by people everyday such a transportation food housing and medical care and others\nUnexpected rises in this indicator ... usually leads the following bond prices rising interest rates and increase market volatility\nThe formula for the consumer price index equals\nTurf price of the market basket divided by the base prize the base your prize or the market basket ... hundred and the base priced base your prices usually in the Nineteen eighties and it's based on one hundred so if it goes higher I mean the period that we've got possible inflation if it goes lower possible deportation\nThe two main the factors of the CPI our prices at the consumer level or not us is supporting the men as they are to the ability of retailers to pass their own their own costs on to consumers\nThis is because people will begin barring disc out items if the retailers increase the prices of their premiums items to quickly from increased also cost\nIncreases and then the other key factor is increases in prices at the consumer level or result the ongoing increases at different levels of the question this increase in the consumer price index again this month suggests that there is a slight inflation which is expected of you\nThat actually one is the ... which stands for for the producer price index the producer price index deals with the price level at the producer level not to consider it as a measurement of the costs of raw materials to companies to do their goods such a steel farmers except for\nThese are the producers who produce everything like I said from Steve ... electronics to food the two things that the two things\nOr get as interested in with ... is how fast these prices are rising and whether the producers are passing along any price hikes due to consumers\nWith how fast the prices are rising if a ... and PBS except for good significantly large in comparison to previous on the market check the market checks to see whether where it's coming from an example of this is food and energy important expresses everyone\nAnd if for example corn because more expensive to produce than you paid more as a consumer you end up paying more than ... upper corner of the grocery store\nThis\nPoint two percent increase in PBR September that indicate the prices will immediately increased because of us that for the producer increases oppressed quickly people will be given by the discount it was\nThe second one is whether producers are passing on pass a law any price hikes through the consumers if inflation remains normal after the increasing producer price index that it can be indicated that the producers did not pass along their increased costs to produce their consumers to consumers\nAnd this was the only in the midst of this week and if you guys have any specific things you want me to explain all do the research during the week and get back to you next week and I'll do the job Dylan\nWe've got Dylan's dialogue we've got ... ... ... um hold on I Can't see all of them hold on just a second we've had so many responses that I Can't see them all the changes each week uh we almost could no deal and that was\nVery very good it's hard to take it there's so many pieces that go into inflation from the producer level to the consumer level\nAnd the fact that there are two separate reports in a week\nOne at the producer level and one at the consumer level and why why there are most people would assume if prices go up for producers they're automatically going to pass on and go to consumers and that's not the case\nThe producer has to put a lot of thought into whether or not to pass that on because again competition will kick in\nOr consumers will start going to discounted items and not pay that price so consumers hold a lot of power in what they're willing to pay and spend which is more the reason that producers have to put so much thought into into why did they change it doesn't\nDo up right away pushed the the the inventory they have they want to get rid of\nIt before it goes bad it's kind of a lag effect to the consumers if you CPI going up first the producers part consume is probably a month or two or three away maybe raising 'em but they don't like to raise them because then it it it it does exactly what ... said people then say well I'm going to go for the cheaper brand\nThey do tests do they said like a ... and stuff they would put it in the grocery store like little raised if the ... and then they would kind of see if people would buy it or not or if they would go and if they do end up on it than that no the cameras\nRight [noise] well it's good that was good you you you are you a very good to explain the difference between the consumer price index and the producer price index and what most people don't know that what the differences we hear the numbers\nLike oh it's inflation but they had no idea where it comes from how it comes from so we're going to keep doing this I think it's good to come out with some stuff in Dylan's domain that are just simply\nDon't ask don't we can't do my gash in but as we've got now I got another one that you your money one oh one segment the Dylan's dialogue I mean these things are coming in like [noise] like hot cakes\nAre now you're making me hungry I know what can you do a buffet will make some aren't good for you ... the writer that in fact the villain you did mention that\nThese number I mean these released come about once a month mhm right so um [noise]\nYou know and the other important we've been talking about the Federal Reserve raising rates they're looking at inflation they have a target inflation rate and so as these inflation rates and what showed this week is inflation is not out of control we don't have runaway inflation\nAnd so that kind of goes back to that goal they lock situation we've got a really strong fundamentally\nSorry to cut you off but we ... the heartbreak and we'll be back\nWhen the with money manage and Reuben with his letter of the week [noise]\n\n\nReasons will studio your local area where you will dot com and it's the use of a nice yard radio station [noise]\nCalls for a credible

information technology companies posted correction levels or worse on Wednesday according to facts at which is a division of eh shouldn't be\nNow what is a crash versus a correction I did get an email earlier this week about you know how do you know the difference between a barrel marketing the bull market\nMaybe this will help clarify that a little bit but it's important to note the distinction between a crash and a correction\nAs a rule a correction should not exceed twenty ... twenty percent loss in value in the market the term correction is for a period of time when an asset or asset clashed drop sober ten percent in value but doesn't exceed the twenty percent threshold\nBaron markets are usually when you have a twenty percent decline in that market or you know asset clashes\nSo that basically is is is when you have a bear market you've got to be down over twenty percent\nThat signals the Baron market if you're up over twenty percent from the lows that would signal that you're in a bowl and marketing we're still in a bowl and markets started what long time ago or two thousand nine I guess\nAnyway there are a lot of people that love\nSeeing the panic that takes place in the show off like this as you know over a couple of quote this week the several money managers assessed a number of names in the tech arena that we're overdue for a correction by the market in the shell off presented an attractive entry point\nFor some of these issues they love seeing the panic on the street because\nIt doesn't give them a chance to get back into maybe some of the stocks that they were not in the midst [noise] um so you know there are people that take advantage of these big shell option and um you know I guess we would all do that if we had a chance to ...\n\n\n\n\nI watch

we'll have to respond and defend our own interests\nChinese ambassador to the U.S slate tiny key on Fox News Sunday this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\nMy name is Joe Tom I'm twenty nine years old and

real information that's honest information and it just that's the way we ... you know when we're not just going to try to sell you something or give you a product you want to talk about what's going on in the world how it affects you\nAnd I mean I think that's a little [laughter] a little unusual for a lot of things is now everyone wants to have everything sold perfect in social straighten and everyone's so smart and talk above people you know just stuff\nWe've got to make it simple we got to show you how to do it we've got to help you do it and get through and that's one of the reasons you know I've been doing this show for almost thirty is not twenty eight twenty nine years and\nBeen in business here for a long time and keep growing it and getting good people in and\nAlways looking for good people so you don't want to get people's only give us a call will be glad to sit down and interview 'em and talk and see what they can do to help themselves and\nHow we can help them and how they can help us because it's got to go both ways when you agree that Ruben absolutely you know we've been doing this way too long to have people in the in the in our office that don't fit in\nYou know talking about uh keeping a simple that's really a good term to use you know we\nTalk about the diversification and the discipline but you don't have to it just doesn't have to be an elaborate scheme that you have when you put an investment plan together it right right I mean that it's become so complicated with all the derivatives out there\nI mean you name it there's a new product and they're all fancy names and everything I mean just returned back to basic fundamentals and and just you know keep it simple how many new\nProducts we ever using them I think gee WG bonds might be the most new thing but that that's\nBecause of last night it was a bomb badge because of lessons we've learned I'm the one the benefits the most is a person is putting the packaged together it was\nProbably the thing that I remember the most of my career is when they came out with the government bond funds yeah in the ... okay government bonds ones um and the explanation was these are secure the Judy ... is is that that the U.S treasuries\nNo risk they forgot to tell you that interest rate risk right I mean the interest rates started\nTo go and hire all my everyone's like what happened to my money was my money and it doesn't there's no maturity so would never came back\nTo what they expected it now obviously if you held onto it to now when interest rates went ... basically down to zero you would have gained everything back but they never told people that everyone short term and I remember not doing that because I didn't understand that risk part I said if I buy treasury for\nFive years at least I Know in five years I'm going to get my money back\nBy by this they how am I going to do it while you don't know why is everybody asking because they want to do with it too easy they can put their money into the fund or why would I Want to do that because it's easy now because you're going to make more money off it gives you bundling them together\nRight I'd go let's go to Thomas good morning time issue on the money to show\nMore than ... a great intro by the way um [noise] you got to talk a lot of a bomb on interest rates are going up they are\nOn a less a practicing this\nWell depends how you look at it the ones that your own ... are going to have less attractive missed because they go down but if you buy a new ones obviously you have a better interest rate today than you did\nA year ago okay so that leads me to my question and I and I hope you can relate to me so I can actually even understand it what what is on the lettering that a valuable thing to pursue now there's a market\nWhere I'm going to turn to solve the robot but I'm going to say it's the only way to buy bonds right now and but and then move is going to explain to you why because it takes away the risk of interest rates continually rising without you been able to do something about it so explain to what bottom lettering\nWhile a bond ladder basically is you're buying if you had a hundred thousand dollars for example and you want her to do a hundred or a a bottom ladder for ten years you would buy ten bonds ten thousand dollars worth in every year beginning next year year one year two years for a year for\nYou so you're not trying to I guess we're interest rates are going you're satisfied with the current interest rate market now let's just say rates go up over the next year you're first majority is going to mentor\nAnd you roll that out to your eleven or your ten next year so now if interest rates are higher you've ended up with a higher yield on that ten thousand dollar bond people\nThe five year ladders people the ten year ladders but I think whatever you do I I think it's a mistake in my opinion to put everything out into a into a thirty year piece of paper um I'd rather be a lender\nUm I I'd I'd rather I'd rather I'd rather be a bar or if someone is next explain why going out through the years right now is not a good idea well I always\nUse the the example of and I go back to Nineteen Seventy six I had a client come in wanted to buy a thirty year salt river a tax free bond hundred thousand dollars member what happened in the late seventies endless rates went up because the oil embargo and immigration\nThat that person paid a hundred thousand dollars for that bond by six years later if they wanted to sell it they would have gotten fifty cents\nOn the dollar fifty thousand bucks um if they held it they would have been fine right but\nAlready bought more they would have been better citizen tight you know obviously I always tell people you see double digit interest rates\nOh about twenty twenty five years I'm okay with that I mean even went to Fifteen to twenty percent but if you get ten percent on a on a municipal bond take it all day long\nYou know going back to that salt river they had to borrow money again in Nineteen eighty to\nGuess what they paid fourteen percent right I mean the state and federal tax free they paid six percent six years earlier which one would you rather um\nAnd that's why the bond prices went down by the understand that Thomas Oh yeah\nOh so am I the understanding that a ladder like room and said that he gave I mean we're talking about how lucky to get maybe two percent two and a half percent on something like that\nNo no the on a short on right now you might be able to get a little over two percent on a two or three year bond and then it's going to go up to a ... a highly three something on a five year bond and probably go a seven year bond in a tiny a bonding they go up I wouldn't go past ten years right now\nUm I probably would have been goal I think interest rates of our economy keeps doing well is going to continue to rise so I probably would only go out five years right now and then the ... and then as those would come and do that I Would go out longer", "show_name": "Money Matters with Dean Greenberg", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "14", "locations": [["Istanbul", 41.01384,
