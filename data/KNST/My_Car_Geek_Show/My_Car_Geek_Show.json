renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated\nAudiences around North America with a special segment on the French paradox\nYou remember the French paradox this is the counterintuitive concept that says\nRed wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued\nWell fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight or energy healthy aging and even longevity the holy grail of medical research and what did they find\nOut of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was was there a troll yes ... the active ingredient found in\nThat's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nNow our guest today says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce Robert Twenty years Dr precedent as the institutional New York radio hosting his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition you been a longtime product formulated and high level advisor for purity products that depressed mood welcome aboard\nMark always great speaking to ya\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's talk to them this was very drop a nominal those people out there who just to vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is ... spiritual and why is it all over the news today\nWell first of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News you know I read about twenty health journals a week and every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically\nResveratrol is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine it's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found in ... and the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when raspberry ritual was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms that even some fish well anything that extend the life of anything is going to the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six Italian scientist discovered that resveratrol extended the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and it even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand six and here's what really got them interested\nA Harvard researcher David Sinclair reporter that was very troubled counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon\nIt definitely supported normal and cinematic activity in the body it improved indoor and\nIt was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved indoor and storing aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function\nGreat study from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading at an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any receive health threat like not eating enough caloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt than coke dramatically changes as a major\nPositive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the tape according to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard no this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years of their co Q. formulas but now that feature co enzyme Q. ten which uses just as important as was there a troll especially for your heart health and you also say in some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs co Q. ten ... what exactly is a good four\nWell first of all let's take a quick take a walk\n... is a co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects well co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart\nYour liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxygen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's a while ago well I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point and that this is Nineteen sixty three\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin\nWhere they were looking for what makes the heartbeat they were literally looking at heart and saying what is making this darn thing beat well they found out that was co Q. ten and that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell wins\nHimself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of co Q. ten and your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten you're living in what we call an energy deficient state your heart and he's co Q. ten\nIn fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right in your heart muscle\nYour brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system it supplies energy to your lungs to your liver\nSo needless to say we need all of this energy that case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou've got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten in your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential\nI mean you could eat sardines and mackerel and peanuts we're co Q. ten comes from but it's not going to be enough just from your diet\nWell Dr person I just didn't you told purity that'd be quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two reads the co Q. ten and the ... you know why he's proud of is cutting edge combination purity calls it they're huge super boost formula what can actually do people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called the advantage I like that so I adopted the term it's combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which a spectacular but when you combine them indeed this spectacular this if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage", "year": "2018",

that you present purity products occasionally does these free bottle giveaways but this one sounds really special why is that is so important\nWell I mean you really get an opportunity you get a

from the vitamin D council\nAnd it's made me a believer but you added vitamin D and you've added vitamin B. twelve yeah now many people go through life not knowing that they've got a co Q. ten deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine well I mean that's a lot of people and we found out some pretty amazing things with all of this research now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin D day of bone on bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health and immune system activity quite dramatically in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that\nAnd a great new study out at the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and colon health I mean who\nThinks that those things right yeah that's amazing\nI think it's a welcome addition to this amazing formula the co Q. super boosts formula in addition to that I said to channel look we should put some B. twelve and here as well and it's called ... and I say that because the twelve converts the carbohydrates and proteins and fat that you're eating convert them into energy\nAnd this is all about energy and well being so when you're sitting down to eat your breakfast or your lunch or dinner\nIf you don't have enough to be twelve that great meal that you just said is not going to be converted into energy in your body\nNow I Know you say until you try this unique combination of the one hundred milligrams of co Q. ten the

Eighteen forty to one more time slowly for us to free bottles today write it down one eight hundred five hundred\nEighteen forty two now that I've seen these ads where they say that crew loyalists forty eight times stronger than fish oil is that true any sense\nWell you know obviously these are the guys talking right right right but you could look at it both ways let's get into krill in just a moment\nBut first let's have official guys on the shoulder because you know you could say that the fish oil is better and stronger but we're talking about the concentrated high omega three fish oil here because it's higher\nThan the omega threes the E. P. A. N. D. ha that are so important\nFor the heart the brain the memory mood your eyes you scan your hair your nails so in one sense you could say well the fish oils better but\nIn another sense I have to hand it to the crew guys because in terms of antioxidant power Crowell is extraordinary and it's because there is a molecule and krill oil it's naturally occurring called ... and the actors Athens Steve this is one of the most powerful\nAntioxidants we've ever discovered state by one measure of antioxidant activity at six thousand times stronger\nThan vitamin C ... amazing they had the opposite in power in the krill and now as we're getting older fifty clusters like myself I'm fifty two and\nWe don't make as many antioxidants naturally are antioxidants systems are kind of slowing down and at the same time we're producing more free radicals naturally this is why we call it cruel omega fifty plus extra antioxidant power and extra Crowell remember five hundred milligrams of crow instead of three hundred and sixty seven percent more plus\nThe vitamin D so important for us\nAnd this is just incredible value proposition I have folks they were going out and they were getting the krill separately the fish oil separately the antioxidants you could spend Seventy five bucks doing that and they'll get you're getting at all for free today this is the best of both worlds this combination product with the ... and the fish oil it's not one being better than the other\nThey're both great and this is the best of both worlds\nYou know thank God for purity products I'm Serious [laughter] seriously because when you think about where our food supply is gone and where we are today we have to have something that allows us to feel better as we age to age gracefully it's amazing to me it was ... and that's\nWhy I Love the way the purity gives way the free bottles was you know people can be skeptical said it'd be skeptical but now they can be skeptical and they say okay you know what this sounds pretty important I'm going to give this go it's only going to cost me six Ninety five\nAnd they get it and they try it out and what they start to see because it doesn't take long remember that joint study seven days twenty percent more comfortable but they start to seize hey I'm more comfortable I feel better they noticed their energy is better than they realize hey you know what\nThis

minutes but lots to cover today we'll get back to it here with Sherry Turkle she's an author and pharmacists\nAlways great to have you on the show such great information Sherry can you share with us a quick study or to to sort of backed us up highlight the science behind the elite asked his anthem that's found in as to FX 'cause I Know there were dozens and dozens of studies maybe you can pull out and highlight a couple of your favorites\nYeah for sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD at biomedical research or he explains that well he's talking here about how\nFree radicals compromise and undermine\nFunction and sell you the performance in the body he says after his Anthony's simply ... per at negating this as evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated recovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine and science\nAnd sports and exercise found that those who took four milligrams faster than the daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output and those who did not take it for the fights that you\nMay remember this after that and it's one of the few\nThat fireball antioxidants that can actually neutralized free radicals\nEven at the site of the mitochondrial membrane if like secular body armor protecting yourself your joints blood vessels brain heart and Oregon's on many levels so listen to this mark and there are four teen clinical studies on after than than for brain how\nSeven studies on skin health fourteen studies and I help including research for depth perception\nAnd focus fix steady\nGoing after than than supports cardio function\nForty two studies on healthy aging and cellular health and there's a ton of research on human performance to showing benefits for energy stamina endurance and the fact that facts it's incredibly powerful and versatile it helps you stand the game of life stay energized active alerts healthy and even stronger\nValues impressive on so many levels so much rain information there and I know there's last as Anthonette was about a dozen happens to\nBe here I see there's a patent for promoting I health\nAnd reducing I fatigue there's a pattern for inhibiting the expression of cytokines and sales end up having to get this on composition for body fat reduction there's one for improving muscle atrophy an older adult Sherry I'd like to be a little bit of a skeptic here how can this one simple nutrients\nMagically do all of this disaster ... give us so many benefits I mean really\nYeah I Know it's it sounds amazing too good to be true but it really is true many studies that I'm referencing here they're ... met these are reputable clinical studies conducted by leading researchers around the world that really back\nThat benefits the vast event than either way muscle output is better with asked event than to and this comes from after that the research published in the international journal sports\nNutrition November two thousand nine eleven this was another study done with cyclists they took four Nelly ... than than it was a small study\nBut very positive showing that cyclists improved\nTheir trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometer bike race I mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and the researchers said that they also burn fat more efficiently which makes sense\nBased on this research purity can actually make the claim that asked FX will promote and improve power output in your muscles I mean I tell people asked FX in his strength and power out\nIt it's transformative if you like energy and this was found in other studies to like one that looked at hand grip strength\nAlso much great information you're just tuning here we're talking with a pharmacist and author Sherry Turkle here I'm your host mark Larson on his hand ribs study the you mentioned I understand there this involved what a twelve milligram dose\nAnd they saw Ninety three percent boost in hands drank the people who struggled with tennis elbow now that's a big deal but our listeners might be saying well okay maybe I don't play tennis ... what about me what does it mean for me right\nRight so so think about this uh Ninety three percent increase in a person who has some repetitive stress in their album it's an almost doubling enhanced strength so just think about all the\nThings that you do in your daily life picking up groceries your kids your grandkids gripping the steering wheel of a car playing golf for tennis gardening or riding a bike a doubling of grip strength makes a big difference I mean when you take after than than you get stronger you feel stronger you get more energy and difference if you play sports\nYou play stronger so to me it's really quite extraordinary\nBut it's great information to not sure I Want to share a couple of more testimonials caught my attention out of so many right there on the purity website again these are unsolicited these are from real people here's one from Rick user male age fifty five sixty four lives in Naples, Florida he writes this\nWhat a great product to ask the FX has been for me after starting taking out the back of my work out and strengths has increased as if I were in my twenties again and I've only been on a ... for two months now can't wait to see the long term effect I look forward to taking as to affects every morning for my afternoon workouts I'll be taking this product for a long time\nHere's ... she's a female aged forty five fifty four she lives in Laurel park North Carolina she writes this quote\nI've been using asked the FX for a month now I can see the difference in my energy level\nI now have more energy feel better since taking this product I can actually see a difference in my skin as well\nI'm a smoker who has smoking lines around

Hara exhibits such usefulness and by the way they have a lady there\nIn her nineties without any aging spots in her skin perfect skin no wrinkles whatsoever\nPeople living in their eighties and nineties look a lot younger and it all became clear when we were there that they grow a lot of their own vegetables and foods right there near their homes and they have a lot of fresh foods and sometimes they have a little extra so they come down\nTo the vegetable market and bring their goods there to be sold\nSo we were there taking pictures and interviewing people when eighty three year old Mr ... she came driving in on his motorcycle to deliver his vegetables to the fruit markets pat\nWhere do we have in the United states eighty three year old\nDriving their motorcycle down to the vegetable market we don't have it we followed him to his home Oreos up on a thirty foot ladder trimming a tree he works in the fields about four to six hours a day and he introduced us to his neighbor who was Ninety years old without a wrinkle on his face neither of them use reading glasses\nAnd of course uh he works about six to eight hours out in the field every day this was remarkable I almost felt at I was in some sort of a place where the dinosaurs are still living or something that was so remarkable these people just exhibit\nA youthful this a a flexibility in their joints certainly a healthful mess that we just don't see everywhere else in fact it was so remarkable that the emperor of Japan actually has visited this village pictures were taken there you could see them all over the village there as they had posted him so\nThis had stood out and of course Connie Chung uh ABC News twenty twenty had gone to visit\nThere in the year two thousand this was originally on television you could see the actual pictures for yourself but the ha revolution has come here pat and of course we've had three years of use of ha but we could lose people in the science so they want to know what's real is this for real\nWell it's real for Tom's who writes to us a pharmacist now from Santa Cruz California Seventy years of age participating in the whole lie Iron Man contest in Kona, Hawaii\nThis past year Seventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joints did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no here's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty\nFive boy when I tried ha I'm now back to playing full court basketball but the twenty year old and I've even begun to jog again these are the kinds of reports that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the glucose I mean and there's another one that is pretty popular MSN how does this ha stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take them for a while before you even see any results do\nAnd most of these are very positive dietary supplements they certainly have\nLots of benefits glucose may take quite a while to kick in MSN is a wonderful sulfur compounds and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil ... these are all wonderful\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joint and if we can just replaced it if we can find a way to get that cushioning back\nThat's what we call usefulness that's what we had when we were young here's David right into me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help support his lower back and of course he said I Can't believe it now he says I Can't thank you enough for this product people have tried all the
