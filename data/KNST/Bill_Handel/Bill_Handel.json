that wrong that's why you use a straw [laughter] there are several varieties which one are you [noise]\nAgain if you missed in Santa Barbara I voted for the genius lawmakers in Santa Barbara said David he passed an ordinance said restaurant employees will be punished with up to six months in jail time or a thousand dollar fine if they get plastic straws to their customers\nBars restaurants other food service establishment ... um they'll still be allowed to hang up plastic stirs but only if customers request them\nOnly they request them\nAnd that's why I predict at some point here with a more every day it seems like a new Tucson restaurant is like are we going to see the ocean living in the desert yeah and\nIt has nothing to do with it again at ten rivers in Asia and Africa lead to up to Ninety five percent of all the plastic pollution in the oceans but they're going to make a difference at local scene in downtown Tucson and they ban stress so so so insane so interesting [noise] um\nThere's more of a need to get to that was that part of the way can you you got to put that one and by itself on the radio channel\nOkay I couldn't hear it when I was talking to the foot because then you'll enjoy when you listen to it again I already dot coms there's Guerra Lewis thank you oh You're welcome All right we've got we've got a place for them a thank you some Trump stuff or will do and we get back what the the comments that Trump made yesterday um\nWhat he said about trade with John Claude Juncker to you guys said 'cause again at our our lawmakers on both sides they all think Trump's an idiot\nAnd he has no idea what he's doing yet again Europe linked right they blinked\nAnd they said fine you got us we'll cut our terrorists\nIt's awesome what happened and it's like it's kind of being downplayed in a way by the media because it was the one simple as that will continue with this can't as the Ames have Ninety two sons most stimulating by the way this is this is hilarious before we continue with the uh the trade stuff right there's a story from the Associated Press\nYou know student loans right uh you know when I was on with that are that old hag at Fox News in the interview over the weekend she's an old I mean she's that guy Trump's just joined on student loan prize yang man Obama destroyed it by taking out of the private sector the government being in charge and if you have a pulse you get a loan right\nAt some point you take it alone or with their responsibility as yours so how how do price of college so it's more affordable well\nYou you don't give everybody alone and they call it the other colleges raised tuition like crazy because everybody was getting a loan and you're like it's not as long as you're getting money will raise the price you're going to pay anyway\nSo it's ridiculous it's too much and there are so many colleges that are just scams they have their way too bloated too many majors I make no sense if you're a women's studies major what are you going to do in life besides be annoying\n[noise] you can organize Regina marches what are you going to do go on Fox News yeah and and him and yellow over me yes that [laughter] so Betsy ... the education secretary here's this here's the headline ready for this\nAssociated Press Betsy ... proposes rules that would cut student loan or leave by an estimated Thirteen billion dollars\nYou're taking thirty billion away from students\nWait wait wait and how do they started students who are defrauded by their schools would have a harder time getting their federal loans are raised under new proposed rules by the Trump Administration Wednesday You're already the proposal aims to replace a set of Obama era rules that were never implemented\nDrew applause for from the for profit industry sharp criticism from advocacy groups and that represents student borrowers really what's going on\nYou ready for this under their proposal students would be eligible for a loan relief if they can prove their schools knowingly misled them with statements directions that directly lead them to take out loans order all the school\nSo that would be a higher bar they right so one you have to prove you been to ... you can't just say you are getting money back you have to prove it\nThe tire yeah that's good you got hit by a ... that's the you know some deep pockets there\nUh well I thought it was from entering his brain\nOkay then uh hopefully you have deep pockets so what is your question\nWell ah the ... the front of the damage the bus I think it was like three hundred and Seventy eight bucks and the ah the guy got along or I guess he's claiming\nOh yeah I mean that's crap just turn it over your insurance company just turn I did I did\nAnd then there are so there's nothing more to say you give them a statement you say that's bull a while you can't say that's bull 'cause you have no idea if he was in fact uh injured or not\nYou're not a doctor ah so what's your question\nUh well I mean I I've got the hunger\nDefined by yeah it's not going to go down to ... you know\nIt's not going to go for more than two thousand dollars\nWhat do you think he's going to get for a in a in a car accident in which a bus has three hundred and fifty dollars worth of injury or based on the based on a collision with a car oh please but we don't just certain over your insurance companies are going on for the guy nothing\nI wouldn't worry about it okay All right there you go a Alex Hi Alex [noise] whole middle yes\nI'm a truck driver California local driver and I just had a

didn't see a port a potty came back to them uh told them they look role you said there was a port a potty there is nothing can I usually go to the restroom now\nHe's like telling me now because you can't use the restroom so I told them you know it shouldn't be against the law for you to operate a business and conduct business and not have restroom so I don't know where I stand on\nI well first

you oh that's for for malpractice then you're in a different world entirely but I always say the same thing call contact a medical malpractice attorney to make sure that I Know what I'm Talking about

couple of years ago I found in the works because my wife she is she going to like ... gardening and I'm from ... to me for the ... and me\nThat is a horse and you know five out here on calls later yes go ahead\nAnyway I have a car loan um didn't begin in bankruptcy and if I call them if you think of the crowd away\nYou know now if you don't know if it's a car loan you probably don't have a enough equity in the car where it probably the car is worth less than the amount of money that's owed on how much money do still on the car\nOn how much\nYou're three thousand dollars on the car and how much is it worth\nAs maybe he will Fifteen hungry\nI Know you don't worry about it now you just keep on paying it no one's going to touch you can go bankrupt all you want\nOh okay I don't worry about it that that part\nIs and that's usually the case is I assets are deal I dealt with with the bankruptcy court so you file for bankruptcy and the court looks at how much money you old versus what you have and then if it's a liquidation splits up the assets but cars\nAre almost never ever put into a bankruptcy unless you've got a Bentley or a Rolls Royce\nA that is a paid out that's been paid for but other than that what you have users exemptions where you're allowed to have a personal car and usually whenever there was alone I as in his case you owe more money let's say you buy a car for twenty thousand dollars\nA day and so you you you go ahead and arrange a payment schedule you finance the car with a second you drive off a lot it's Fifteen thousand dollars is value and you still owe twenty and that's the case all the way down so no cars are pretty much\nA left out of it so I wouldn't worry too much about that I hello Mike or your answer her yeah oh yeah\nYeah yeah of course you're all

the first of all\nTime Mike Mike Mike I'm going to stop you right there because you're you're going way way beyond a what what they show is about\nUh you have a bankruptcy issue but just the sound of your dismissal issue you need a civil attorney to look at it because you may have a case of legal malpractice there was some statute issues obviously the judge had some issues uh with the statute asking you to file an amended complain it didn't happen on time there was a dismissal yeah you are definitely going to have to contact\nA civil attorney on that just go to the website of the story was

because I remember they wanted their their brief does does it you know talking about race relations and I'm thinking how can they be if they don't even realize the laws that are the crazy laws just past where they actually are themselves\nAnd who knows I don't go to Florida and I don't really have you know well what what was\nThe reaction when he told me might go to jail\nThey couldn't believe it or they they thought they thought I was joking wow\nSee this is why I say not everybody needs to vote you know it's okay to go live your life don't screw up don't screw up anything um that was the reaction we couldn't believe that that's that's the holy smokes\nUm well I'll tell you what man if you go round Santa Barbara today and somehow somebody gives you a straw or I'd love to find out if there's more reaction man I I ... I really appreciate listening one but two just sharing that story 'cause we're we're not able to be there\n[laughter] oh my pleasure as anything else crazy happens man please let me know Maker Faire from there to somebody else's disaster like exactly very good bribed them\nHey you're in jail [laughter] give me a fiber oh it's very much Jim bank you may be saved travel safely take great they thank you Bye bye how 'bout that\nWere everywhere\nWhere like we're like or not that I Would know anything about this but like\nWe're likely a link to her piece of radio where like we spread everywhere\n[laughter] is that wrong that's why he's a straw [laughter]\nThere you have a variety is which one are you [noise] again if you missed it Santa Barbara they voted off the genius lawmakers in Santa Barbara said David he passed an ordinance said restaurant employees will be punished with up to six months of jail time or a thousand dollar fine if they get plastic straws to their customers\nBars restaurants other food service establishment ... um they'll still be allowed to hang up plastic stirs but only if customers request them\nOnly they request them\nAnd that's why I predict at some point here with a more every day it seems like a new Tucson restaurant is like oh we're going to see the ocean living in the desert yeah and\nIt has nothing to do with it again ten rivers in Asia and Africa lead to up to Ninety five percent of all the plastic pollution in the oceans but they're going to make a difference it local scene in downtown Tucson and they ban stretches of so insane so interesting\n[noise] um there's more of a need to get to that was\nAnd by the way can you you got to put that one and by itself on the radio channel okay I couldn't hear it 'cause I was talking to the foot and then you'll enjoy when you listen to it again I already dot coms or Jerry Lewis thank you oh You're welcome All right we've got we've got to place them a thank you some Trump stuff\nOr will do we get back what the the comments that Trump made yesterday um what he said about trade with junk junk or to you guys said 'cause again at our our lawmakers on both sides they all think Trump's an idiot and he has no idea what he's doing yet again Europe linked right they blinked\nThey said fine you got us we'll cut our terrorists\nIt's awesome what happened and it's like you've kind of being downplayed in a way by the media because it was the one simple as that will continue with this ... of Ninety two sons most stimulating by the way this is this is hilarious before we continue with the uh the trade stuff right there's a story from the Associated Press\nYou know student loans right uh you know when I was on with that\nAre that old hag at Fox News in the interview over the weekend she's an old I mean she said God trumps just joined on student loan prize manning it Obama destroyed it by taking out of the private sector the government being in charge and if you have a pulse you get a loan right\nAt some point you take it alone or with their responsibility as yours so\nI had to lower the price of college so it's more affordable well you\nYou don't give everybody a loan and the college the college is raised tuition like crazy because everybody was getting a loan just as long as you're getting money will raise the price you're going to pay anyway\nSo it's ridiculous it's too much and there are so many colleges that are just scams they have their way too bloated too many majors I make no sense if you're a women's studies major what are you going to do in life besides be annoying\nYou can organize Regina marches what are you going to do go on Fox News yeah and and him and yellow over me yes\nThat [laughter] so Betsy ... the education secretary here's this here's the headline ready for this Associated Press Betsy\n... proposes rules that would cut student loan relief by an estimated Thirteen million dollars\nYou're taking thirty billion away from students wait\nWait wait but how do they started students who are defrauded by their schools would have a harder time getting their federal loans are raised under new proposed rules by the Trump Administration Wednesday\nYou're ready the proposal aims to replace a set of Obama era rules that were never implemented\nDrew applause for from the for profit industry sharp criticism from advocacy groups in that represent student borrowers really what's going on you ready for this under their proposal students would be eligible for a loan relief if they can prove their schools\nKnowingly misled them with statements are actions that directly lead them to take out loans order all the school so that would be a higher bar they right so one you have to prove you've been to ... you can't just say you are and get money back you have to prove it lifts so mean it says you're it'd\nBe a higher bar then the bar or a defense rules finalized under Obama twenty sixteen after the collapse of\nTo for profit schools ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges those rules allowed a relief in a wider range right have a breach of contract now it says here devoted ... says well students should be protected from fraud\nThey also have an obligation to do research before picking schools oh the ... this was just terrible right research [noise] the education department [noise] but in a statement said post secondary students are adults\nWho can be reasonably expected to make informed decisions if they have access to relevant and reliable data about program outcomes\nI mean that's why I said when are they one of the lawsuit is going to take place where the people that major in you know women's studies or\nWhatever these stupid majors aren't stuff like that they can't get a job are they going to sue universities they might as well rights but they chose to do this stuff like I don't feel bad if people graduate with a ... billion dollars in debt\nIn college and they have trouble paying it off because they choose things that don't pay a lot of money\nYou have to ask yourself is it worth it would have if I Want to be a social worker I'm not gonna make that much money would it be better for me to do two years in community college to save money and then two years at a regular college after that probably like you have the power to make the choice I still have I have one year\nNext July is when I finally pay off my student loans I chose to do that I\nChose to leave a profitable a profitable job as a bartender I was paying cash for college\nRight I chose to leave and go into radio and take out loans because I knew if I were to make it in radio I had to get in it early and work my way up I chose to die I took the chance it's on me so I mean if it didn't work\nOut it's still on me as it worked out\nSo people have I mean there were ... she said they're adults you're adults you have the chance it's up to you as simple as that\nSo she said they were adults they can actually they should be able to make reasonable choices I mean this is this is going to make the snowflakes melts you expect me as an adult to make an actual choice\nAnd on top of the world\nIs really your love

no problem there but was there was an accident somewhere in there\nYeah because I got America because of the accident\nOh you have to extend your rental car because of the accident that you that you had this being taken care of okay so All right now what\nSo my question is um the other part of my insurance is paying for up to thirty ... thirty there\nHi okay well then that's your insurance yeah the other party should be responsible for anything reasonable your damages or your damages and there is a and if the damages run that you'd eat forty five days for example the repair your car they just pay for that is what happened to me\nI'll get my car had to effectively be replaced and since it's a beamer three quarters of the parts had to come in from Germany on a ship\nAnd so it was almost two and a half months and do you know the other side just cough it up now I had to pay for and I put it on my credit card after thirty days\nAfter I don't want to do what I mean I don't think you have a choice I don't think you have a choice because the other side isn't going to send the check out until the repairs finished\nWhat my question is like what the white cat my inner part of the companies

the other insurance company that's paying you\nHas nothing to do with your insurance company not aware of what's happening is it's your insurance company is fronting the money and the other side is

a check or put it on your credit card but the good news is or the other side will pay for it if it's reasonable as I said two and a half months to repair my car\nUh yeah it took that long and then uh

a bunch of BS\nYou can't sell your interests to someone else is there I you have a lease correct yes you're right and it is there anything in the least that gives the owner of the property the right to deny new owners from coming in for example they have to well they have to okay you\nKnow then you're fine then this guy's crazy then if he went in and lock the door okay then I couldn't get out oh

out the minute he said no that moment that you know I don't think so\nUh so I mean there's going to be some argument as to uh you wave your rights you should have come in sooner so it's going to be

check let me tell you people normally do they use that deposit towards their last month's rent\nAnd even though technically uh the landlord can force you to pay the rent\nThe the problem is that he has to offset the seven hundred and fifty dollars that he has so it really becomes a wash and so just see what happens try or just call him and just tell a landlord can I use\nThe uh the deposit

my grandmother and my ... my grandmother\nNow think about it at home that they want to put me and my brother on at the ...\nWho was that what your parents and there are still alive yeah OK and it so I'm assuming it's a remarkable trust your normal everyday trust that they can change things around correct yeah\nWhile they're doing their they cover lawyers that my grandmother's home and a lawyer said that you know it you have if they ever have to go to the home that the government because they have so much money has come back she's getting paid for cooking on Medicare they're saying that the government can comment trying it money\nNo unless she is she had been is a Shia beneficiary of uh the ... of the narrowest\nVeterans with regards to my parents and something what's happened to my parents and they were going to go home\nOh I ... yeah and they're saying that they can do some type of paperwork that can stop that from happening\nI Would be there or if it would be an era vocal trust\nWhere you're [laughter]\nWhere are your parents no longer have any control at all to trust just shut up and then it's over that's done they just don't own it which means that they don't have assets for the government to grab but because they do go on I think not Medicare uh and I you know I don't know what the rules of Medicare but they're not going to let you go on the government Dole\nAnd pay for for example a home or to live for folks living with\nA million dollars and the bank that's just not going to happen now let's go ahead why if\nThey're not going to cut Fifteen thousand dollars\nTo what to change a judge to make a a a ... trust\nThat make it so that they didn't give me the name\nI Know that's great anybody's charge you Fifteen thousand dollars for that is

times they're not going to charge Fifteen thousand dollars and if they do I'm getting twelve thousand of that\nThat's why I'm looking out for my money\nGood for you good for you ... a little stiff basically taking a trust and making any irrevocably trust a that's not a very big deal at all\nAs the high asked me how you doing yeah yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nA coupon question for you\nKeep it short I am looking for the most and um I guess the new thing now is my cat after paying rent also monthly\nWaves are you where they want to wait your cats have to pay rent monthly\nCharge 'em you know there's a deposit\nOh yeah of course at yes I Know plus the thirty five a ... thirty five per cat forty five per dog car I'm not an okay\nUm my question is my cats are certified animals now I'm In I'm embarrassed they won't get into that but the animal um [noise] I can I waive the\nOther side of the question or work yeah well you're not going to be able to pull it off with two cats I promise you that\nEven if I got the paperwork\nI you know what if you have five cats and they're all service animals no no I probably could get away with one\nEye and I'm sure you're stuck and then I don't know if they can still charge you a for the cats are ... you know yeah that I don't know I don't know if I bought for you arguing the service animal business then are you um\nYou would have no chance they can charge whatever the hell they want pet fees you can charge extra so like the bottom line is that you for one service animal\nAnd it's now this is this an emotional service animal or is it a city and emotional support or is it a straight out service animal\nI Know no respect for an emotional\nIt's a low yeah because they are very few seeing eye cats don't be right [laughter] yeah yeah yeah they're not that now I understand right I Want someone when she asked me about a seeing eye chicken and it wasn't a wasn't the same I should probably not\nSo the quick answer is\nI have no idea if a money can be charged but if age I Can't it would be under those circumstances and therein lies where the rules are changing rather dramatically because there's a big difference we know train service animal in this emotional support crap\nYou know like they do on airlines peacocks and ferrets and whatever they'll cause you can call any animal as service\nAnimals and what are you going in

I Would ... okay so here's your choice here's my advice you're asking I Would get a lawyer that specializes in going after the church they know what all these lawyers incidentally which are the ones I've talked to were the ones I've heard of I actually do care\nAnd if it's a question of you need therapy more than you need money or you need both and negotiate with the church that's the way to go\nOut and my question is\nDo I get out 'cause obviously with the climate look\nAll these people coming our yeah me too yeah yeah well that's actually what would have prevented me from filing an earthquake but I didn't want to be involved in the bandwagon\nYou're on the bandwagon and she was an individual and do I need you\nKnow the lawyer ... known the lawyer that's\nWhy you want a

sir\nI'm trying to figure out how to get someone to live up to their their false advertising\n[laughter] yeah good luck alright I'll tell you what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that I bought from a dealership and it two years into the lead they sent me a written a letter and also email wanting to buy my car back\nAnd they said they'd give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought there or not and then when I went in front of them on it and they have praised the car and we out of the hundred temperature because the car was an excellent condition\nA ... we'll give you the deal will give you a hundred percent but you've got about what our cars but in their printed advertising and my emails especially especially that belief that this away rates that are paired up are you up to a hundred and ... percent of the current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value and you you got him on that All right there's no question that this is what they said ah they're out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is\nWhat is the value of the car or that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not about not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... by the ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car max and then I came to them and they were the original ... told me the car two years or\nWrite an are they not recognizing the car ... appraisal or they're just saying we don't care\nThat racial came higher than ... oh my God okay so so so they put they put it out to me and brought it up to me and then and then I said well what about the hundred ten percent and like I I don't know nothing about that they brought the manager out\nI gave him the document and email and he goes\nWell yeah we'll give you a hundred percent because your car I mean you're a cart was showing initially it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been particularly on at least that time and he goes will give you the deal but you need about when our cars and I and I go to ... highlighted another thing I go but it says you'll buy micro no matter what buyers are not ...\nWell ... and they they just stumbled on themselves\nAnd get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask this uh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars\nOr just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten per ... percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal and one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though they're much lying scum\nOkay I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought my Chrysler I bought one from across the street from a ... a dealership from them out of that and my truck I drive thirty five of them out here in my car sits in the garage so I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr a or you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I was just trying to get out of the week\nOkay uh and they offered that yeah they're going to buy your car back uh and and they're releasing it too\nI yeah\nYeah they are releasing it to you yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and now here's here's\nWhere I figured out the dad 'cause it's been a year and I've gone through\nBut right now I got it okay all I have a a you could sell the car or to anybody else at whenever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent okay\nWell the problem was with a hundred percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the league at that point I couldn't sell it for what the hundred and ten percent would have been\nWithout you know taking a bigger hit so I've kept the car and I just put it in on a leash so ah what I mean we only on the hook for just the love of payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been to like ... and they weren't going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right\nOh okay ah but you [noise] wow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer and that's the problem and what the damages are and how you figure out\nA God ... ah the difference is\nWe can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for uh the lease you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to and you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent I so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take it to small claims court\nI but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and ah the formula I didn't understand it worth it so ah that works out\nNow isn't it the ... when it comes to math beyond like fifty plus fifty\nOr\nA hundred divided by two I have a hard time see how that works\nTammy Hi Tammy\nYes good morning they'll yes ma'am\nMy question is I Am one of four owners or on a property and I had them paying the property taxes for

oh Edie Edie\nWhat's going on or what the answer what they're making more money bring your own back like everybody else sides that's it yeah yeah it's a now I'm Sorry it was supposed to be unfair\nI understand but I think they can charge anything above that now you could be that they only charge ten cents\nA and uh that's the way it goes I don't know what the law reads I mean you can look up the law that's easy I just look at the statute where they changed it and just read the damn thing you know just go on the Internet and go you know ten cents a bad law mandatory bag payment whatever a search word you want\nBut I based on if there isn't a law that says the stores can only charge ten cents\nAnd they must charge ten cents then\nAll they can do is charged sense but my guess is that there is a ten cent charge in the stores can charge way beyond that\nWow\nYeah so it could be the answer you bring your own Dan bear hug you when you went to the store and I always bring their own recycle bags\nRight right yeah\nOkay there's your answer or what a big legal issue on that one isn't there oh hey can I sue them yes yes I'll give you some lawyers a good lawyer six hundred bucks an

absolutely no king [noise] alright Regina are Regina welcome\nMy question is do you know of an attorney that would take my case on contingency basis um my father died I got sixty three hundred my brothers they should have been over a hundred thousand and they're telling me the only way I'm\nWhy did you only get sixty three hundred because\nShe took the other night I guess\nOkay so you have to sue the she was a a trustee was it a trust her was and will it\nWill that I have All right and ah she was a I guess the executor\nShe was not appointed she disappointed herself\nSo how did she get access to the money\nI guess he corrupted her with the code or you're the all right well I I don't know\nI had to pass on Christie okay that's the problem is that she's going to argue that was my dad wanted me to have the money otherwise you wouldn't have put my name in their eye and when the will ... will specifically talking about the bank account\n[noise] yeah I'm On the phone rang and I have it to you know whatever it let in there was supposed to go to me\nAll right but that was ever left there and they ... and it was specifically mentioning that bank account\n[noise] you know what I was told because you know again I I wasn't raised with them [noise] my brother's everything but my brother almost dies you couldn't be in charge\nYou know I think you're going to have a hard time I mean you can easily go to the website handle on law dot com and we have trust in a state lawyers but it's a it's not going to be easy you know how long ago did this happen Regina\nMy father young how long ago how many how many years ago did this happen to know he just died okay so the money how do you know the money's been taken\nBecause the bank told me that the account has been close she closed in February that is when I got\nAnd how do you know it was over a hundred thousand dollars now to kill\nMy brother shot before he almost died he was in a bus accident and so\nMy alright well you it's going to be tough getting someone to do it on a contingency but ah you your brother said he saw it and how did she see it\nWith my father wanted him to be in charge he took him around the\nWheel with will specifically says the money goes to you\nYeah All right well he tried ... I talked to an attorney or because there was an affair and now the trick is over a hundred thousand dollars to get taken a contingency that one is a problem because if the money's all gone in and she doesn't have any money or where do you go see where's where where's where's your pate\nYeah so there has to me and she spent the money a regime or what do you do\nYeah if I were trying to get the money and try to maybe helped make somebody that you go to trial and they can make make myself I'm ... ...\n... I don't know that's not so easy to do but it doesn't matter what can happen is all the accounts are frozen once you file your score to freeze the account but it's certainly worth talking to a truck truck in a state where I go to the website to do that because there was a lot of pieces on this one for sure\nSunny hello sunny\n... probably more in a crowded grad school to let the LA itself okay with that I Do I Do\nIn Georgia well I here's the problem you're probably going to need a warrior in Georgia and there are\nA the law schools generally do have clinics where they do we help people who don't have any money or it's these pro bono odd organizations ah we're a law students get to work under a lawyer\nAnd get some a practice but you're going to need die you're gonna find out in Georgia sunny\n... better and better that's out of the dark\nHair yeah became in Georgia you don't have to call a lawyer in Georgia recalled the law schools in Georgia and find out if they have any clinics\nOkay called another\nYeah coal every law school you can get your hands on in Georgia and then you may also want to just find out all organizations that do pro bono work\nSunny or are you are you bro are you broke that helps All right what kind of civil case do you have\nTo go out there my mom and uh this Lauren Frayer in ... when he was he was a a low cost\nYou know it's our daughter is a way that I gave them they uh they they're very ... and I asked him what to do with it and pay\nA fine ... wrote for the death for that but to divert\nOkay I Know this makes sense to you can you can get the death certificate and two seconds that's that's a public record yeah\nYou're going to need a you're probably going to need some kind of a clinic no lawyer is going to take this on contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars an hour\nSo called the law schools you want to look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia right\nOkay All right All right\nAll right good luck or just occurred to me that some law schools do have quite a ...\nAnd actually the lawyers and oversee those clinics are generally pretty good those lawyers are ah what they do is they get paid about twenty eight thousand dollars a year to oversee the clinics and uh they couldn't ah probably\nSo pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said in Germany at one or two calls and say come on bill really\nAnd I will say do you have any pencils for sale\n[laughter] All right Tom Europe welcome oh okay I'm gonna get right to it [laughter]\nOkay I worked for an employer\nAbout three years I left that implement about a year and a half ago and during the for years I worked for them I worked a considerable amount of overtime during last six months I worked in an average is eighty hours per\nWeek that's allied wire so if you left a year and a half ago Tom why are you calling now\nWe are because it's ... it has no force at all well first of all you have to say on me to keep it yeah first of all I can tell you I never said OK okay he's alive he's willing to throw you out if he's willing to say you have to this weekend to pop off and\nGet out of there than trust me he's going to lie about any verbal agreement any agreement you ever make its been writing he signs it\nOkay All right\nA verbal agreement you know the rules at this point verbal agreements mean zero and that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years to common law and common law incidentally\nThe law started not as human rights or contractual right at all it's a real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms of common law that is ancient English law which a lot of our laws derived from\nA it says that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years\nOr Stevie hello Stevie okay\nI get you know yeah if you're on a ... if you're honest uh what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] All right I'm okay this is the bottom line I I'm going to just continue my insurance or with Kaiser\nOkay and what I wanted to find out let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy is the federal government and the same way I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty on\nMe sure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't you uh there was a penalty why would you give up your health insurance typically Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that you'd be\nOkay so it's really ... the reason I'm going to do it is because\nI Kaiser so go to another so by BP oh uh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford it is out of his mind not the habit and second of all yes this at this point it is the law that you must either have an insurance plan or you pay a penalty questionable\nOkay that's simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea yeah I'm assuming it's now it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to a you know two thousand I have no idea if you can\nHave the penalty subsidize that would be hilarious that would be all areas or because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but do they subsidize a penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so so I'm right now though it's in legislation\nNo it's not in legislation there's nothing in legislation\nBut the Republicans are trying to appeal you\nKnow they're ... yeah but they have passed a law and there's not even been a law that you introduce right now\nUh so this could take this when we can take here\nI'm going to take years but a neighbor passed but get yourself insurance you know please\nHello Pam yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nOn a tight with apart had a partnership with the people that are for nine years we were down ... years ago\nWe had a recall it filed bankruptcy personal ... if you're paying for it so I Would label it file on it for us that my partner filed bankruptcy on her up for sale come back after\nA while it was kind of ... first of all was talking about the business was in a in a wealthy or corporation\nWith the get the park or a cat\nA and yes they can't come after you are as a one of the partners in since you've already filed for bankruptcy you can't you cannot go bankrupt on it has it been ah I think what seven years since you file for bankruptcy\nIt happened quite federal\nLearning well theoretically they could go but once that seven years is over you can re file I mean you're never going to have any credit again Pam that's a given but you can no re file and you can re file at any time\nSo it doesn't matter if they're showing you doesn't matter if they have a judgment it doesn't matter any ... anywhere in the process all the legal process or you can stop it cold once you file for personal bankruptcy it's over for anything that you would be responsible for what kind of business by the way we talk about him\nOn it was it was like I ... that went on that practical ...\nAnd why did he go under not another and then there weren't enough customers are wearing\nA robbery I got my check up or down after nine years\nYou're got robbed them neighborhood where are you in that was so crazy\nOr what parable Marino valley huh wow\nWhy it got really bad after nine years so we get that is set it down but I was going to be a critical that like my partner filed are there that that would have to take care of it\nNo because you have a partnership and go what happens is I you know I don't even if a partnership can file bankruptcy 'cause everybody's in your individually responsible for it right so effectively it's a it's the two of you know I don't even think it's a business it's a straight partnership where you're just personally liable\nWhy do why wouldn't you do an El Al see or a corporation\nOr low you know new idea where she said it you know I'm a Democrat so I didn't have to say although I'm going to repeat it Dorsey Hi Dorothy yes yes [noise]\nYeah for a long time ago me and my girlfriend and her mother we bought a house and we all fine and there's been a ... way past the stature imitation that ... that we're going to ...\nMy daughter during the day because we have recovered and she turned out you know go go down and make them when I went down to the courthouse money wouldn't even own a house so I was wondering uh any kind of way I could find out that I did sign on it oh\nWell okay it's a I don't quite understand that you sign on the house when you took a ownership of that house how did you get the house\nNow we are together throughout put money\nDown okay and then a Yahoo assuming than you are when I'm Alone\nI Know we didn't get along together we just put money\nOh so you're just by you bought your you outright just bought a house everybody putting an X number of dollars there was no mortgage on it right\nNow we didn't find it though but um I don't remember signing up for like maybe it was on dog they didn't really find that it's only for like maybe seven hundred dollar\nYou put seven hundred dollars down on the house yeah how do you own a house with seven hundred dollars down\nNo no no no no it is part of the down payment how much was the entire downpayment\nOh not that I don't remember what we find out Robert think we're all like twenty nine thousand doing it that was like five minutes\nA lot of fuss with courting disability and I'm expecting that large Thelma them throughout the report this to Social Security\n... you're on social ... are you going to be getting a large settlement a large

that's called an inheritance\nUh and uh I don't know the answer to that but thank you so much for calling\nOh All right I'm Steven hello Steven sir Yes sir\nI have a question about being arrested I I'm a robo called a couple of days ago that told me that I Am ... my name and then return alert all the money for our local law enforcement wouldn't be around them\nYeah I'm actually I'm of course not uh although I like returning those phone calls or they're just they're just they're just fun to return\nNow normally a yeah of course it's a scam and no they can't do it and they are in violation of the law and here is uh the problem you call the authorities and whoever a is a uh whoever handles that that it would probably be the FCC I guess who is in charge of that\nAnd why they put in a complaint and then they put you on the list because they've got two hundred and thirty million of those to deal with\nAnd I don't think I'm exaggerating either now I returned phone calls I got one the other day uh it wasn't even a a robocall it was well robo call in the sense of the dialing but I got a live person\nWho ah said ah ah I'm with the IRS and do we have a A N and we ... a ... and do you have to pay and nice and you have to pay right now and I went really\nUh yes and we'll take a will take a check over the phone or will certainly take a credit card and my favorite one is we'll take a I tunes card or apple cart that's my absolute favorite because you know the government takes apple cards apple to or I ...\n[laughter] anyway [laughter] excuse me [noise] so what I did is I said really a IRS leaning it was absolutely a go once you give me the number of lean\nBecause what he's talking about I said there's no such thing as an I arrest document that you're holding onto that doesn't have the final number on it so why don't you give me the final number oh we're not allowed to do that really and so I just had a ball with\nThis guy and of course hung up on him and I hate the fact that he called me the bottom line whenever anybody ever makes that kind of a a a threat you just hang up on him I mean it's going to replace\nWide I appreciate your\nTime okay All right yeah it's just what robocalls would I just read that fully half of the calls that you weren't going to get are now going to be robo calls that are now out there it's gotten to that crazy in my case it will be virtually all of the calls because no one ever calls\nI just I don't get people to call me because I don't call them and it's this whole thing about how I hate people that have me and so it's virtually a hundred percent and they're getting so good I got a call the other day and I were talking about robocalls I I mean it was I was stunned 'cause I I\nYou know if you you can easily tell what a robocall is if you even begin to look at it and think in your in your mind because normally or you think is is this going is this a robocall once you even asked that question you understand that it is so I got a call and it was one of those I knew my name\n... Mr handle and this is a call Mr handle and no one was on the other\nEnd except some computer Amish are handled my name is whatever for a collection agency and then I hear a ... as you go and the woman says oh excuse me I just dropped my head piece sorry about that ah oh here we go I have my hippies back on again\n[laughter] it was a robocall they got me they got\nMe I did not know for the next ten Fifteen seconds until I said hello hello and they now have programs where they go she was me I didn't hear you\nAnd then I started screaming you stupid rich and I'm ... by the way that was the least sibling I was calling a and of course they don't have a program to answer that uh but it was great fun robocalls but no the bottom line is if you ... the IRS never makes the phone call\nCollections agencies will and you simply say you stop it you do we do this by mail you're done talking to me they'll call you again and you've heard me say a million times use the magic word harassment\nAlso you can say I've been a which I Love is I'm recording this phone call I just want to let you know you staying on the phone call you stay on the phone with me you're allowing me to record the phone call click\nUnless it is a legitimate collection agency where they're following all the rules say absolutely no problem no problem you're recording\nYou all the money [noise] and okay\nAh this is a handle on the wall\nAre you putting your retirement savings in a four O. one K.

welcome to handle an ally Yes sir\nYes bill my wife went for a for better care uh\nThat's usually where they give pedicures you know is on your feet just wanted to tell you that OK okay\nOr any any way later that night her she got extreme pain into the big toe and or\nIn the morning she couldn't even walk so she couldn't go to work so we went to emergency and the ... part of her male off but it was in fact\nDo the pedicure [noise] so we gave her medication antibiotics Faye Faye off your feet for the next couple of days so she she got to know could go to work\nThe next day it didn't it didn't it got worse so we had to go back to the emergency pay the or the other co payments\nAnd then they cut another part of her mail and they said go through your doctors told them that they see in her doctor the doctor said I Can't do it our need to send you to pressure so she was off work before they couldn't see the specialist over following week\nAgain she missed like six seven days by the time we see in this particular it got worse they had to remove the whole now and she couldn't go to work again so\nShe ... ah two weeks of work because of the one creditor do we advocate\nWell yes you do the problem is certainly no lawyer in the world is going to pick it up and read a missing two weeks of work or because of bad pedicure and you have an infection and they ripped off a nail a I mean that's\nNothing there and so what you have is a small claims I don't even know I don't think that the uh small claims he's going to hear a small claims a a a matter of effectively a a medical issue negligence too where you were a ... where she was medically hurt you can try\nAnd saying here's what happened uh I've gotten the infection of course if I were the odd person on the other side of that or if I'm being sued and I run a nail salon a shop and he goes hey wasn't me that the infection someplace else\nSo I it's one of those than also what kind of insurance you think now people have\nA while the other thing that we thought of of going back to the salon and and telling them that we're considering to sue and ...\nMake any restitution okay that's fine you can do that\nAlthough I don't again I don't know how much money you're going to get so here you're damages the the work that was last what two weeks how much how much is your wife went make Henry uh she\nWorks part time so maybe I don't know maybe a thousand dollars in the last two weeks\nShe works part time and make five hundred bucks a week All right that's good what does she do\nShe works for a school district\nOkay fair enough so she's not a thousand bucks so there's that and then the whatever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try I can guarantee you that uh the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has a probably\nIt only has liability insurance for the building if someone falls down I Am breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have insurance so the other thing but yeah when I Would do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and when you want to do you want me to sue you\nAnd see what they say I'm assuming that the owner is Vietnamese right you know what a shocker a Vietnamese nail salon especially here in Southern California I\nShouldn't they carry insurance\n[laughter] yeah I Would think so although I don't even know what kind of mean ... what kind of liability insurance you have for nails\nI'm not sure but so what assuming I'm willing to bet they don't Henry okay so you're I think your ideas as good as any\nShow up there and say I'm going to sue you maybe we'll give it to you in trade you got two thousand dollars worth of a pedicures there's a lot of pedicures you know that a lot of pedicures",

not as long as you're getting money\nWill raise the price you're going to pay anyway so it's ridiculous it's too much and there are so many colleges that are just scams they have their way too bloated

you're really caught up in this opiate mess\nI Know I Know to certain animals ...\nYeah and it's a really tough I does a pharmacy have the right to say no or limit the number ah I don't know right now you haven't gone beyond your prescription correct I Know our fall on\nThem and I've been in compliance\nOkay so with that being said um have you\nTalked to the doctor who can make a phone call to the pharmacy and say\nLook what they call the doctors now and you know but yeah and the appeal limited ripples verified my uh in verifying the deal\nOr one form of the told me to come back from four hours I came back on for hours and then they told me they didn't have the appeal to very frustrating\nReally I'll bet well I mean if they run out of the pills they ran out of the pills I mean there's not much you can do about that uh they\nSay they might be being being a ethically should know\nThat could be I mean that could very well be a because you've and that's not the doctors problem that's the issue of the opiate or the or just the ... the hassle the debacle that's going through right now the epidemic the horrors of opiate abuse I and it's\nYou know you're gonna have to just simply start making phone calls around and say hey here's the issue if I have a prescription and my doctor verifies can I get mine I Need a prescription I've got chronic pain and I want I'm One of those people that really need it and I you know what you want to do is get a pharmacist\nWho is cooperative and it's a question of making the phone calls can you force the issue I don't know if anybody's going to take a a case like that for ... this year that this is not a reproductive rights issue when we're talking about a birth control which is a constitutional show no there's a big difference by the\nWay and I understand yeah I it because one is a constitutional issue your ability to get an opiate is not a constitutional issue so I it's a ... ...\n... ... when the doctors right that that's a long full ... mount bombing thing can do that they may do they have the right to the super the same\n... well I ... the pharmacy isn't superseding it they're simply saying hey here's the problem number one we don't have the pills number to our policy is we only fill seven at a time\nRight and I think they have a right to do that\nA song I think they would yeah I think they will either what my problem there that was my my answer I don't think we can work I don't think you can force and maybe you can for but it's\nA but it doesn't even matter whether you can or can't you've got a you've got an issue on your hands\nAt a a pat you have to I\nFigure out non legally and that is call around and say hey here's my issue\nIs this the pharmacy for me you want to talk to the pharmacist\nAnd just start going in your area and ... draws circle a circle that extend out and get any pharmacy in your area and big and moan and explain that you're that you're ... you're real or any one of those people that are falling through the cracks if I'm a pharmacist I'm going to certainly check to make sure that your legit\nI mean there's no question about that but yes that's a tough one\nAnd then there is an issue

[noise]\n\nOh\nMore phone calls this is a handle on the law alright Laura hello Laura Hi yeah I've\nBeen I was employed two and a half year than I had exceptional work ethic and perform and and my boss discriminated against me to my religion and political affiliation\nI how well first of all are your what is your religion\n[noise] Christian okay and I'm assuming you're not a wild ... liberal is that fair to say oh got it and you're not [laughter] yeah but I kept to myself okay so fanatic All right so a discrimination is a how or was it shown to you\n[noise] um she made a comment in front of a couple of others that have Christians\nOkay now ... that's all she did she say she hate Christian where you fired where you've demoted or were you held back from promotion or is it just she hates Christian\nShe lock man so I kind of transfer out I've heard of it and then a lemonade that my position [noise]\nWow yeah OK protected by her by her good friend\nAh who is no doubt a VP Muslim or a Jew or or [laughter] or somewhat of that ilk huh yeah here's here's the problem\nIs uh that I mean I'm ... on his face it looks like it is straight out discrimination show there doesn't seem to\nBe a a lot of a lot of doubt there but let me tell you which way the law goes on this even if you can prove discrimination and\nUh your boss can prove there was any other reason uh in addition to that that firing flies also eliminating the position completely gives them a lot of a just a tremendous amount of power for example I Know the company\nThat had a and it's a company that is in it's in the spotlight I mean it's that people know about this company and there was an issue a day and African American who was working there\nAnd I was and it was very obvious that this is the one African American that was their out of two or three people\nWhat they did is they just shut down the entire division and say I literally and said everybody everybody in the division is a shutdown we decided to shut down the division and boom where are you going to go with that or you shut down the division because you are a bunch of races I Know we\nShut down the division as a as a business decision you see that's the problem that uh you're up against\nMy performance was better than the three parents but together\nBut that's what you say\nAnd then I have proof that way and\nBut ... but even so as I say I division part is going to be a horrible also because your performance used to be wonderful doesn't mean that she's\nGoing to say that you are in subordinate I she doesn't judge said that and you it has changed I mean those are very very hard cases uh\nLaura how how's your Hebrew [laughter] horrible I see I work on that a lot truly [laughter]\nAll right Laura that yeah I mean it's it used to be where discrimination was\nIt was it was in a dead bang when or if you could prove discrimination the court has actually gone the other way in California which was a shocker to me when I heard about the court and because I and also firing someone you can fire someone for any reason\nLet's say you're employed and you're the best one in the division by far proof here is a you know what I Want to fire you today I'm your boss I just don't like any more boom you're gone\nWith no rights so uh it gets to be a problem to say the least alright Joe here you go Joel welcome Hey Joe\nHi I'm a Seventeen year old disabled\nBut I have some serious disability and I'm I'm having problems with my age oh\nWhat a shock whatever\nI Want to put a window in the bathroom in the bathtub after so I called the management company you buck Fifteen times they never called back where it got a chance to talk on the including trying to get a supervisor the board of directors are going to try to go to one of their meetings\nBut and they put out flyers saying when the meeting with the but they never put down the time\nSo I didn't know was eight o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock at night when it hit that put the window when ...\nOr ... they said the CDC in ours um rent we were having a window because of the zero why so but I went to the board meeting got very very nasty personal\nWith the way I may go back [laughter] um so that's where I Am\nYeah but it was but it has nothing to do with you the problem is you're probably you're probably going to need a lawyer\nOr to get you out of it it will be dismissed I mean there's no question you're you don't have liability here are based on what you said because you didn't know that you're innocent he just came out and do this you don't know what he paid for which credit card you have no idea now they fraud the company but it's a superior court action\nOr ... you know at this point uh I Would contact a lawyer\nOr that's representing the or the company that suing and and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with this\nNothing and lay it out and just say I I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant\n... it's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court dismissed and if the lawyer actually gives a damn and views you as an instant is an innocent party here and you truly are uh then there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent guy\nRight sometimes not but that's worth a shot just a\nLot of the founder no there's no there's nothing to counter to nothing to counter sue on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous lawsuit or he did work on your house the allegation if you were caught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation and may not be true\nBut it is an allegation it's not as if he just grab your neighbor and started suing your neighbor and there's no connection so but you do not counters too but at first I just asked to get out of the damn thing and then and then you probably have to see a lawyer especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well a lot quicker than I write in a ... the attorney but I also have to file every bond\nYes you do yes you do within thirty days you have to follow the response and you need some help that we're on\nAn avid attorney I could see that\nYou can do that yourself you write well actually I go to a paralegal and because you want to put some of that yeah you want to just there are some legal language that you have to know now you can go on the Internet and do your own research ah that talks about the fences and their affirmative defense is\nBut uh it's yeah you can do it yourself or with a little bit of research I absolutely\nLorraine Hi Lorraine welcome to handle on law I fail yes\nI took my car or in the habit that this is a pattern noise in my car and now I don't think my breaks for perfect when I took the car or don't drive a car I'm\nSure you have a I chase and and then you have to pay for\nAll right ah yeah\nFigure out first of all you want the money back for what you paid for and that's it that's all you're gonna get a weekend in fact I didn't fix a the noise ah you're still the same place with a noisy car and it could be the battering you're hearing aid is going south and you're hearing rattling noises and uh I have no idea how that works\nBrian Hi Brian welcome ...\nWanted to ask you for your whenever I've seen like down to he's trying to uh talked me into installing a bread on a a I have an open more that ah\nBeen chewing on pretend you're no no uh\nNo problem who have been trying to talk me into installing a bridge on their thing and it was a big three and a half weeks ago I allowed him to do it he turned thirty five hundred dollar and part of that preparation for bridge is you're going down\nTo write two teeth on uh yes I have one that I've\nBeen in a structured and calling for three and a half we thought it was settled down it didn't I've been on ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you know twenty four hours a day for almost a month now that we can end up on this\nYesterday and ah he says that I'm going to need to root canal that grounded proved them too much for the call is almost to the sort\nOf that's lovely okay so what's your question\nThough his response of uh my original Dennis responses\nIt's just one of those things that have\nNo no it does that first of all I don't even understand why a dentist would push for a bridge today when they're dental implants\nI mean all you have to do I have a bad do you put in a dental implant so you don't have to do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was put in the decades ago before implants were even around so I I have no choice but I mean the guy is from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a I have to go to another Dennis it'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens or you get to take 'em for malpractice problem is how much is dental malpractice worth\nA but now you start going and doing all kinds of research first step get another Dennis get a second opinion to say this is crazy this is not just one of those things that happened this is malpractice on its face and then you go from there and then you start talking to\nMedical malpractice people are in there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in pursuing my\nFingers right now than get it straightened out and send them a bill me going to show them anyway and if it's\nUnder ten thousand dollars a year go ahead and there's no problem and go to small claims court and other problems going\nTo be you'd have to bring a dentist in there you're gonna you're going to have to bring in a dentist a dental a dentist who is going to be a witness because he's going to say\nIn my professional opinion this is one of those things and it just went south and he's within the that is you are within that tiny little percentage that no matter what job I Do it's going to go south okay and and I\nLet her be the appropriate way being thought of it then\nYeah maybe or bring in lots of them are bringing in two or three and then see what the judge has to say\nOK okay alright traumatic yeah tennis is he spent all these years talking you into doing something\nWent in in ... when you when you get a dentist hockey when anything you go to a dentist when you need a dentist\nKnow you've probably heard by now or the new hack a Facebook actually Facebook\nHas had two acts within a couple of weeks of each other and it's kind of crazy how many tens of millions\nOf people have had their odd information exposed to these hackers
