[{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "The book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that [noise]\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that than ... than a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back to this one side of the audio ... what's ... how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made of that\nOf that book but she talks about time slips um and and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise] so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact so you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time has probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our descendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions to discuss if anyone wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and all of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of the questions that you as a professor religious studies back all the time\nYeah you're right you're right at least it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe it's\nDreaming could somehow lifted up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should their ... world right because we have three facial dimensions and one from Pearl dimension\nThe dreaming felt he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment and Don believe that um you know you're in a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher they lost their um that's what he believed to happen and some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as an additional visual dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he you know everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that everyone if they have kept a journal by their bed\nOf their dreams and he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nYou believe that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and how that I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences what to talk about science is a sharman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before\nFit into our

but after historically partisan confirmation by the justice is made on answer\nUSA today's Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolffe says cases challenging the timing methods funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happened to the portion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways that can be restrictions on the timing or the method or the funding\nThat cetera and then mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts\nUm strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they um um allow them but in more cases than not they strike them down based on what they understand to be Supreme Court precedent to those cases you know move along through the pipeline they take you know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they are likely to do\nAs much as they possibly can and these cases has fought them down and say we're not going to take him what whatever that lower court case decision was at the federal circuit court federal appeals court we're going to let that stand [noise] so that's going to apply which one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nArts so the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but it points you can say now it seems like a good time\nAnd it's like well yeah another which the court gets um what's the number the court gets like eight thousand or ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about one percent of those and\nIt says it takes her either important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where circuit courts should the federal appeals court so the lover right below the Supreme Court\nAnd they they're sort of reaching all there are regional circuit courts and those are often split I'm two or three circuit courts may have ruled one way on an issue\nAnd one or two or three circuit courts have ruled another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this show a lot of these cases come into court on abortion now not reflect those kinds of circuit split the court can easily say\nI'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now and these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they are directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court could simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled stands people that just wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides and the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court\nAnd might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year simply doesn't want to do anything that might be seen as partisan\n... we're speaking with USA Today Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can say uh we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well please\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another\nLet's say because it's often the case that anti abortion plaintiffs those bringing the case\nOr want to go to the Supreme Court and say hey he you know we want to ... a a a twenty week limit on abortions or we want to outlaw a certain type of abortion and the second trimester or we want to outlaw\nAbortions that are undertaken touch a particular reasons like the ... or the disability if the fetus the court the Supreme Court only gets involved that says All right we're going to hear that case not because it's interesting\nBecause it basically has two because lower courts are ... of course ledge because legislatures in court you don't know what to do because there's a conflict between appeals courts and\nThat doesn't happen very often I mean the last major abortion case that the court took a on the subject of the actual medical abortion as opposed to things having to do with like you know harassing\nPeople outside clinics or something like that was back in two thousand and chef and it had to do with partial birth abortion and then in two thousand and six team just a couple of years ago it had to do with a Texas law that was restricting clinics restricting providers\nThanks rich USA today's Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolffe twenty minutes now in front of the hour\nOn this

on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nAnd there was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived\nThe men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and ... attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on their back you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them\nThere's one account you have the sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking don't use drugs thinking oh there's food I'll just reached out and grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and some by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off and thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then if you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah the everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before and then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a\nSixteen rats between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any water that was available with only available on the grass and so there were only about forty\nMen among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in in the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others would you take small heard is that the sea water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gold thing it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels for\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree

generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight and they see this\nKind of explosion coming from Milo and\nThere's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action do you think well maybe this is true or something of that nature but yeah I get the same kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times and yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw the genuine look into it and they said no there is nothing report in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they\nHad a son who you know the gentleman richer the friends that have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and we're at the ...

resale to questionable repair shops or unsuspecting online customers law enforcement authorities in several major major markets have noticed a flurry of reasons ups\nMore from USA Today business reporter Nathan booming who's been researching this made them what's going on\nYeah this is really interesting story I I was surprised to see that Honda's our susceptible to Arabic that this is a crime that has existed for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with late model Honda vehicles specifically the accord and civic although\nSome of the hundreds as well are being targeted by the two are realizing that these airbags can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases they break into the vehicle they they basically tear out of the steering wheel and then they fill in the black market\nAnd ... with what just anybody who happens to be in an accident and blow the euro beggars is tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens when you need to get your bag replaced you have a couple of different options course most people are going to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop either place there are\nSome people ever gonna get it done this either going to have a friend or they'll go to maybe more disreputable type of repair shop and that's where\nA lot of these type airbags end up being sold if you actually go on ... for example and you search for this you will see their airbags being sold on line so it's it's definitely happening\nAnd it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealerships suddenly you're not going to end up accidently buying a user airbag or something but there is a market for these things\nShe saw it and the reason that it's Honda's because they're popular vehicles and just happen to be more of them perhaps\nOn in ...\nWell I definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that Honda's long targeted for theft but that's in part because of the fact they're popular but we don't make much sense to me is white only ... because in talking to the police and various markets um\nYou know almost every incentive looked at it was exclusively on this show you know the you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with the actual specific\nArabic conductors or some being exactly what it is\nProbably the thief themselves are the only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nSo it ... the ... what uses a night ... kinda strips away the ... covering of the center part of the steering wheel and just pulled it out I was at work\nThey somehow gain access to the ethical and then they basically a use a knife and then they rip it out and it only takes a few minutes I I went to some incidents where you know they hit dozens of vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night\nSo you know it's it's definitely I'm\nNot a difficult thing to think about this is like you know\nAs a laptop out for the seat in the car I mean if the left towards thousand dollars' worth so there was a big incentive for the ... and you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the other one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up so the incentive is also gotten up well\nWe'll speak with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece in federal

from the Democratic base to begin investigations of various um activities in Trump world including potentially\nA re revisiting the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh but also having a look at some

forty we're sticking around\nI think it would be I mean I think it's a big deal a you know some of it it's actually more than forty depending on how you count so it's a big number and you know I saw some of those are the Republican incumbents were going to be in trouble in this environment anyway so they you know got out while the getting was good\nSome of them probably could have better defended their seats than a newcomer can answer that opens the door or the wider for Democrats is actually I think one of the unappreciated factors in in this campaign is the amount of open space Republican\nRetirements left for Democrats to move in and one of the interesting things that's happened in one of the reasons Democrats feel good about house races is that these democratic challengers in swing districts where there is an open seat or Republican U.S left\nOr by and large well funded this time they've managed to raise a lot of money um there's a very active democratic financial support network now a lot of small donors a lot of it's on line\nAnd so you have not only democratic challengers who are facing an open seat that they have a chance to win in a swing district as well

reason Americans are cutting back each month is there need to save more money but for what purpose analysis from Greg McBride sheep on angel enlisted at bank great right what are some findings\nAbout two thirds of Americans are limiting their spending are\nBuried reasons but the fact that two thirds are holding back in it what is otherwise a pretty good economy notable this is the highest it's been four years um you know in the middle of the range that we've seen over the years but it's a reverse the trend where you see where\nThe economy got better and better\nUh each successive here we saw that people are a little bit looser with the purse strings and that changed the share it jumped from sixty percent now to sixty six percent that say that they are actively limiting how much they spend every month reversing that downward trend that we had seen a in several years prior to that\nYou referenced it in a couple of your remarks there but this is a solid economy right to wages are creeping up the tax cut pour more money in Americans paychecks why this trend now\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned the growth in household income and I did that is one thing that we have seen consistently show up of the last few years that was initially a well we started looking at this oh five or five years or so ago\nThat was the topic of the people limited they're spending it was like as their incomes weren't going up what we noticed over the past several years though is that as a income growth became more broad based that became\nLess and less the case where that was the reason people holding back and instead people were saying well I'm holding back in order to save more money that continues to be the predominant reason and buy a pretty wide margin a couple of other things that that they're watching the percentage of Americans that point too\nToo much debt as to why they're holding back\nThat's been creeping higher each of the past few years down the highest that it's been at any any point that we've looked at this over the last five years and I think that's consistent with a rising interest rate environment that better economy we are seeing debt burdens come up but that the higher debt burdens\nCoupled with rising interest rates are they get shows that there are some people out there are starting to feel the squeeze on interest rates and then we even an assault economy there there there are still those that are\nYou know those ever present worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people that say that the reason they're holding back us there's the you know worried about the economy began not a whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year a lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows that he'll even on a sunny day nobody's worried about right\nNow and we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending about my generation what's that break down\nAnd you know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending and inclination to save more as the reason for rolling back\nSkew younger so I wasn't particularly the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend and they're also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on on my spending Gen x is not far behind um but it's so similar trend there\nAre most inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to save more money\nBut that's where it changes the baby boomers those are the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back\nOn their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter] but when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth in on the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that you know particularly for baby boomers that are in the workforce stagnant income is still very much an issue\nThat much of this is the recession hang over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it to say\n... what the Generation Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking up on their own\nSo certainly with millennials I we've seen this this is no fluke I mean we've seen this\nIn a number of different surveys that we've done over the years you know some of the things that you and I talked about in the past ... millennials have a greater inclination toward saving they have a less of a consumption focus and they're more averse to debt than what we have seen from\nPreceding generations and I think a lot of it stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand in the case of older millennials or seen the impact that it had on family members\nFriends older siblings I'm just as you were sort of in those financially formative years has undoubtedly had in the fact that we see that\nManifesting itself in a number of different ways you know in this case it's that that focus on saving limiting the spending in order to save more money\nLike Greg Greg McBride chief financial analyst at ... dot com twenty minutes in front of
