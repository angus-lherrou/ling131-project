a great weekend become everything's call me back in\nOn Monday rubbed in reading and\nI dumped is only we can be doing as only weekend [noise] and then of course who is this week talking what am I saying [noise]\nMy name is Joe Thompson I'm twenty nine years old and they have a career that I Love is a systems analyst career it still sounds cool to say that word I never could have gotten on this path without a college degree\nTo college and they were here he tell you I never would have gotten to college without big brothers big sisters\nI could have ended up anywhere on the streets even\nCollege Joe Thompson not likely [noise] my big brother helped me out\nShe taught me I could do anything\nAt a time when a lot of people were saying just the opposite\nSeven year old\nOf big brother's name is Phyllis reading that seven year old girls as analysts [noise]\nWhether you donate money your time you're helping big brothers big sisters hope a child\nAnd that can last a lifetime [noise] start something to the big brothers big sisters who died or\nBrought to you by big brothers big sisters in the Gulf\nRegion will studio your local region will dot com and it's being used them and I ordered radio station\nHow serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers\nAnd if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months that I like to know where are the people he communicated with was he\nA friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying\nAnd and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great friend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history Deb Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka\nHas become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions is I have\nAnd so this guy who ah hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo one headline Saturday yesterday and the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post\nThat are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama\nI Want to know the media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor\nSee Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses fascination of Republican members of Congress resulting in a motor wounds to Stephen skill lease\nThe Washington Post the next day\nRan a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the Capitol tape the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the uh the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder for many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor brick Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they've got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nAnd so I'm On the right committing acts of violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion it's Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam on big at the anti Semite set a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and cheered coding juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight not to allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago and\nThat that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgust me\nI Hope soon very soon but a powers is killed either a by lethal injection heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way Timothy McVeigh for violence and Bowers\nWas a Trump hater but the Washington Post has some al implicitly tied Trump to the murder of God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh the whole thing is disgusting\nWhen you get your reaction plus we're going to have later on David Wray affair to talk about what's happening on the southern border\nIs anyone thought about the public health crisis caused by thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding into the southern border with type ... measles whooping cough\nThey you know the Ku Klux Klan and the Democrats lynching Democrats they're all Democrats so please can the media set the record straight when the president said there's good people on both sides the one thought he was referring to\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments\nOn the other side where those protesting it was not referring to the white nationalist caring tiki torches shouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there's no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman shouting racial or Jewish lawyers\nAnd the southern city at night carrying torches\nThere's no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's wrong\nLet's continue we'll get your goals were causing Wisconsin Ohio Indiana Illinois Nevada Florida New York and California by the way the\nBoston Red Sox are bought 'em in the seventh inning of four to one [noise]\nBecause Andrew ... a friend of mine who plays left field\nFor the red Sox I'm rooting for the red Sox\nThose continuous more still counting hand the great American your calls her next live with you\n\n\nLikes to play you go again by around ... wait I didn't mean by that I just wanted to know what I mean it's all about you I agree with him that\nKim and share like barking around feeling sorry\nMaybe people generally prefer the swimming and comforting kind of a female voice apology\nAccepted her Kate Brown so what station did you want to hear against\nGay and that's the I Am seven Ninety there was nothing artificial about their talent\n...\nThis week\nA rock and roll lovers is any west let's take a trip back to this week in rock 'n' roll history\nAs we can Nineteen Seventy five Paul Simon issue is for solo album still crazy after all these years gone it lasted sticky ways to leave your lover and the title track all reached the U. S. forty and the album hit number one\nSimon's first album to do so emancipated from Simon and Garfunkel fans finally\nStop shouting where's the party at his shows\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy six Chicago started a two week running number one\nOn the U.S singles charged with if you leave me now it was the group Eighteenth south forty hitter but its first number one they went on to win the Grammy Award for best possible performing this week in Nineteen eighty seven Michael Jackson started a two week run it number one on the U.S singles chart with bad\nMusic video for bad directed by Martin Scorsese and co starring one of the first appearance is undiscovered Wesley Snipes was released later in Ninety seven\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety three time magazine put any better on the cover with the headline all the rage book veteran Kurt Cobain refused to speak with a magazine for the story but they ran it anyway in an attempt to explain why young people are listening to such angry music and this week in two thousand\nThree in the middle of their first world tour and flush with fame from their debut album ever in essence founder Ben Moody abruptly quit the band\n\nAre you better off today than you or two years ago [noise]\nDoes America are better off today than it was two years ago as a Foreign Relations better off today than it was two years ago\nIs the judiciary better off today than it was two years ago in fact what's going wrong is the unemployment rate better now than it was two years ago or more people working today than two years ago is the American military stronger today than it was two years ago\nIn fact everything it could go writes gone right and not much has gone wrong and that that's gone wrong largely has not been Trump's doing but other forces and he's the president but he's not the ... he's not the dictator is not the czar\nContinue their calls will go right to go to Robert know Utah Robin Utah welcome to the bill Cunningham show Rob go ahead\nThanks for taking my call Yes sir thank you\nWell yeah in the middle of the shooting at Al Sharpton on\nMSNBC and and I am now and then\nAgain and and friends [noise] you know\nWell I'm ... how about the riot that Al Sharpton started a New York city are based upon the death of a Jewish person what about British furniture Mart\nMean it Al Sharpton life is filled with anti Semitism any run around with Louis Farrakhan who called ...\nAnd I I watched it and going\nOh you're right you're not able\nTo address I just Google this December thirteenth Ninety Ninety five the river and Al Sharpton apparently referred to the Jewish shown or a ... fashion\nBut as a white interlopers in a rally three months before the Harlem massacre newly revealed tapes show Sharpton is not named Freddy but mentions the least dispute and calls out his audience Nineteen years ago Al Sharpton is cited the massacre at Fridays furniture Mart because a Jewish a small business owner moved into the black community\nAnd so I I just Google it and how how does he get away with it\nThat's what I'm saying I got away with it that Middle East is going on and on it it's the people for this crap\nAnd you know other than that that guy who is that right to the White House and it was All right and he actually got the cash for being made rice and\nMrs you're calling from Utah and this is the guy who's now under an indictment now this one's in a large media stories that fair to say in other words maybe\nDidn't have an immediate story hair in it\nAnd second hand the phone\nAnd and and all the white powder sent to the Trump children not much of the story at All right now I don't know just being concoction would've actually cause any damage but it was like a fake pipe bomb in other words it was intended to cause fear\nAnd if someone would get that and you open an envelope and you get a white powder all over your hands impose on your lap believe me and say fearful tear filled event and this was a regular event that the left does to Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nCover it and you can make rice and I don't care if they're being and and there's a real\n... well can you imagine if a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] oh no you couldn't even bring up you're going to bring up anything you can say a word\nWell Time Warner did this to Trump well what if the parent company of Fox\nAre sponsored a play in Central Park that depicted the murder through repeated stabbing of Iraq Hussein Obama look alike saying twenty ten what would the me I'm number number one Fox's parent company never do it but Time Warner\nSponsored a play in Central Park Shakespeare is Julius Caesar with a character looking like Trump being chopped the death toll on stage and the and the media loved it and the audience cheered every night now what did the same thing happened to Obama sponsored by Fox\nFavorite comedian who pay rock Obama and held his head bloody head on stage\nOh Cathy Griffin now is touring the country to slow down audience as\nWell I explained to me Rob why the media doesn't respond to these obvious\nDiscrepancies and disparities between the way they treat different acts the same actors committed it kinda depends against him was conducted thank you for your call let's continue we have ray in South Carolina ran South Carolina welcome to the bill Cunningham show right go ahead\nYou're great American bank you thank you yeah I can tell you the reader you got people that got you

coming up\n[noise] K n S T\nSaw from the region will studio your local fishy area freezing well dot com and that's the hard radio station [noise]\nMigrants back on track moving north I'm an Carrick Fox News Central American migrants streamed through southern Mexico heading toward the United states after making an end run around Mexican agents who briefly brought blocked them at the Guatemalan border Fox's William last year that\nAnd so right now a regular army of ... migrants streaming through southern Mexico\nToward America has made an Enron this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand and every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them\nThey talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do and the F. word all these things are shattered against our president they're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor aboard to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals\nFrom the most violent place on Mother Earth\nMake their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically\nThe media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice South American Central Americans and Mexicans something like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million\nWhat would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore two hundred million want to come here and because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico to him the other words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic car that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled\nTo have enough camps they have enough judicial officers to have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who adopted her jet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats as extremely serious\nIf you're from Mexico here illegally you mean taken right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to hearing that goes on and on and on and never stops so uh I I'm interested to see when and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there's no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California taxes to New Mexico through legal migration that there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist\nRemember that nine\nOf the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here and mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI said in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration federal judges and the economy right now with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable Trump has everyone from North Korea to Russia\nBelieving we're about to bust up every new trading necessary to keep to get America back on even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran has on notice in marginalized\nEven the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise\nThis guy is performing magnificently but the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individual is here with a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them according regarding party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan to vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live I'm Sorry\nAnd I wish there was some way through the magic wand\nThat we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have\nWe're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through ... says these we've taken legally one point one million foreigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here and watch hordes\nOf young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five to ten years from now that will never happen\nThis is fundamentally changed our country that is far\nAnd it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nThat out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people or the school was coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go ... or the bridges and roads next\nThere's always ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible that the most violent places on earth is sending its largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great no there's no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this was not benefit\nThem at all there is a benefit American business does it benefit American public education doesn't benefit the hospital systems that we have\nThis benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that we\nAre a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join a country come and walk into a country which you don't belong to and not a citizen up men demand right\nAre you kidding me\nOh last year the question tonight is that the issue that's going to cause millions of Americans in two weeks and two days to vote for Democrats do you believe that\nOne eight six six six or seven seven three three seven we continue we have calls from a Chicago Los Vegas Connecticut California San Diego and every place in between coming up later will be

to be down at the border in a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand I Hope you're not by the time spring\nThan Trump has already said he's not used in the reserves and he's a real army and I think the plant is they want to get like another ... ... ... American troops from the border\nThe immigrants are being oh don't\nWorry torment like stormed the Mexican border or your days ago mecca would put in a token effort to hold them twenty four hours or the U.S and Mexico because Trump has got a very good Mexico archer right all these people on our border\nThe troops are going to be there they got to be told stormed the truth\nI think there's got to be a lot of gunfire a lot of Democrats are going to be there they're\nOh it's ... years maybe we're to coordinate\nOffend them and that's where you're from a Dick Blumenthal he used a war hero\nA state of Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty I does this play well with residents are Connecticut because when I watch CNN or ABC News I'm thinking they're thinking this was playing horribly for Trump\nWhere I live in Ohio we don't want ... will\nHappily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizen to take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals come and go most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people\nIn the state because of the high taxes I think the typical person in Connecticut has been a legal immigrant there's tens of thousands of them here thanks to Governor Malloy ... into the past year and a half the Blumenthal every time these legal immigrants ISIS above the court room they hold up her shirt\nBlumenthal shows up a picture for other Congress

earth Central American we're not scaled to doing\nContinuing ed and know Los Vegas Nevada and ... and welcome to the bill Cunningham show ed please go ahead\nYes first of all the FBI and the U.S national security establishment should investigate and find out who's funding the current a con boys or that or whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should\nFind out who's doing it also how can Obama drone American citizens like this hour we eat guy kill them all up you know trial no jury electrocution and then the media doesn't saying you know about that they really do much later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and it's because you know you could shoot him in in the view of\nCNN 'cause she'll get can be used as a club or against Trump they'll do it\nBut ... out of whack he's being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by not a legal immigrant or not was quickly dropped she's gone a composite or killed on a regular basis no big deal and in fact that ... that kind of behavior in that part of the world\nIs regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much\nBut I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia I mean when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalist and then I hear about ... show again is if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what the un is get do and why why is his life more valuable than a ...\nNPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayers is the same I end up look at the head of the past ... who's back to the ... the oil as political opponents folk\nAnd Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we needed the base there to supply Afghanistan\nPlus ... says African Business conference that Obama held\nFor fifty African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ...\nGallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and and the are they just fall over how the great Obama was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights background of this stuff\nWorks for us for getting leaders so the whole thing is sick\nOr not and and you went over that quickly but use backers than had any leader\nWho would boil alive his political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary

these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate\nSome of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics we're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him\nBut I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nYoung student who had been on the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and they would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the\nStrength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium\nHe would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer would take a picture and and the you know the fake media would be totally surprised they were you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and\nSo these guys are very sick\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of ah yeah this writing on beating on Harry right into my\nThat's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else um it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was ... I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet a Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that\nHow did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spirit you list and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fan just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise]\nYou're driving and protecting America\n[noise] down here in rock spotlight from Nineteen Seventy six Dylan releases down desire to go one is mainly just significant radio airplay for the single hurry\n\n\n\nJohn\nStations obesity rule was finally glory and the U.S with a number one single Saturday Night\nMiliband member by gang members you know green\nRibbon is number one was live out in ...\nI'm from the ... out\nHard rock Star Wars among them which\n\nFrom some of these [noise]\nYou deserve a better way to watch the ESPN was live for and all of this show roaming\nWith the original and these fires are and\nBoom\n\nOn my body\n\n\nThe moon networks resume goes to goes to the you know use your guest host Richard ...\nSay hello on Twitter at Richard Sayre and asked why because I Love you R.
