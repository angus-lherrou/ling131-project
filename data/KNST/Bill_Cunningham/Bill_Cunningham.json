my friend that you\nGo let me share with the American people something you've uh put forth in one of your mission UBS\nAnd that is what's going on with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and and the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article the caravan of an estimated seven thousand some saying it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants who's now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border with the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately describe on the wall Street Journal and organized stunt by political agitator as an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place\nAll of a seven seven to ten thousand on doing just showed up together in one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened with the political agitator than the activist who got this together explained that the mainstream media will do it\nWell you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of a you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised Dan criminal and mentally ill ah Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize\nAnd disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress a who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also a\nMan of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to do this you know people are just are are coming along and doing it on their own\nMeals are suddenly appearing tent suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the\nFree hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs that a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election in your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo me now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explain why here we're getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place at the same time with precision begin marching together along with food and I'm an army marches on its belly along with water intensive medical care all these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will cover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate\nA caravan that are formed the largest one that we are talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen a\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift uh not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTo Jimmy Carter's a election downfall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by left this government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance\nBecause it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nRight well let's let's let's not bail out of this fight bill we will get it and we'll win it eventually\nThey re you're a

Research Center ... well ... all one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough the good\nThey only report the bad and this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time\nIn our nation's history they've conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about\nI here's a great example just last week I think it was a President Trump did an interview with Lesley Stahl for sixty minutes she interrupted him sixty five times during that interview to put that in comparison when sixty\nMinutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him four times and they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him the credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they're no longer in the business of reporting the news and they're now in the business of making the news and that's the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night in Montana framed in his mob versus jobs the only difference is the immune to Jay and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh\nAlong about a trucks that ever Trump sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at a Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck into side with and\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the calls to violence\nBy the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's a Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break\nYou know that's not the way our country is supposed to be\nAnd I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with Sarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ...\nWhere he almost lost his life because the mob violence say\nAntifa is so out of control there you go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created I think\nOver for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want\nThis president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences that Democrats I hate to say this they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of an industry or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper that I Will watch\nNonetheless I saw it on TMZ I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure you might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records not can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad depicted Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\n... it would be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the the country artist\nWould have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her\nDo you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult he was the president of the United states\nLeader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the the converse if Donald Trump had done that with\nHow she stole the last election from Bernie Sanders right we'll put those back and plays shivering this system just like she did it last time and she'll lose worse\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again\nGive me your production in about two weeks house in the Senate give me your production\nUh I think in the Republican five increasing the majority in the house I'm going to say it's a prediction

thousands of individuals coming from those violent countries on earth is a net negative for the president I Do not believe that\nI think the main reason that Trump won the presidency and twenty sixteen and that Republicans will keep the house and when to keep the house and the Senate in about two weeks will be the fact that this immigration issue is you want to remind Americans what's at

Brett Kavanaugh having been\nConfirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the road of the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they're able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the IRS but\nYou're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats about about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington or all all over the country\nAnd then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they started not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers and then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nWhere I think it's causing a lot of harm in the center for businesses of course\nIt creates a lot of regulations that they have to fight with compliance activities are very extensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each near it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on through all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that businesses ... so\nThat an important factor in the fact that ... trillion dollars this more than the government actually ... ah either from this this is talk on the individual each year\nFor a very significant thing I'm Glad it can be turned back towel and be reduced give me\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in and begin to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nUm the rules are based on laws that were ... years ago sometimes generations ago and they are perpetrated by the administrative agency to give them the authority to all these new rules and the court\nLook at that legislation again and say wait a minute you're gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority that make this rule and there are a number of examples in the book where are you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so\nThe court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called ... do they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency then we can actually begin to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time did not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven\nArticle one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talent is a government because of the best reflects the will of the people\nBut yes it will continue to go on three thousand four thousand rules in any year because there is no discipline on the agencies right now because of the Chevron decision will Nineteen eighty four and because there isn't any a ruling from the Supreme Court says\nCongress cannot pass to the agencies its own legislative power that's a violation of the separation al ... or ...\nI Want to share the American people people when I was a thought on page Ninety five you say one recent study found that the\nCumulative cost of regulations between Nineteen eighty and twenty ... which is what a a thirty two year period reduced American economic growth by over twenty five percent\nWhich amounts to annually Thirteen thousand per person in America annually and so this is gigantic it's huge it's growing and the only entity that can truly stop it\nAnd the president can't stop at the Congress could stop it but they're fools and feckless individuals the only entity in the world that can stop it it's not a state Supreme Court because can you imagine our economy twenty five percent larger\nBecause ridiculous rules and regulations simulate affect one one thousand three hundred and eighty it's now October twenty Eighteen I assume another three thousand role is going to go into effect so unless Brett Kavanaugh and other four

uh focus again\nOn the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project but one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project\nA groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery and which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies you learned as a police officer\nWho the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist to give accurate portrayals of

might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalist hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\nHey George thanks again for having me I'm\nAbsolutely no good\nTimes on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big but does it feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd just like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know what I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last say seven eight years and focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like big foot when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd has been documented in and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago a when you were first year we kept the project how you got started on that what\nYou learned and what kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big fund encounter in the mountains of the ...\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter\nAnd they said you know Dave we you have Twenty years as a police officer or you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance or you go about it at your own pace me no year for kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out\nAnd initially I said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather and I started to bring this together and then I\nWent up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors

Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever\nBut Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there's hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance because there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're ... code red Jonathan signing would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the mission and the companies that are ... and then I think it's only three or four the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine is program where the Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast\nShe is going to say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance\nAnd the person that runs the city that Democrats in most cases they're the

and do to us if they can the second thing is is that all mine entirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people they are people\nConstructive in ten a nice things about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than the continued\nSome version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties with the communist and their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we see\nThat but I think if we do a it will provide a great context for the situation that we're in your Catholic as mine are you aware of this terrible a present state of revelations in the sex abuse

west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deals probably not going to happen Mexico's two top NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right in the south Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come and then Rob and uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than Albany you saw what happened over here with all you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just made a deal with South Korea which has spent much are much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so\nThey got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty it was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\nSo how many jobs you're talking about talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent ... people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent are are they make a big deal of if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country and the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they are they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make

you know I Love it a turtle turtle he's not here yet man he's late and I [noise]\nI've only counting of the great American thanks for listening tonight and I was always a kick to have on the president\nAnd the share his thoughts with you and uh I understand what's gonna happen a more frequently uh over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage\n... imagine this country imagine\nSome of the fallout and what about uh three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate one consequence of that will be there would not be any federal judge has confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen and then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely and the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty when I come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe that the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the United States Senate under Chuck Schumer thing about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS\nListening to Leslie stall and sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to run and I can dent in twenty sixteen\nThe only Democrat that Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would've beaten the president and America would not be right now\nMourning in America revitalization a brand new American economy three point seven percent unemployment rate crack down on the southern border we have new ... new trade deals with Canada and South Korea and Mexico the president just talked about with you and I we wouldn't have any of that stuff going on\nAnd so that's why three weeks in a day for now it is so important especially if you live in\nUh Ohio if you live in a if you live in Missouri if you live in North Dakota if you live in Florida if you live in Texas there's ... there's a few critical races that will determine whether or not the Democratic party will investigate\nOr whether the Republican Party will legislate just think about two to six years ever having no federal judges confirmed anywhere\nAt the Democratic party takes US Senate they will shut down completely they will not work with this president digging anything done including criminal justice reform reforming marijuana laws whatever it might be the president is on the precipice\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe the Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand\nA wise man told me in Washington that the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful compared to the next two years if the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that's what we'd gone through the past two years to fight cholesterol and scream to move this country forward\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be sink Trump at all costs sink the ss Trump and you know it and I know and so if you're in one of those a contested congressional districts\nWhether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is go out and vote Republican to keep the house in the hands\nOf ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be and especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that it's so competitive\nWhat like in Nevada or Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer completely in charge of the house in the Senate because at that point zero zilch NATO will get done\nCNN and et cetera is then to destroy Kanye West mode because the most loyal voters in America are black voters for the Democratic party and when African Americans figure out what the Democratic Party historically has done to them and not for them hopefully the Democratic party ... held a peg\nThanks for listening tonight big night I think having the president on is always a great joy also Bill O'Reilly the book is killing the ss and of course diamond in Silicon I don't know how we equal or exceed this kind of show next Sunday night but the great American built Cunningham will\nDo my best thanks for listening tonight and fleece I'm going to urge you if you're in one of these contested house districts are one of these great Senate races please go out and vote because the future of this country is still counting ...\nFly with you and the president [noise] some

little girl because she was so calm and he was being so nice store and here's the big problem the Republican Party is filled with\n... and ... now there's a couple of New York ... words trucks and buses\nWho were scared to death their own shadow not one Republican mail center white males senator was willing to interview a woman for the thought they'd be called sexist racist than thousand other words by liberal they gave it to a woman a woman prosecutor named Mitchell who is the single\nWorst prosecutor I haven't seen in my entire life ... you and I could have put this girl on the stand and you and I would have destroyed our bill we would have had or just a apoplectic she wouldn't know what to say her entire case sort of and ripped to shreds about five minutes and she couldn't get a decent questionnaire and Ken around the five minute questioning\nShe couldn't get it out and you got to say is true you fly all the time yes or no it isn't it true that you told there's too many you needed a ten day break to be able to drive your he isn't it true that you will not give us that there is no she gave the Washington boat isn't it true you blind yourself with a foreign ... most of your life\nIsn't it true not one single witness to boy you said in the ... came from you isn't there you go up and who\nIsn't it true that you said that in two thousand twelve you finally awakened and wits your psychiatrist because you were redoing your house and that renovation about security door is what may bring back your memories of this attempted rape\nExcept there's a problem we checked your records and you built the house you did the renovation of two thousand eight not two thousand twelve you're a liar they could have said are you a democratic operative how many Democrats did you speak to connect you with the top Democrat lawyers and George George lawyers\nTo get involved in this case they could have after a thousand questions they could've after you will they did after who paid for your lie detector test now I don't know what do you mean you don't know where's the follow up question everyone knows ... why would someone do it for free the whole thing is ridiculous\nThey could've after about a thousand issues like in two thousand twelve when you claim out of the blue you enter repressed memory of rape\nIsn't it true that in two thousand twelve Mitt Romney named three potential people would be a Supreme Court nominees and one of them was Brett Kavanaugh is that how you came to know Brett Kavanaugh isn't it true that Planned Parenthood two thousand twelve just got hit the newspapers all over the country that's in roe versus Wade make believe it was just overturned and they showed the pictures of the night Supreme Court justice\nAnd they replaced Ginsburg faced with Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney's Supreme Court nominee overturns roe versus Wade is that how you got to know his name have you decided to become a heroin or the left by making up a story I mean there's a thousand things they could have said is it true your father and CIA is it\nTrue your grandfather was CIA [laughter] it's a true your brother was working for a law firm that down and GPS fusion is that possible and you're not a democratic operative where all those questions\nHow bad is it true the bread Kevin O's mother Marilyn said John trial judge Robert bonded over the foreclosure with your parents who do you\nCall it kept me on that one because they claim he was never quite for closed down and they got the outback\nSo what she was a young girl she was standing in a in a courtroom singer parents being questioned\nBy a judge the judge and incredible power over ... of her family's life and even though eventually they came to lose out that's my understanding they did not lose the house and the judge actually in the in kind of root for them\nIt doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judge his son is going to be Supreme Court nominee there's a thousand things you could say the CIA one it's amazing that's not a conspiracy theory or debt CIA at her grandfather CIA\nAnd her brother is with a company with a law firm founded fusion GPS on all things considered\nThis and other deep state fraud conspiracy that no other way about it there's no coincidence any of this stuff but having

I Believe America's on Brett Kavanaugh outside and I believe any pull you see that says a says otherwise is another democratic ... job another lie another over sampling of Democrats\nI got a hundred letters today from my column\nAnd the Vegas newspaper which was featured at real clear politics as one of the most important columns in America today over a hundred letters Ninety five percent of them were pro I Love your your great way and what you said about Brett Kavanaugh's ... and and I'm with you and five of them were liberals\nAnd all five of them in one way or another basically told me I Hope you get murdered or ...\nI Hope someone comes in murders you or one of them had a great line they said I Hope there's a woman in your house and shrimp tonight the plunge didn't injure at his house and mentally disturbed or left is all they know how to do is talk about murdering people disagree with and then they call that's crazy I mean you're just dealing with sick\nPeople who will do anything and say anything because they believe\nA lot ... that the ends justify the means and that's why this Christine for came forward and that's why the woman at Yale came forward and that's why the ...\nCharge gang rape came forward and the next\nFive women you hear about this week are all going to be liberal women wear pink vagina ads in March and anti Trump rallies\nWho think they're saving the world by coming forward in line it's as simple as that this guy is innocent he's a boy scout is Jimmy Stewart is an easy Andy Griffith and made very are empty is a fine man at what they did as a character assassination and they're sick\nPeople there's something wrong with all of them Democrats ... there's nothing else you could say we are target number one white\nStraight Republican men are the target of the Democratic party said well we're\nOther provable fact in June of twenty sixteen Trump put on the loose the twenty five judges that would be on his list from what you would pick one of those twenty five\nAnyone I grew up in all Catholic neighborhood mostly Italian part Irish\nI was number one in my class like Rick capital I was a sports star like Brett Kavanaugh I went to Columbia He went to an Ivy League school yeah we both got out of the chief great except in life and now they're trying to destroy them and I can tell you one thing\nThat's just the way we like it came

radio more from Nineteen Seventy three coming up [noise]\n[noise] I'm shed for government to speakers\nDemocrats would likely have a shot keeping Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court were not for something known as the nuclear option\nIn twenty Thirteen than Senate majority leader Harry Reid grew frustrated with repeated filibusters from Republicans of lower court an executive branch nominees so after much consternation read look the fuse on what's known in the Senate as the nuclear option back then it took sixty votes to break a filibuster in the center on old nomination\nChanging Senate rules requires a procedural vote or sixty seven years but there was another way to lower the bar on filibusters biased abolition and do precedent\nReid didn't change the Senate rules he instituted a new precedent for breaking filibusters on all nominations except the Supreme Court reached decision incensed Republicans in the minority facing a possible filibuster last year on the nomination of Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch Republicans now in the majority return fire with a nuclear strike of their own\nLowering the bar for those nominations too\nWith the speaker's lobby ... Fox News\n[noise] I think we're connected painful and people are used water because we find everything for me she continues to be Frank what separates were divided fragment figures we bring information together\nThirty minutes on the hour\nWhen my connecting Lincoln\nWe always\nPain seven nine dogs most stimulating\n[noise]\nLike on the cutting edge of the great American and it's always good to get a female perspective you know men and women are equal but somehow were different all they're making\nMore than I generally think pretty much the same of Reagan babe dot com also great radio talk shows than Las Vegas Nevada and Meghan bart welcome to get the bill Cunningham show Megan how are you\nA great town to\nGo do it I Want to get a woman's perspective ... I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after a doctor forwarded testified ... the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForge testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about the soul to the impact it at our life and not have your heart grow up to her this was a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally I respect that I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist that Ford is a credible unbelievable\nSo when when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and the feeling is the Democrats showed toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flip completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo Tono and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho providers witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhen you have ah Christine Ford straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman wants a anonymity to testify\nTurn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out or lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I Try to test her credibility making bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking\nSo when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\n[laughter] I think we were painted Karl Rove yeah completely lost our way because he went to one telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to laugh at your testimony that the critics women and men\nI sound Brett Kavanaugh people even though there was such a notion\nFrom falsely accused in a man who end up in the court of public opinion in the current day leading up to this quote unquote hearing a life with completely turned upside down his wife with getting death threats\nAnd his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed as well and his reputation and here we have Christine horn\nThat something happened to her or she obviously has been in therapy for decades or she sat her so she has two front doors you know anybody that has to crime\nDoorbell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she has issues now just because she says something happened doesn't happen\nAnd we have plenty of examples that or just because she says Brett Kavanaugh right there it maybe not but all the evidence that she'd for that so far all start being out of it ends\nIn fact if you present innocent of Cornwall in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho would have no motivation to line or a light all\nWho said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh all the all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the ... with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it didn't have a good discount marked judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know I don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that\nI I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the presidency and twenty sixteen what the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about bread Kevin or getting the Supreme Court when his name wasn't on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Law Karl Rove and not all the\nTime is up I don't know because ... ... exactly at what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case that fell short\nOf being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility or order for a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to be the post let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing song it talks about equal rights and gender equality what are you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a mad as a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person you know so to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poke holes in the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly eyes and then we find out she was all over the world I and also just the holes in our story said thank thank God for Kaine people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd thank God for Lindsey Graham because\nThere on sexual harassment and assault against their staff or what if somebody sitting on the Judiciary Committee\nKept a secret did in the U.S Senate to Congress all the private settlement Seventeen million dollars never got out did it\nNo I don't know where we have people lecturing another example Kamala Harris she's talking about integrity and she is lecturing Brett Kavanaugh at that hearing Kamala Harris got her start on a\nBrown Haslam couch she with having a public affair with a married man when she was assistant da and San Francisco and Willie Brown with the mayor of San Francisco so I don't need a feminist like Kamala Harris\nTelling me how I should live my life or hot there should live their life and she has never had to explain those types of actions what would the me too movement say about a woman having an affair with a married man what about the Mary mountain whites\nDon't know how about Cory Booker sexually molesting a Fifteen year old girl US Senator from New Jersey no big deal right\nRight I feel\nLike we got her on ... you're the best we'll see what happens in a few days but dye pray to God Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed and all those crops thrown out really be the\nDemocrats though we beat this that's kind of politics the personal destruction character assassination at the poll we need to make sure that we show up and numbers that they can't handle and we make sure that we keep the house and keep the Senate and even grow the house\nMegan bar if you're a great American thanks for coming on to build Cunningham show thank you very much thanks so much about\nLet's continue with more Kamala Harris cutter jobs on the casting couch a mirror Willie Brown who was married to continue with more built cutting him live with you every Sunday

because he always brings the goods\nI Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found is true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon a known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great to have you back\nIn Georgia I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nWhen you say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I have not uh I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and ah\nI've put that in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these aren't the Drake who is fighting these are\nThe upper echelon and it's the conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one\nBecause it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder has the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the\nSearch effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and uh\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families\nAnd covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA runner and out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue report\nLaw enforcement report the who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search\nOr the areas that they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI I find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books who might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but uh it's really\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative back right on to be looking into it\nAnd that sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act of course it gets to national park service they have the largest contingent a federal\nThe train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get the outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks and jurisdictions\nFor like to see if\n\nLiterally therapist album houses of the holy ghost in the morning to you and the u._k. and you want to hit dire maker\nNow a year in rocks\nSpotlight
