Joe Brown was that a circle Kay my friend Joe my friend and and just see you guys can yeah he's my friend\nAh [noise] and obviously he wasn't endorsed by the end because he was ... was endorsed uh because this is my friend to the both of my friends and Martha is my friend and then you have to have loyalty towards your friends and it has nothing to with bipartisan with partisanship you know what party poured a but Joe came up to\nMe he hugged me he ... he was he was he's who he is all the time when he was fantastic\nHe's it was going on the border they fixed that what's going on cells the gift that said no job we have the same people running the agency they rented under Obama they're not doing anything well you needed to President Trump and make me make me the commissioner\nMake me the secretary a bit I'll let you guys do whatever you want as long as it's within the law and then he ... and then he says 'cause 'cause me and him talked a lot before right things and he says oh\nOh care more about the loan or care more about defending the borders that don't care about you guys growing beards and\nMost ashes what a clown show and I said what are you talking about [laughter] you know we've talked\nThese more on up in D.C are too concerned with you guys growing beards that they don't give you guys proper under drugs are not on your friend a border\nAnd I thought to myself he's so he's so right so real there's ... you have these leaders these leaders supposedly arguing with brand name John and the national board because when everyone they can think of them on on the color of boots and the ... beards\nAnd they forgot that their job is to help us figure out how to defend the border I mean jeeze and and he's so real so it was great seeing a bunch of those guys and and talking to him and I'm\nJoe ... was there ... Spencer wasn't there but jokes or was there so that\nWas fun and it was a good time is a good time so I Want to talk about ... the the by the time you guys hear this show the jury will have been select I was there\nI saw the the selection process I think George Collins is doing a fantastic job at the judge in charge of the case you're doing great\nSo I show up or I was late I was doing some Fox interviews um have another one tomorrow morning for twenty in the morning by the way raised killing but anyway um so I show up of low late I wanted to make sure that Lonny knew I was there\nYou know so I show up of course to the listeners Loni shorts was found innocent\nBut the witch hunt continues because these people are yelling for justice but justice is not what they want\nWhat they want is revenge stop asking for justice when what you truly need and want in your life is revenge and it's just a setting that they're dragging this human being through all of this garbage and shame on the prosecutor to\nAnd shame on the office of inspector general ... I've been in their office a few times with shame on them\nThey sit there and they hug on this dirt bag\nKid's brother like if they're victims\nThese guys were smuggling dope into the United states they were rocking federal agents and launched shorts pulled out is going to defend them so that is the reality of what happened and the choir boy picture that you guys are seen on the news and the choir boy picture that you see\nBy these activists groups it's garbage kid was not a choir boy he was a drug smuggling that's what he did ... so I'm going to the court case I'm literally not case but to the to the ... going to court yet and I'm seeing the New Jersey the they're selecting the jury\nAnd I run into the heck is her name gosh I always forget her name is Jessica ... Martinez is about ... ... is it about jazz about also yeah [laughter] oh\nIt's not Martinez can't remember her name right Isabelle something she's an activist right I thought she was looking for one of her Dalmatians she looks like the lady like the hundred and one Dalmatians lady right for she's out there looking for a Dalmatians ... and ... and she's running out of the court\nAnd she turns around and she looks at me and she says how shameful you are Mr does with them and that was like me and she turns around she looked she was yeah you and I and I was like you're talking to me I did it again because it was funny right right you're talking to me\nAnd she says and then she stops and she says she like I just she thought and she's like well that is the right guy and she says um\nWould you are or you weren't the weather like really confused and at this point I'm laughing a little bit and I'm like what adults\nAnd then I said yeah that's me and she says shameful all of your ads are just shameful\nThe head of the ads you're doing for ... I don't know if it's the ads I'm doing for my Sally or if it's the ads that I put on the Greenland Facebook page or if it's the ads that I put on local two five four for his Facebook page and please listeners\nGo to the local to five Facebook page it's the second story that's up right now still\nIt's it's um it's pictures of gang members that's what that's how I got a point you get the right direction but it's not gang members it's the individuals that were involved in the shooting at lunch which dependence life right but look at that share that post I Want everyone to see who these people really are not with the media is telling you they're\nSo suggests a belt no wait a minute you said it was as ... as\nThe lady looked for the Dalmatians right she turns around and she's she's she's just shameful when she walked away and she she was in a hurry\nI didn't get a chance to stop her and say well ... which which um which ad or what are you talking about right so she she ran out of their quick um I think her her broom was double part how she got to pay the parking meter and she just left or Roman attended\nSo I went upstairs and then I find out that they they they kind of kicked her out because they weren't allowing certain people in but it was it was just that the the courtroom was so packed\nRight that they couldn't have everyone in there so they just couldn't have you standing and in typical\nDalmatian form she got upset and she was all angry that they they told her to leave and all kinds of stuff but you know the public just needs to understand\nDo you want justice or do you do want revenge\nAnd you know in this day and age you can second guess officers all day long\nAnd I know some of you asked for video cameras and all that money to put this into a real quick perspective you have to make split second life and death decisions out there and you want one camera and so you can judge this individual\nIf you watch sports they have all teen billion cameras\nFor sports play and they still get it wrong but you're going to judge an officer think about that let that sink in for a second our prayers go out to lunch shorts were behind you\nI Hope that the jury that get selected does the right thing and they see this for what it is it is nothing more than a witch hunt they're not seeking justice they're seeking revenge\nLet's do the right thing to do the right thing folks\nTo next week we'll see how this invasion works out you may you may be seeing me or hearing me I'm record from some bunker I don't know\nIf you don't come along yeah okay if

com is saying is the hard radio station [noise]\nA lead Jay in Pittsburgh I'm Joe ... another mass shooting this time at a synagogue in Pittsburgh where eleventh fatalities as a result of the shooting incident\nA live to the max OK your retirement lifestyle something you can prepare for but until you experience it you can never really know what to expect so many Americans especially in the baby boomer generation are are hardworking individuals and after so many years of working it's hard to disassociate yourself from what you've\nFor a living in fact most of us man on TALK to you guys out there sadly guess what we do we tire entire self esteem up with what we've done for a job what we've done for a living to create a life for our family so we tie our our our person hood into what we've done and when we stopped doing that\nWe stopped being a lawyer at an accountant a police officer firefighter and we were done with that we're going to the next phase we kind of lose our identity sometimes\nYou don't want to do that remember you're more than just your job you're more than what you do for a living ladies and gentleman you are a miracle created by God himself and I mean that with all sincerity I don't care what your religious background I'm not here to ...\nThe ties are preached to you but I Am here to tell you you are a miracle I mean just look at your DNA and how how do our lungs keep working on our her keep beating for you know really I mean you're a miracle so you need to know that you're more than what you do for a living\nOkay so let's let's let's talk about a few more ideas so your retirement lifestyle or something you can prepare for but until you experience it never really uh you never really know what to expect so for many Americans are\nBasically we've got to think about All right you wished you'd never worked another day in your life but when that day comes you may wish for the opposite ... be careful what you wish for\nSo not working can provide a major Boyd in your life and filling that void is easier said than done so as you prepare for your financial transition from working to non working years you should also prepare for your life's transition what's your life\nGoing what's your new purpose okay\nWhy is it important to have retirement lifestyle plant retirement is a life event that's going to change your lifestyle obviously and I believe this planning is almost as important as your financial retirement planning in fact having a retirement lifestyle plan will help you determine what you want your retirement to look like\nAsk yourself these questions do you want to travel if so how often do you want to continue working if so and what capacity and doing what do you want to take up a new activity or a hobby if so what and how much time\nDo you want to spend doing it answers to these questions can help you plan out your retirement lifestyle and how you envision your retirement so also it's good to make your retirement lifestyle plan when you're healthy and independent and can make well informed\nDecision so I Know I've said before I'll say it again remember there's the go go years this logo years ... years and then go go Europe and ramp like your health is great your wife fell through your husband's health is great\nYou're off to the races a year traveling around the world going on cruises visiting your kids grandkids all around the countryside but you're doing your thing okay and then ten or so years go by and now you're in your slogan years maybe you\nCan't move around as as freely as you used to be you can still go visit the kids and grandkids on occasion holidays in such they come see you write and then you've got to know go years where one of you or both of you are confined to a facility and or you need full time care around the clock care for you\nAnd your own home okay that's gonna that's gonna adjust thanks so keep in mind if it's a very good idea to make your retirement lifestyle plan when you're healthy and independent okay\nYou can make well informed decisions so uh basically uh another question would be how much time or\nHave your class dedicated to planning for their retirement lifestyle okay well some of my clients haven't given it any thought at all usually clients have already dedicated countless years days hours to play in their retirement income\nThat's not altogether true I remember I told you last time most people spend more time planning their two week vacation than they ever do their retirement plan sadly\nThat's true it's sad\nBut it's true okay so ... but in the meantime while you're planning for your actual financial portion of your retirement let's spend a little time planning your lifestyle portion as well so they probably of grand ideas for the return of lifestyle but NO PLAN as to how they will afford that lifestyle\nRetirement dreams don't come cheap the finding resourceful ways to make your retirement lifestyle Marta ... is possible\nSo our

want your retirement to look like okay so\nUh when you're working days are done what are some ideas to stay motivated inactive during your retirement let's talk about there are multiple ways to keep you motivated when you're working days are over such as exercising exercise and it's been proven to not only provide a physical release but also a mental what in fact\nI just heard this and I am not kidding you guys I've been in a bit of a funk a mental funk a little bit of a depression depressive state over these past few months that I couldn't figure out why I'm like jeeze\nWhat's going on here right well it's because I was in the hospital year and a half ago and the doctor said stop weight training no more weight training you can get to go do cardio all day long but stopped the weights well I was listening to one of my favorite radio shows John Test radio\nA Sunday Morning about two or three Sundays ago and they have did a study at Johns Hopkins university or Harvard one of them and it said do you know that strength training has the same effect on our brains as taking an anti depressant does it increases doping meaning serotonin levels\nAnd I remember I stopped doing strength training a year and a half ago and I thought holy could\nI went back to weight training a strength training about a month and a half ago and lo and behold guess what that quote dark cloud hovering around me has dissipated dramatically know sometimes it's still there do I hate Monday's you bet your bottom dollar I'm allergic to Mondays I tell everybody\nBut most of us are right am I Am I talking to a wall here do most of you out there listening that's still have a jail be considered Monday's like you're held day right it is it I don't know why that is it's psychological I Know but I'll tell you something get back to the gym and do some strength training I don't mean push it to the max here\nBut if you're used to doing bench press with a hundred and fifty pounds job but to Seventy five pounds it's still bench press it'll still keep going okay or some chin ups pull ups whatever a leg presses squats ... curls for your buys and push down for your triceps all kinds of things\nBut they are all kinds of things we can do okay and I I've I assure you if you feel that same dark cloud hovering go hit the gym and get some strength\nTraining and I promise it'll lessen okay so again a in other ways to volunteer volunteering can connect you to community gives you a sense of purpose and most importantly make an impact in someone else's life and ladies and gentlemen is it that really what life's all about\nTo God and when we get down to it isn't making a difference for others are real core passion and I know there's a few super selfish people out there that could give a rat's butt about what I'm saying right now\nWell they're the few there the ten percent they are not the Ninety Ninety percent of our population I promise you feels exactly like I'm Talking right now they want to give okay if you won the lottery I guarantee most of you out there\nWouldn't go spend it on your cell she'd want to go help your family and friends get out of debt right away especially with this Powerball going on right now imagine winning a billion dollars can you stop and think for a moment a grand you're only going to get keep about half of it but it\nHalf a billion dollars five hundred million\nThat's more than you could live on in a lifetime you got to think to yourself OK if I got more than enough to take care of me and mine what else am I doing and seriously what would you do

what's wrong it must be something in the water in Honduras rape but they want to fight\nAnd even now with catch and release still going on\nThey still want to fight yeah it's like they're going to release you ice is going to pretty much release you why do you want to fight but\nObviously in the Tucson sector there's there's a huge amount of cartel members and drug smugglers that we have to encounter yeah and I think that's why it's important it's great and it's fantastic because agents have the opportunity to do this ...\nWhich is they have an hour during their shift where they can you know do some kind of physical activity to stay in shape and measured because it's your life right that's the outcomes absolutely um\nAnd here you have it you know if you're in Tucson you have that option to be able to train with a real Brazilian jujitsu black though\nThat's what it comes down to you know I'd rather have the upper hand right right and ... and he said it I think Chris did a fantastic thing that has to resume into a lot of people's minds\nAnd even if you're not of course when you hit it has to resume because things are different than they used to be you know what I mean there's a lot of violence out there and I\nMean he says just four to six months\nOf training or something is going to help yeah and I think that's a big deal I was I was listening to um ... McNamara who we've had before on a show and I was listening to what he had said today and and I follow him on his social media and he said something very cool this morning where\nHe's a very intense individuals people that you've heard about the show he says\nYou gotta wake up every morning\nWith the mentality you have to do something to make yourself better than your yesterday absolutely particularly when it comes to the violence that there is in this world because you can shelter yourself and say there is no right as you can try to stop you could sell to your kids\nBut it's we live in a wider world and she said you have to wake up two day\nTraining something so you could be able to kick your butt from yesterday yeah right and he and and Chris is now the same thing is twice I've heard it in one day which is that's what it comes down to ... Chris we'll train you so\nSix months from now you can beat yourself up today [laughter] you know what I mean right I mean that's what it comes down to and I think it's important that in the mirror every day time to start graying beard yeah yeah I Do with the beard [laughter]\nAh but do you know what I mean I think is fantastic to see that and to hear that in in to see what options he gives agents it's another tool you look at agents to carry their gun they're they're asked their old sea spray that just different things\nHere's another tool that you don't have to worry about I'm a pouch to carry on your belt and it's a tool that you can carry for the rest of your life and that's what's important so I'm really happy I was able to have him on I think it was fantastic\nThere's there's up we had a ... a lot of other things planned on the show we wanted to talk about the issues of ice and all kinds of stuff I had some notes that I wrote down a on the incompetence of some leaders\nUm and I won't be able to get to those either or but it was just I I've been going through some issues with trying to deal with sector on some things and it always bothers me when I talk to these managers and\nThey say well wait for an email response or I'll Wait for it and the second show\nWhere they are wrong and they know the wrong and you can have an another leader in that room to\nHigher ranking that debt than them that tells them hey you're wrong right and they'll say okay that are still waiting for your email and that thing is just frustrating I've been dealing with that or they said and get your email right it's because they're scared to be responsible they're not responsible individuals\nAnd like I've said before\nNot everyone but unfortunately\nUnited States border patrol continues to promote mediocrity and and I think now they're even lowering the bar they're promoting failure which is angering me but we have a lot of good leaders to and and I'm hoping that there'll be some promotions here soon on on some leaders that I\nThink are great leaders cool I Can't talk about who they are but that's my leave it at that rented my seed folks\nWe've come to the end of the show a thank you so much for listening to us thank you for I'm listening to a ... interview with Chris\nReach out to him he's a Tucson now you got you can add that extra tool to your belt that we think is very important for survival\nUntil next week though [noise]\nViews and opinions expressed in this episode are solely those of the hosts ... they do not necessarily reflect the positions or policies of the national border patrol council the United states border patrol any other government agency board this station [noise]\nCourse meal with your immune to it on that last\nOne is from the region will studio your local sushi areas where you can well darn calm day and then the other night and I are radio station\n... news alert I'm Rogers during Brett Kavanaugh expected to be sworn in this evening after vice president Mike Pence announced today's vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation the eyes or fifty\nIt's also good to review the Iranian bank account retirement accounts and for one case for updated beneficiary information is is critical because wills will not insure that your assets passed to you or your loved ones\nBeneficiary designations are the only way to ensure that assets goaded those you intend them to go to life insurance annuities for one case should all be reviewed to ensure proper beneficiary designations\nFor this reason Tony you may want your children to be the direct beneficiary of your four one K. but you may want your wife only your wife to be the beneficiary of your life insurance and or\nAny other account you may have for example okay so we want to be clear that we've planned properly in advance so after you are gone your wishes are fulfilled that screwed\nSo um anyway it's also a good to make sure that uh\nUh we've got bank account CD counts individual broker counts are also wind up and they are susceptible to probate a ... as you must have signed transfer on death designation so\nA nifty way to do that or what we're teaching our clients is to go get a an additional signature put on your checking account or savings account so add one of your children the ... the child you trust the most are the one that will be the executor or or that person you know is going to help manage the affairs if you are in the past it\nGet them added another way to accomplish that is go get a trust and have all of your checking account bank accounts and such CDs thrown into the trust then they do become probate\nThree says this kind of critical but without this feature your assets will pass through probate and be distributed according to the court instructions not necessarily your instructions\nYeah people need to know that yeah I think that's key right there and this is good information so what other steps T. J. do you encourage us to take our listeners out there to take before the loss of a spouse\nWell or a couple of steps I Would encourage people to consider taking Tony or if your spouse is a veteran\nGovernment life insurance center veterans' benefits may be available to you it's good to verify if there are any okay and uh\nAnother is to initiate important estate planning documents at the very least meet up with an attorney or a paralegal and\nAnd uh your community and hopefully most of you listening or in Tucson so meet up with someone here in Tucson at the very least you should have the will power of attorney trust guardianship for any minor children and or a\nHealthcare documents in place so once you're a state plane documents are finalized\nSelect what I Would call it a state administrator or an executive someone you trust that's responsible for following the rules of your will in the event you ah when you pass away so you should think about how your death will impact the decision making ability of that person once elected\nAnd sent copies of your state plane documents to them as your executor administrator at least make sure they're in the loop and they know where to find a guy\nAnd last ah and ah maybe most importantly it's a great idea to select a financial planner in which you and your spouse or comfortable with and this should be someone you trust to be with you for the decisions you will make for the rest of your life and the U.S that's worth triple\nAgent TJ how potentially come into the mix if you don't have one or you're not worth enough to garner someone else's attention as we said last week we want to take care of the little guy so if you're worth less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars we are your guy we want to talk okay we can help\nWow well I think that's great and our time is just about up for this first segment of the show is there anything else that you'd like to share with our listeners before we take a quick commercial break here are\nPreparing for the loss of a spouse can be overwhelming and it doesn't have to be so so I'd like you to take a moment visit my Web site\nAT T Jay how dot com that T.

shore\nWe've been talking about protecting the surviving spouse in the event that one passes away and we've covered the probability\nOf someone living longer than their spouse which is a very high likely a probability and that the majority of lives outlive their husbands and how people can prepare for the loss of their spouse\nYeah it's been a great show so far TJ and you always have a lot of wisdom and this is important stuff that we all need to know and you mentioned in the last segment or some things we can do to prepare before the loss of a spouse what are some things we should do after the passing of a spouse\nA that's a great follow up question so there are several things so when the loss of his spouse occurs there are a whirlwind of emotions in decisions that need to be made in the last thing you want to do is worry about\nYour finances I'm a I just want to really drive this point home Tony when you've been with your spouse for an excessive thirty forty fifty years right\nYou are going to have enough grief or to last a lifetime when your spouse goes your partner goes okay and so you we do not want you to be in a position where you have to rush to make any rash decisions any major decisions involving finance is\nIn fact a lot of experts out there say they recommend taking a year before you make any major financial decisions whatsoever so therefore if that be the case\nWe want to absolutely make sure we've done the planning and and preparation so that you're not forced into a decision that you may regret later because if you haven't done the planning guess what you're going to be forced to make some decisions right now\nBurial cremation or burial you know a good paying this person paying that person getting rid of this bill getting rid of that building so far so\nBasically I Would lay it down this way Tony the first thing a person should do after the devastating loss of a spouse is to update their beneficiary information immediately after a life changing event\nBeneficiary form should be updated and reviewed to ensure that all are up to date no changes need to be made that includes your life insurance your four one K. and or your spouse's four one K. because now becomes your four one K. now his IRA becomes your IRA\nThey're a account speak their duties become your annuities so you want to update all those to\nMake sure they're going to who you choose for them to go to and uh as hard as it may be another step that uh the spouse should take is to converse on any important issues that need to be addressed this conversation could include discussing your wishes with children\nOr loved ones and or making sure you have the health care directive in case of the tragedy\nWell that's good information at great advice I think that's very important now what are some other ways that we can be prepared or or prepare for the loss of a spouse or\nAnother way I Would consider preparing as to consolidate your financial records\nI Would consider account numbers contact information Social Security numbers passwords maiden names secret keys or past votes to accessing online information also consult with the financial advisor to ensure your assets are structured to pass the maximum amount\nOf legacy to your heirs as the only living parent now your death will trigger the benefits to primary and continued beneficiaries so you don't

current the student we didn't even bring him up to the Mike which is just crazy but Joe I promise sometime soon we will have you on here and we were talking about your security job AT Metro because that is a story that I think the listeners want to hear I Will be bringing that up\nI Am going to switch gears one more time I've been doing a lot during today's show how can I add a young you're switching gears which I'm sure that that's what I Do\nIt you might get a ... for for the information of the agents is great right I drank a ... a big monster before I got on and then uh I'm not endorsing this product are usually but I also I found this product called grinds which is like tobacco fused with like more caffeine\nAnd that's what you need B. twelve and ... and all kinds of stuff and ... it's called the grinds black coffee pouches oh yeah yeah they're really good uh they keep you awake it's better than monster is it like I don't drink coffee you'll you'll take it in a pouch\nYes ... just released into that they're just gonna they're gonna they're they're going to try to figure out how to turn that around I mean think fly and the interest or love it\nAlong the Rio Grande there's some backlash to President Trump's push to speed this border wall construction\nAnd I guess ... homeland security department of homeland security department or they made a decision last week to speed the construction and it was a border wall and the lower Rio Grande valley and it has pretty much upset a lot of these residents just as the mid term election isn't site um\n[noise] I'm not trying to attack anyone or see anything but if\n[noise] I don't know man how can I Do it without attacking people I'll never be able to do that now so let's just go straight to the point\nCould just be somebody's Obama holdovers that I keep on talking about\nRight before the midterms you're going to try to push this\nUh I mean I don't know or is it is it obviously President Trump asked to push the border wall construction and where we at but it was it was a homeland security decision to speed the construction in in a area where it's very controversial\nUm and then obviously we have a little Francis down there a poncho he likes to be called poncho because he likes to believe that he's Hispanic so little punch O'Rourke um you know is peace talks his voter interest by reminding them about President Trump's plans\nAre I think he forgot that will pass or ... miles and miles of border fencing and because of it all passwords regularly cited as being one of American safest cities\nDole talking to some old Paso guys uh those polls may have been a little tainted too you know what I mean like you and it's it's obvious I mean they can be that's safe you got water is just south of there which is just a dangerous city some of its spills over the past\nBut I don't know if the timing is right\nObviously no there's miles of gaps that separate segments of walls constructed a decade ago and hardly any of it is imposing as the bear that President Trump has envisioned\nSo somebody's residents are very angry that the administration decided to waive environmental and other regulations half way through a two month comment period\nIt's crazy but as you've ... you've heard some of our guests today obviously Steve for running for district nine seen firsthand\nThe issues out there and knowing the importance of a better barrier marks Spencer sharing his experience and the death of law enforcement officers at the hands of illegals that come into the into the United states\nWe know it's important it's important to build a better barrier\nMy problem a little bit is that we have areas here in Arizona namely over sixty linear miles on the ... up from reservation where not only is the barrier less than than what we need it the leaves a lot to be desired right let's say\nBut also there's certain technologies it's hard for us to work because of all these regulations and and the holy land and what's not hold in I mean I don't want to get into that because that's not the religious aspect but obviously we need to start taking the security of our country serious\nBut you know the other thing too it seems to me agents need the technology that is available because right now there was a story that just came out last week about a one of the tunnels they found those solar equipped right solar eclipse that means you're getting the technology if they get they can't have better technology than our agents on the ground it should not be that way\nThis is where it it upsets me that we have representatives and I know Steve for our talked about it border security and\nTurning your family is an American citizens it it has nothing to do with party it has everything to do with just your securing their country and if you run for a position\nOf political office within the United states shooting regardless of party shoot into your priorities be towards the American citizens that you are representing me because it's pretty simple I mean it just it's just it's not hard to figure that one out\nRepresentative bin ... Gonzales he's a congressman or down in ... called the plan to build the wall and I'm going to quote him\nA monument to waste of money that's what he said\nHow I mean that's just insane uh and he said we look at it in terms of common sense does it work\nHe says is it offensive to our friends and neighbors to the south that's when it comes down to\nA Vincent Gonzales Vinnie let me tell you\nIt works look at ... Frances ... your buddy his home town is a prime example down in El Paso areas where we've put better barriers or prime examples that it decreases in detour as the people that are entering in those areas\nWhy should we even care that it's offensive to our neighbors I'm not offended that my neighbor has a fence between his home in mine that's the dumbest argument you can think of I'm not offended or you know that my neighbor has a pool and I don't have a pool that doesn't offend me\nI take care of my family and make sure that my people are secure like I said earlier I don't hate my neighbor\nBut I Love my people in my house and that's what it comes down to it's ridiculous to have that argument of it it doesn't make sense of we're going to send our neighbors to the south you know what I'm sick and tired of being told that we need to set the example people need to start paying attention that no one's following our example that's the reality\nUm lots of things that we do to not upset her neighbors to the south one of the issues that humongous here and it's it's very it's going to be hard for the listeners who understand this but there's actual firearms training\nThat are agents have received that has been cut down because of funding yet that same firearms training that should've been given to our agents is now being given to the Mexican federal police\nWell how ridiculous is that to cut the training of our own men and women that are defending our borders but you're going to give it to another country and oh well we want to maintain good relationship\nYou know what is that that old saying Andy big fences make good neighbors yeah\nThat's the reality when you just start taking care of our own people first\nAnd whatever's leftover we can help out that's the reality folks thank you so much for another edition I Hope you enjoyed it I think it was huge it was it's been a long day along busy day we've been out on the border we had Steve Ferrara don't forget them\nMarks Spencer my friend ... a council chaplain\nAnd he had on the sidelines jokes or we'll talk about him and his other issues later but it's always a pleasure to have all of you guys hear Andy another fantastic job like his are huge shout out to Lee thank you for the notes and a big\nHeart felt shout out to all the agents of Wilcox station and of course\nThe never forgotten and always remembered ... border patrol agents in the northern border I Love you guys all thank you for listening to the Greenland until next time stay safe\nViews and opinions expressed in this episode are solely those of the host and gas they do not necessarily reflect the positions or policies of the national border patrol council the United states border patrol any other government agency or this station [noise]\nAnd we were ... you don't laugh\nFrom the region will studio your local area for you dot com is gay and it's the instant wins and high art radio station [noise]\nThe Saudis story ... Fox News Saudi Arabia's citizens arrested a team in connection with the death of ... at the consulate in is ten bowl the kingdom says to show the died after a fight broke out but there's worldwide skepticism over this statement\nAnd when people get stressed they want to push it down the road let's procrastinate Martha let's not get to that today right is this not this Saturday we got to go here and here you know\nSo again a but sometimes later sadly never comes and many people find themselves applying for their Social Security before they reach the age of ... pay out of their benefits so they're exposing their four one K. is are there either race\nThe high levels of market risk and living on a fixed income that does it for them the lifestyle that they are accustomed to enjoying she got a lot of actors going on\nNow our time is almost up for this portion of the show is there anything else you want to add before we take a quick break here TJ\nYes sir preparing for retirement whether the understanding your Social Security benefits are learning about common mistakes to avoid can be overwhelming and even nerve wracking at times\nSo I'd like you to take a moment right down if you're not driving don't do this if you're driving but if you're not driving right down my website which is T.

how\nThe the loving care caregivers you can trust deal better in the comfort of your own home we specialize in care and daily living assistance to an array of individuals\nWhether unique daily or

zero that's five to zero four four zero five one six zero\nThese strategies can help you leverage more from each one of the hard earned dollars you set aside for your retirement I remember some people filed for Social Security on day one of their retirement that's not always the smartest moved to make others will rely on supplemental income from an IRA or other retirement account such as a four one K.\nAh and then working with a bright angel professional such as myself or or someone like me can help you determine\nYour best course of action so is it the right move to jump right down the Social Security office maybe so but maybe not again why don't you come get some advice on when the best timing for you is for you and your family that helps\nOh yeah it's huge it helps a lot so ah how do we know though which strategy is going to be the most beneficial to us\nTony that's a great question and I would answer it this way just like no to people's DNA are like\nA note to people's situation is exactly alike so it's not a one size fits all a process here ladies and gentlemen less ... let me let me say that again each person's situation is completely unique and different than the next so each each program or or or strategy that we create will be unique\nAnd and customize to that specific family or individual and their specific situation so\nAdvice about what to do with money has been around as long as money's existed hindsight allows us to see which advice was good in which advice didn't cut the mustard the reality is that investment strategies in savings plans that worked in the past\nHave encountered challenging new circumstances that have turned them on their heads in these days so remember the great recession of the early to thousands highlighted how old investment ideas were not only ineffective but incredibly destructive to their retirement plans have millions of Americans\nAs you will recall you remember the term Toni my four oh one case turned into a two oh one K. was that was a very popular little catchphrase that came about and\nTwo thousand eight okay so so the reality uh again or perhaps the most important lessons people learn from the great recession and I'm going to go so far here Tony let's just say that wasn't a recession that was a flat out depression we just don't want to admit so\nBut uh it was two thousand eight was not a recession and it was a depression but because of that uh it it is that not understanding where your money's invested in the potential risks of those investments can work against you\nYour plans for retirement and your legacy so whereas some as sources of advice that been around for very long time\nWhile there are some basic investment concepts that have stood the test of time\nMost strategies that work adapt to changing conditions in the market in the economy and the world as well as changes to your personal circumstances\nAnd as we know Tony\nWe're in a twenty four seven news cycle these days with social media Facebook Twitter yadda yadda I mean Jesus that the president the United states God Bless them but he uses Twitter more than anybody I think I've ever seen right but my point is we are bombarded with such\nConstant chronic diarrhea of information that it is we're in a whole different stratosphere than we have ever been before this ... this point or less yeah different stress here\nYeah I I think it's ... it's huge it really is a changing world out there especially when it comes to finances and um I think that uh we need to look at some of these ideas um so what are some new ideas that would be helpful to people in retirement or at least fast\nApproaching retirement well uh I I Would say there's a concept where there are essentially two kinds of money\nAnd I know we talked about the past but I'd like to review it there's hope so money and no cell money\nUnless just briefly divide that so everyone can divide their money into these two categories all of you somehow have more of one kind and you know there are so here we go we have hope soon we have no so the goal isn't to eliminate one kind of money but to balance them\nAs you approach retirement so let me briefly define\nWhat is hope so hope so money would be what we at triple age would refer to as red red or yellow money ... money is money a complete risk money in stocks individual stocks bonds are\nOverseas investments you know maybe limited partnerships in such okay so really high risk kind of stuff that's that can drop on a dime and and disappear tomorrow or or double can double or it can disappear okay that's Redmond you ... your money is a little little bit safer but still still somewhat at risk\nYellow money would be managed portfolio such as mutual funds or ATS or actual professionally managed accounts like you would see from an R. I. A. or if they do Sherry where they actually professionally manage their own portfolios and money\nBut they're still professionally manage which means someone is watching over your money pretty regularly daily or or every other day or weekly at the least right but still it's connected to the stock market in some form or fashion so there's still that little bit of risk\nThat if they weren't watching it close enough they could take a bit of a ...\nWhereas the nose so your nose so money that's what we called green money and I refer to green money Tony as just safe stuff cash in the bank money markets CDs\nOr money in your under your mattress at home although I don't know how safe it is from being robbed or burglar rise but you know if if no one knows where it is but you then I'd say it's pretty safe OK yeah cash cash life insurance cash value life insurance that's very safe\nAnnuities very safe so or pensions Social Security those would be considered green money or no so money\nSo again we we are eliminating one or the other category we just want to make sure that they become balance so we're we're uh I Know we're running out of time for this segment but I Will provide more information as soon as we come back from our our last commercial breaks all are given a a little more detail Tony on how we can help manage that\nYeah and I look forward to that or do you have any comments before we take a quick break here\nYou sure do you bet ladies and gentlemen again take a moment and write my website down so you can pay a visit to it if if and when you're not driving that is W.

their Hispanic background yeah that should be insult of to you any Taylor's might produce trade offs on the show he wants to ask\nYou real quick question I have to answer your question on yeah I Love I Love aviation so it's a little off track how you feel about the tea thirty eight being read retired\n\nThirty eight but it's a very old airplane and uh you know some airplanes do you need to be retired as a move on to other ones that you know I flew an H had war dog it you know and I've been to a higher Leslie advocate indicate that flying not just because I flew it actually the teen thirty seven and that\nYou know in the bone yard you can go visit ah but you know if we've got cable replacement on the training side that's important to modernize that but we have no place in right after the age had and I know many agents are veterans as well you know I Want to you guys I deployed six times I got three hundred and twenty five\nCombat hours like I Know and it means to serve you guys what's your lives on the line every single day even if you didn't serve in the military you're serving in uniform right now to keep our country safe it's just as important for national security we

the dial stay tuned you're going to enjoy our topic today it's a dealing with an unstable market okay the title is show is dealing with an unstable market in the last segment we covered the fear gauge\nWhich measures expected market volatility and the color of money which is used to help people allocate their assets which are broken down into three groups red yellow and green money just to recap red money is that money that's exposed to more risk and can fluctuate with the ups and downs of the stock market\nYellow money is what I Would prefer referred to as manage money professionally manage money it's usually has a cohesive strategy behind it that is implemented by a professional money manager\nAnd finally green money is typically more safe\nAnd dependable it's there again when you need it in fact I tell people in my workshops which by the way I forgot to mention last segment my next workshop is right around the corner this uh [noise] uh Thursday and Saturday the eleventh and the thirteenth\nThe eleventh and the thirteenth of October at Pima college east campus and then we're doing another uh our next workshop is October twenty fifth in twenty seven at the Pima college

mark on your calendar this Thursday the eleventh and the thirteenth and ... uh two weeks from now on the twenty fifth and twenty seven at the Pima college downtown campus\nAt six thirty PM Thursday evening followed by ten am Saturday morning okay so again uh uh but ... green money is money that has a guarantee comes with a guarantee the you\nKnow you can never lose your original principle [noise] so what should someone do to help prepare themselves for volatile market\nWell let's jump into that it's helpful to begin by creating an investment strategy and investment strategy is defined as a set of rules behaviors or procedures they guided investor to select the appropriate investment portfolio that best fits their specific situation no to investors are like just like no two people are like\nIt's important to understand your needs and goals for retirement have an investment portfolio tailored to your objectives\nRisk tolerance and your time horizon or remember you and your neighbor or not\nThe same so whatever your neighbors doing does not necessarily mean that's exactly what you should be doing when you're sitting around the Thanksgiving table this Thanksgiving and your brother in law spelled enough oh you should buy this stock or that\nPortfolio have this bond or that David and so on that may be good for him and his family but it may not be the right choice for you because your goals and objectives may be completely different so just like\nYour DNA no two portfolio should look identical either\nOkay so yeah it's important to understand your needs and goals for retirement and they have an investment portfolio Taylor do your directives and your risk tolerance so it's good for you to make sure your portfolio is individually focused\nSome clients are thrown into arbitrary categories and don't received a portfolio that they should have to meet their goals with any investment strategy always keep in mind that you can get drawn into it and don't let your emotions get the better of you while you can't control the ups and downs of the stock market you can't control how you react to them\nAnd having the knowledge to be ready for a volatile market with a tailored investment strategy can help with making sure you make the right decisions for your future\nSo how can the color of money help with creating an investment strategy as we mentioned earlier in the show the color of money helps you organize your assets in the market most people spend the majority of their working years trying to build their retirement nesting\nWhile many people folks on how to accumulate a retirement nest egg often times they don't think about where their retirement asset should be invested accumulating read accumulating a retirement nest egg is certainly\nA a most important and I feel like in some cases it may be just as important to have your money and assets that represent\nThe risk or safety that my clients want a this is where the color of money comes into play are from AAA financial group is put together a simple way that showcases the showcases the benefits of red yellow and green money\nAs mentioned earlier each color has a unique benefit and unique feature involved as properly colored asset allocation can help to provide my clients\nWith her retirement that they want and deserve\n[noise] so how do I help clients allocate their assets in order to help them achieve their retirement goals\nWell here's what we do no matter how challenged they're successful someone has been financially there's always unanswered questions or concerns people have a they'll also have questions like how much risk taking how much safety will I get and how much is the right fit of each so retirements a pretty big life is that would you agree\nHopefully the answer's yes you're shaking your head you would agree therefore\nIt needs to be taken seriously and I want to help as many clients or prospective clients understand what their options are that are available to them to help them meet their goals\nIt's important to note that everyone's situation is different and I pride myself on giving each of my clients of personalized service that they deserve which can help determine the right amount of risk for them\nWhile each person's situation berries there are some concepts like the color of money that can help all of us achieve our retirement goals and dreams\nSo this is important to understand a but they're also a wasted deal and prepare for an unstable market\nOkay so let's talk about that organizing your assets understanding your color of money and creating an incumbent accumulation plan for retirement can quickly become an overwhelming task it is your responsibility to figure out if your income and accumulation needs are being met but you don't have to do that alone\nConsulting with the financial professional may be a wise approach to calculating your risk level a professional can help determine your risk tolerance by getting to know you asking you a set of questions and even giving you a survey to determine your comfort level with different types of risk\nIn our case we have an eleven question questionnaire\nThat it creates that colored money risk analysis we talked about or colored money report so it's a field felt found deal it's we're asking you how you feel about loss and instability and how you feel about safety instability and we're just going to get a feel for how you are and then we come up with a risk score and\nThen we base to report on that risk or\nOK so a professional such as myself can help determine your risk tolerance by getting to know you and and again going through this survey to determine your level of comfort with the types of risk you're taking at a hearing to sound investment a principal or principles such as asset allocation\nRegular portfolio review and managing risk can help you achieve long term success in the end it comes down to your personal tolerance for risk as a I guess I'd ask you to ask yourself this question how much\nRisk am I willing to take that's a big one how much risk am I willing to take [noise] so uh we're we're about to the end of our next segment ladies and gentleman so uh [noise] I'm going to just throw this out again uh my company has triplets financial group [noise]\nAnd uh in our planning process it is truly to provide our clients with clarity
