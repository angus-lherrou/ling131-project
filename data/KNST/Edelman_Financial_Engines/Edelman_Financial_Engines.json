be part of your resume and now I Do know that the list will see all next Saturday starting seven o'clock sharp [noise]\nHomeowners would call our office looking for a contractor to do repair work on

they're a multi generational Arizona business that had been treating customers ride for as long as we can remember if you've got damage to your home that being covered by insurance [noise] strongly suggests to call to ... construction are you a contractor here the great state of Arizona and have been for at least five\nAs long as I live how can I make sure that it pays my bills like my paycheck did how can I make sure my bucket list\nItems can be taken care of within that income you know don't leave those all to chance you know how expensive is your budget and I think the biggest thing that people are probably hate to do is that budget\nPackage it yeah it's it's not as funny and exercise to do that knowledge is power and\nWhen you know where you're spending money what you're spending your money on it gives you more power to say is this necessary do I need this is this the my stories just say I want and can you cut back and we'll talk a little bit more about that when we get into\n'em that that I Know we said it many many times when you're getting ready to retire that five years before maybe even ten years for some people\nIt's a time where they actually do a paradigm shift between accumulating those assets and then turning them into income and if you are relying solely on assets in your retirement to draw down especially now looking what's happening in the market everybody starting\nThere is a little bit of panic out there that if your money is not in a safe position and now they're a couple of weeks and this downturn or correction if you will\nAnd the market could wipe out or severely damaged somebody's nest eggs\nAnd it just depends on how you deal with those of a market fluctuations are you are you prepared with enough safe money that will carry you while you wait for the market to return are you going to get scared because too much of your money is at risk are you taking too much risk because you're a little complacent because the markets been going so well for so long\nThat to you know if you listen to the news we're in this new era again and the economy's great so that means the market's great that's not always necessarily true sometimes the market has its own little mind and does its own little things and\nAnd can catch us by surprise in fact I think this if you look at it the stock market does more to determine the economy than the economy does to determine the stock market\nUm you know the economy was clipping along pretty well back in the uh uh two thousand and eight but as soon as they found out that all that collateralized mortgage obligations of some of the banking\nStrategies that I think we're a little unethical a lot of ethical they weren't really real um blew up and the financial markets face and then all of a sudden when the market crashed that's when the economy got bad and we went into recession and had that long recovery real estate crash market crash a lot of people lost their\nIRA money there four one K. money and they were caught by surprise and had to adjust their lifestyles\nSo what you do what you don't want to do is get too complacent with a good economy assuming that the economy is going to drive the market it does to a degree but it's the market decides to correct or of Wall Street decides to take profits or if banks just decided to take profits or if interest rates go up and people stop buying houses and things in in in such unemployment rate um things can happen\nWhere the market softens and if people start accepting the market um that could create a ripple effect so again um\nYou know we need to take risk under consideration when he'd take income sources into consideration we'll talk more about that as we go but um as far as if you're ready to retire it it's there is no right or wrong answer it really depends on what\nYou need to know what you can uh survive on what your lifestyle is going to be and um you know what do you need for your paycheck and what you need for your plate checks and going to go from there\nI Know when we get clients coming and they're pretty I'm\nStressed out or or somebody and filled with anxiety about making that switch and taking some of their money out and as risky market positions and putting them into secure\nAnd other vehicles that protect you from market last at once they do is they finally make that decision there's always this sense of relief for them they have they know that they don't have to worry about the market going up and down anymore that there is that added sleep insurance for\nRight life's too short to stress out especially when you're retired no never checked me ... well you know ... and one of the analogies that that has come up and we've talked about is you know how how income and investments are kinda like a balancing act if you can envision a a poll on a folk rumor or teeter totter so to speak and you've got\nYou know buckets are on one side that are considered assets basically all your savings and you've got other buckets on the other side that include income\nStream she might have your Social Security or pensions the income that you take out of your four one K. or your IRA you're required minimum distributions or nudity that you purchase those or income streams and those income streams need to be balanced on that teeter totter so to speak\nWith those assets on the other side and if you don't have enough assets that incomes to Hi\nYou're out of balance if the um income is\nOr the if the income is lower and you have a lot of assets maybe you can increase that income but you can balance it out is kind of a retirement planning really is a balancing act and that's why we encourage you to come in for retirement readiness\nPreview and see if you are ready to retire to see if your goals can be met see if you're ready to live that ideal retirement life now or maybe if you need to work a couple more years but that of that discussion is a you know free of any obligation or charge you can give us a call at five to ... to one seven eighty five sixty six that's five to a two and seven\nEighty five sixty six will cover all five points of the\nPillars of retirement we call them the income plan\nInvestment plan the health care plan and also you're safe way to look up all five of those in our retirement British reveal your calls five Seventy five or you\nMay call it quits

most current and up to date information and financial strategies to help secure your retirement use out [noise]\nThat's the type of thing that you really love to hear because I don't think they believe that could be done\nBut they were also believing based on these rules of thumb taking risk into consideration realizing that market crash ... and they couldn't go all out\nBut when we showed them how about a fifty fifty split between guaranteed assets principle protected assets could guarantee them enough income that they wouldn't have to worry about the other half of their assets or that they could use those other half of the assets in a more discretionary manner that they had enough to live on a six figure income for life and\nNot work till they're Seventy and that was that was that those are one of the best moments in my life is to see how happy people get when they realize that they're not doomed to this\nYou know decade or more of a work that they're actually closer to retirement than they thought they were so\nIf you want to see if you're ready or to see if you can maybe retire earlier than expected that's another positive thing that may come out of that retirement readiness review\nAll you have to do to get one is called five to ... to one seven eighty five sixty six and we'll talk about those five points of retirement your income play on your investment plan your tax plan your health care plan and your legacy or your um estate plan\nSo before we go into our next break maybe we could just talk about a couple of the strategies to create more savings before retirement for those of you are\nThat's actually where I have is going to go that if you do get the answer to that question can I can retire and it's no aggressively looking at saving more\nAnd that doesn't mean saving aggressively that doesn't mean oh hey I got to buy more apple and Amazon I don't want to you know we're not talking about aggressively investing we mean I'm I'm ... let's say I'm

we're talking about today and it's your money welcome back I'm Jeff open your host with my co host ...\nWelcome back welcome back to you\nLast little uh a break we are talking about the ways to well if you have to delay retirement to save a little bit more to make sure that we're ready what are some of those strategies that we can use we talked about well he's talking about the change bucket if up your change the little things that up um talked about um\nYou know basically getting on a budget learning to live on it for a while um work a little longer right what else\nAre they even taking care of our taking advantage of the catch up her vision and your IRA adding a little extra every year\nMaximizing the savings um you can also delay retirement if you love your job that's not necessarily a bad thing I hate to be the bearer of bad news when people come in and say you know this is what we want to leave when we really need it but are we ready and and honestly to to to give us a guaranteed retirement life\nIf it can't be done and we're not going to be the bears of a good news when there is not you know unfortunately we have helped me out of the reality check and yeah\nIt's a reality check means well you know you might have to work a little longer doesn't necessarily mean you have to stay on the same job\nYou know how many times that we've had people that have gone into either consulting in that line of work are gone to part time for a few extra years rather than fulltime for you know having a an extra year or two of miserable fulltime work might be easily exchange for maybe five years a part time work and still get to the same point\nUm we just had to come in last week that that did that he got a job I mean I may not be able to say that it that I bought it let's say where but anyway I was just so little hardware homebuilders store and he's working for like Thirteen bucks an hour but he's making just enough to where he can delay of Social Security and get back to that income level that he wants to have in a few years\nAnd guess what he loves the job not only that they even give him I'm a part time benefits for his part time work he gets benefits are in the form of reduced um [noise]\nI'm costs healthcare al ... which is kind of nice as I care done now and he's not sixty five so he's automatic everybody's got a few years ago\nAnd he ended up hating his job enough to leave but that part time job is going to fill the gaps so again we can always work a little bit more\nBut we're seeing my clients coming in wanting to retire prior to their full retirement age either sixty six sixty seven\nAnd you got to remember there that that is adding extra expenses that you may not be I'm planning for cars how are you going to cover your health care ... a two year full retirement age ... or sixty five and ...\nHow are you going to spend on your savings in order to get to that a lot of people don't realize that is a big difference not earning let's say you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year as a couple of\nNot earning a hundred thousand dollars a year as a couple of between ages ... let's just say sixty and Seventy that's a that's a million dollars let's say if it's just between sixty two in sixty six that's still four hundred thousand dollars that you didn't earn that you may have had to spend\nUm that's a ... that could be a huge difference maker in in whether or not you're living your ideal retirement life are just eating out a retirement life\nRight and even are you still working because if you were still working you're getting and they can now you're still putting into this as a security but that also does have a ratification on how much have yourself a security as tax\nThat is true as well and if you're working before age sixty six or ... or your full retirement age which ever it is\nA once you start making a little over Fifteen thousand a year they start withholding some of your Social Security benefits\nAnd and I'm going to say that more often than not the it depends answer on if you're working and you're still want to claim Social Security it's better to claim Social Security after your full retirement age so that you can keep it all ... you don't have to give some of it back because the IRS or an Irish the Social Security department\nDoesn't just hand you the lump sum that they've withheld they just increase the amount you get over the rest of what they consider your lifetime might be so [noise]\nUh you know if you have to take Social Security early be very careful on understanding the consequences of that and how much they're going to withhold and how you'll get that money back\nBecause that is money that isn't you are entitled to you put into the system and you should be able to get back so\nAgain it's one of those mathematical things do the math figure out what makes sense to you and figure out what your lifestyle dictates\nBuying you mentioned a married couple said there are a couple of other strategies that a married couple can use that ... that a single person doesn't had as far as taking that spousal benefits now too that were really nice to married couples that that had been gone for the last couple of years that Ireland suspending restricted application\nOh she got to tell everybody what they can't have owned by that\nStill some people think that that still and play that there is that that spouse will benefit can actually be beneficial if when one spouse should take their their Social Security even taking it early and then getting that has ... half of the husbands later on when he starts taking his so\nYou have to be a certain age so that's why things coming for the Social Security ... will tell you if you're in that ballpark where you can take advantage of that loophole I wouldn't call it a loophole would just take advantage of the the way the law is you know I I hate St loophole because it's not like we're cheating anything we're just seeing adage of of the rules\nAnd then there's other benefits rather Saturday he won't are single and and divorced or you have an ax so they're allowing benefit it all depends on your situation\nRight so remember even if you don't have your own benefit or your own benefit isn't that much you can take half of your ... up to half of your spouse's benefit or up to half of an ex spouses benefit that may benefit you and uh the way the widow benefit\nWorks um is you can take that as early as age sixty if your spouse's pre deceased do and would have been at the age they could've taken Social Security\nUm when it comes to income planting keep in mind that not all of us die in the same year right as a as a couple of right and if one of us out lives the other by a significant amount of years uh consider the will benefit the widow or the survivor gets the better of the two benefits\nAs what may be smart for one of the spouses to wait especially the ... sometimes even the most unhealthy spouse to wait so that the healthier surviving spouse that may outlive the other one uh would get a higher benefits for longer amount of years so a lot of things that are\nWe talking about that it gets a little confusing too much spouse this house\nThat well that's probably the things that come into play that or the I guess probably the more confusing elements that people need to iron out is how to make sure that we work it out with our spouses are surviving spouses of some of the things that are\nKind of the unknowns but really need to be included in a plan and you need to plan for the contingencies the what ifs I mean that's that's really what retirement planning is nothing is certain nobody has a crystal ball you don't have your desk date you don't have your purse or your death certificate in your hand yet\nHow do you know how you're going to live and what you're going to need so a lot of big questions now the last um besides um Social Security we've got that health care question\nRight and and the and the two guys town together because if you do plan are are wanting to retire earlier say at sixty two how are you going to fill that gap between I'm sixty two and getting Medicare\n[noise] well that's the big question as yeah are you going to go on a cobra plan which is typically a lot more than your employer was paying for your health insurance spend more on me that only lasts for eight months the most you can get it uh so you're going to have to go out on the open market get healthcare hopefully you can qualify for a good plan if you can't then of course you take what you can get\nAnd uh and pay out of pocket so keep in mind that that's going to be an extra drain on your budget for those uh those years also we want when I mentioned about Medicare Medicare requires you to sign up whether you're working or not\nAt sixty five give or take three months for part a give or take us at eight months for ... something like that um depending on your situation or you may or may not have to apply for part B as well\nBut if you don't apply for Medicare during the window that you're supposed to apply it goes up by ten percent on the Medicare be part it goes up tenure penalize your penalize ten percent in premiums for every year and he left\nAnd right and that is for the rest of your life\nRight you can't go back and say All right I did my time I paid my penalty now when can I go back on the regular rate and so they want you to start paying into those Medicare premiums because our premiums for Medicare they're not very high there are subsidized greatly by the Medicare trust which is nice\nAnd the other thing I wanted to mention about that is that if you were working and sixty five and if you do um and you want to go in and register for a\nMedical ... has said her name because it is free if you have an eight and H Sai health savings account be careful 'cause once you do that then you're not able to contribute to your age I say anymore so it's still looking into that in finding out from your situation what's the best way and and how to go about looking\nAt the NATO here so loaded up that each essay updates sixty five in my opinion just get it off though to\nHey I think that's a great way to start making and account for long term care if you start saving now and putting as much money as you can in that age say it goes in tax deferred it comes out tax deferred and that can be your nice little a bucket if you will for long term\nCare ends up being tax free you can even buy insurance your long term care insurance premiums will be paid at the age of say not just your care once you get there so\nAh depending on how you want to pay that um those are some options but don't overlook a healthcare especially if you're planning on retiring early um who's going to cover those costs I mean we can't to foot the bill is alone on those expensive medical expenses we do need insurance in Medicare\nDoesn't cover long term care medical doesn't cover a lot of those expenses that was my next\nPoint so anyway a lot of things to think about are you ready to retire\nMore so are you ready to stay retired or in a position to stay retired regardless of what might come along your way for that five point retirement readiness plan can find out if you have enough income coming in and out if your investments support that income make sure you're saving as much in taxes as you can possibly save\nOr make sure that that health care all those healthcare contingencies recovered and make sure your state plan as an order those are the five points of our\nRetirement radius review normally gay should just come in let's get to know each other find out if there's some doubts we can help you feel we'd love to be of service you love to meet you would love to talk\nIt was in South Carolina they let the winters remain anonymous so what could you do with the money well you could probably by the Tampa Bay rays baseball team that's worth about\nA nine hundred million but none of taxes you can only about half the team so no outfielders for you forget about the Yankees they're worth four billion dollars\nYou could um by half of the islands and the British Virgin islands because of the total GDP of the British Virgin islands is about nine hundred million dollars so here seriously what you ought to do if you win the lottery first number one\nTell nobody that you want not even your spouse I especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know\nAnd that's really scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also total strangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that\nTicket and keep it somewhere safe like bank safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know a secret police from my house no antibiotics it deposit box do not sign the ticket not yeah\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state\nAttorney someone who is expert and experienced in dealing with wealthy families because guess what you're not willfully and left the lawyer tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it and your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an L. O. C. limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice or you need a lawyer he needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you've got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy I mean how can a lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million metal taxes in a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start throwing out a lot of money to family and friends and charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug for the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced the end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say on the kid growing up my work every day like always know you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful\nBecause they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know that you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life and not going to change Oh yes it absolutely well you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you want to give them so\nIn addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live easily to Google your address not only strangers but\nCrux might come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to uh extort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the receiver may and have a security detail around your your life is going to change and what did you have never thought possible because you need personal secure and when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute\nHow much money you're going to give your mom you're just netted after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars unless you give them a million bucks you ...\nCome on you're going to give her ten million\nJust got to know how much given your mom\nHow much you've given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that's a hundred million dollars I guess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars\nBecause when you give away a hundred million dollars you know my friend knock them you\nHave to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nWhich means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars\nSo about four hundred and Ninety two that you you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three fifty\nWe haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point in my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery requires a massive change and lifestyle massive calculation and preparation and planning\nBecause your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them and whatever you do for them ain't got to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying a lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars was won the lottery of course pass performances notification of future results and these are some of the country as a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery\nBecause as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this for one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one so I'm\nSo glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you win the lottery on Tuesday\nYou saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday\nAnd you did notice that they're not only did it get you got a little\nPoorer because of the stock market's performance and we're going to talk about the stock market\nAnd what it means for your investments and what you should do about your investment strategy as a result of the new volatility that we're experiencing in the stock market and the bond market and the real estate market and the gold market\nAnd I'm going to tell you all about it when we come back here on the record all the show triple a plan wreck\nBut maybe

T. dot com primary retirement planning and wealth management [noise]\nGraduate professors that you um UC are very knowledgeable they work in the industry because I got a degree from you and you see I got promotions that helped me move up in the world and earn more from my family [noise]\nThirty year degree on line from her\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the elements show we invite you to send your questions by audio and that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Greg at ... dot com\nIraq this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for both is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stop investment since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks faced this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even if I encourage massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much an interesting not only pay one or two or three percent puts so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could\nSo traditionally we would argue don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but let me turn that inside out and give you\nA different reason why you might want to consider a riskier\nInvestment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago put the money to bill's calling today\nBut think about this when you die who gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast you and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids\nYou could argue that that money really isn't yours it's theirs and you are merely the steward of that money\nYou're the custodian your to the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind meaning that if your\nSon or daughter had the million dollars they would invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that none of taxes and inflation is growing and real economic\nTerms therefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age\nBut based on bears and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you know we want\nSure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk we're jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the farm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic\nLook at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources and design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George

programs out there that are as\nA thorough and really a comprehensive as a Social Security by so I'm not going to dog on Social Security at all now they know it's a great great place to start because there's so many good things about it\nAnd we're going to delve into a lot of those things a little bit more in detail um throughout and show to end tricks yeah I'm going to talk about tips injury but I I like this little story about you know how the Social Security I'll start it and the very first Social Security check was given to mess I may fuller\nAnd Nineteen thirty while is that it was designed or created by um President Theodore Roosevelt in Nineteen thirty five and she was the very first recipient and the Social Security check what I find most interesting now is that at that time in Nineteen thirty five people were expected to lift\nAged sixty three\nNow the kicker is that the program was available for benefits at the age of sixty five so at that point in time it was a pretty look it is well ran that not to go out of money you know now what were they were they take their benefits\nI don't know that it was a ... that's our you know that half the people are going to live and then it was geared to pick up costs for those half of people don't even mind this is on the heels of the great depression right where parents and grandparents had to move back in with their kids and they weren't working anymore and it was\nYou know not easy to\nWhy we can't find jobs for grandpa Joe at AT and then there were older people that that had some difficult times I think it was a great way to make sure that\nIf you are retired and if you weren't able to move in with your children are have all the means you know that you needed met\nThat the elderly those people that are given so much of their life to create the America we live in what at least be taken care of not to have to move in under a bridge you know ...\nAnd it was not meant ever to be a replacement or a retirement plan ranch and it was expected just to give them enough not to have to ... percent you know it it would it would provide enough to where they would not become homeless and it was not a get rich scheme and again it was only supposed to help\nAbout half the people that retired because actually speaking most of them are we going to be done before sixty three or at least half of them\nSo bottom line is things have changed [laughter] there's a little stressed all these years\nA lot has changed in eighty three\nWell and you you were about to mention the what's life expectancy now\nI'm now ... expects mid eighties\nYeah many he said well according to census guarantee when you do are optimize or it will put a female at eighty five eighty six and mail at eighty to eighty three so but we do know people are living way past that into their late nineties and even some into their early ...\nForty percent or you have a forty percent chance if you reach age sixty five you have a forty percent chance of hitting Ninety according to the last steps we did on the longevity show a few\nWeeks ago [noise] so yeah man what do you what do you do um well\nLet's talk about do we have time to get into our first subject was just going to finish rented out the ... and I do I want to I'm going to just ... it may maybe I Want to just kept a a couple of extra things there's a couple of 'em\nAre misconceptions out there that and I mentioned that Social Security is safe now some people think well it's one of the brain it's going to go bankrupt right well we still have\nThose Social Security system as is with out changes was going to go to at least two thousand and thirty four we also had good news this years the trust fund broke even it did not depleted was supposed to actually a ... more than ... supposed to break even and start depleting as of this year [noise]\nAh well two thousand and Seventeen numbers came out but in two thousand Seventeen the trust one still grew by a little over twenty billion dollars which is pretty nice\nUm that means we're still making our own we're still keeping that trust fund or even or better and that statistic that it would go broke by two thousand I'm thirty three a few years ago is now two thousand and thirty four and may be extended so\nThe fact that the economy is better and more people are working where people are paying into Social Security they've raised the limit on income that Social Security taxes are paid on and a little bit as helping a little bit I think with a few weeks we shouldn't worry about Social Security becoming bankrupt I think the government smart enough I Hope so [laughter]\nGovernment coming right out and make some tweaks I mean they they don't have to make big tweaks I mean even if without tweaks it's going to be funded at Seventy five percent or better going forward\nWhich means there's about a quarter of our Social Security paychecks maybe integrity in about Fifteen Years or so uh that's a lot of time to get it fixed and I sure hope they do and I'm certainly willing to pay a little bit more if everybody else will now that my kids can have Social Security I mean they should get

always happy when I'm here with you talking about important things to help people live their ideal retirement life in this time in this next few minutes we're going to talk about purchasing power\n... well I think\nInflation has an effect on purchasing power anyway but with Social Security there's kind of a curious thing that happens\nI'm with it now one of the cool things about Social Security is it has an automatically included cost of living adjustment which\nOver the last forty years is average four percent now that my all sound good and great to\nHave you ever forty years yeah yeah ... we\nRemember the eighties when ... when a cost of living was a you know sit down in well yes that Thirteen percent in big numbers which have been the last seven or eight\nAnd pretty much maybe a half percent one percent\nWell we've asked some zeroes in there and we've had I think a three and a couple of one some things and the curious thing about Social Security is lately because I Know they're trying to make sure that the press one doesn't get depleted too fast is that one of the things that get was held out of your Social Security check and if you haven't received one yet you'll find this out\nAnd if I had a lot of things that that does\nIs Medicare gets paid from your Social Security check and gets withheld and depending on your income level you may actually pay more for Medicare then the next guy in fact there for two years to Medicare depending on your income level so depending where that is that it's going to be taken out of your Social Security interestingly\nThey raise or they have been raising Medicare premiums\nLately about the same amount as they've been raising the cost of living adjustment yeah so it's kind of watch so when you plan for retirement if you think there is really going to be an inflation factor put onto your Social Security\nI Would just kind of consider that a null and void kick that whole idea of the curve for now and just say you know what I'm just happy to get a paycheck that I can count on I'm going to make the best of it and I'm going to hopefully be in a position to supplement with other planning and other means\nAnd that's very you know my favorite topic is supplementing that with your own um income planned with annuity\nWe love we love those for income gaps you know you've got the as we mentioned earlier we've got that the\nThe pay checks that you need the first paycheck that you should really try to maximize if you especially whether you have a pension or not is that Social Security because there are so many different tips in tricks and rules and regulations surrounding it um you know bad decisions could actually cut you off some of the ... the benefits that you're entitled to in fact\nThere was a recent article by forms that said that\nUh because of bad decisions or bad planning ten billion dollars in Social Security benefits are going on claimed every\nSingle you said every single year I Want to say every stinking here but I you know every year ten billion dollars of unclean but that's because people don't know they can claim it or don't realize that they have a right to it and that's why it's important to talk to an advisor that has a little bit of experience with uh\n[noise] at least a little bit of experience with Social Security and also the resources like we do to make calls to the higher power so to speak that no Social Security much better than we do if there's ever a hard question to make sure you get what's yours and keep what's yours I mean you've paid into the system you might as well get what you're getting out of\nLike what five hundred and forty seven different ways to claim years tells a security benefit as well is there is over two thousand rules\nYeah it's uh it's amazing if in fact when we do our um Social Security review on our software it'll say that is going through like twenty thousand different scenarios based on all those different choices and rules and a spouse choosing at this time that time or whatever by the time the computer which I'm so glad they're fast with our we couldn't come up without a conclusion\nAbout one of our clients did she oh my gosh I was so impressed with her she on every restaurant a spreadsheet she had written that how yeah she did every scenario\nEvery age every month and for her and her has banned ads and I still kind of like wow I I just plug it into the computer and all that I thought why didn't press\nSays understanding how the benefits do take at ... and then the benefits\nWhich means the claim it can go down there and ask the right question and as long as the person at the desk understands what question they're asking they should get an answer that will help them make the decision that's right for them not\nGoing to give any more explanation or they're told ... different option I've had to take this as beneficial\nUm the last few words of that sentence and that description in their\nHand book or in their in their training book is but do not give advice says but do not give it by so they're not supposed to give advice it's sad to know though that a lot of people do go down there and give advice and I I ... I had an experience recently where a person came in and they decided to go back to work and um\nThey couldn't turn off their Social Security benefits but if they work and have a certain amount of income\n[noise] um they they they have withheld and they they said well I thought it was flexible when I went down there I told the guy I thought I wanted to wait till my full retirement age and he goes\nWell what the heck it's only this much less and you get an extra few paychecks and so he did but now he's in a position where\nHe doesn't want the extra taxes he doesn't want the Social Security wants to put her on hold and he can't undo it because he took it before full retirement age now the reason we call full retirement age the magic ... just because after full retirement age you Kansas fan and you can have a little bit more flexibility\nAnd so that was something that he just got bad advice on either because he didn't ask the right question or the person\nDidn't take into consideration all the life contingencies that my\nAnd to this person is life and that you know we can't expect them to give us advice down there that they don't know is there just there to answer questions\nThat they can get a little deadline that specially for the amount of time that you just sit and wait\nWell yeah but when he's on the lookout [laughter] maybe they had to give you the book to read you know how to how to claim your best benefit [noise] ... ... you're right but I think the\nI I Would say more bad decisions are made just like getting up by expecting that the answers down there at the Social Security office or the final answer are the only answer without people going out and getting adequate help now I Would also say that be careful and be wary of what you find on the Internet a lot of his allow\nIt and I they on their side a lot of it is so misleading and then followed jar again and it is a very complicated when there's understand that they're saying on their website\nAnd there's even when I'm not talking about the Social Security website necessarily I'm just talking about a ... you know one comes to mind are well I don't know if I throw anybody under the bus but it's a [noise] a well known financial guru that does advice and talks about you know\nAll these things that are\nOld news that basically oh so and so left this much money on the table well guess what they did or are they did away with the spousal\nI'm listening to science and a strategy which could have put anywhere from forty to eighty thousand dollars or so\nInto the pocket of a couple retiring given their ages at a certain time in in a perfect scenario but anywhere between zero and eighty thousand dollars is still a lot of extra money right yeah well they're still counting that that's available and it's been gone for a guy years so terrible is is be careful on that information make sure it's highly\nYeah the ... and the life out there listening in your sixties I mean for me um December thirty first two thousand and it's cool man you're allergic to that status since gone away\nNow there is a grandfather clause that still exists for anybody who is sixty by that same day\nFor a decade application waste land mine spouse tends a full retirement age taking their that might just seconds assed chance for retirement age than they can\nTake a half as the\nSpouses standing as Don still let airs glass so why only one person can lead it kind of just yeah but it but it's not as robust and was it used to be where\nBoth spouses could or they can on both of them want to take the train sixty two in sixty six in the other could take a between sixty six and seven eight and they could both end up letting their their benefits dry it was a great plan and it worked for many and some people actually calculated\nThat to be in their planning or unfortunately disappointed now that they can't use it so again or where do you get the good advice you know I I Would say there's there's one I'm going out I'm\nI'm In a town or ... or I'm learning now because like I say Henry but no I Know that's a in a market which says that it's a different guy [noise]\nUm Lawrence caught the cough is a guy that ah we actually use in in and have access to his team of advisors that no Social Security inside when in doubt [noise] one of the recent books he wrote was get what's yours\nOr one of the examples in that book as is actually a client I I had a chance to call 'em he calls easy lives it's called Larry when we're paying their money and then you get your ass or a lottery or is it anyway so you know Larry yeah you always calls me if he calls me back and he doesn't anymore now he has his assistance to it because he's too big\nTo to begin got too many people like me calling him now but a few years ago I called Boston University where he worked I left my message I said hey I got a guy down here he took he went down to Social Security and they told them so basically bad answers\nAnd he says will give me their phone call and they don't fix it also um I mean he's he's got a lot of clout and he writes books but uh if you ever um want to find good information about Social Security and timely stuff [noise] um he's probably the resource I Would go to and and he is the resource and the team that would that we uh we pay money to every year in order to have\nAnswers to our hard questions [noise] but um\nIt it's good to get an advisor that isn't restricted on the help that they can give and that's one of the reasons that we are for new series and we believe that Social Security planning is a critical part of a comprehensive retirement plan\nYou can't really do it without knowing what your options are on Social Security maximizing that income and filling in the gas around with your other savings and income\nAnd if we don't know the answer we leave effectively find the answer I mean first came into the side and there's like you said five hundred forty cents for a\nWhile the older I get I realize now that I Am older I thought when I was a kid [noise] I guess when\nA when I was just yet I thought when I got older I Would get smarter but what I found is when you get older you realize how smart you really aren't and yet because the more you learn the more you realize you don't know it was an older and wiser for a reason so we are older and wiser and we have the resources to ah make a comprehensive plan a comprehensive\nAnd make sure you're getting the best picture as Larry ... let's say\nYou're getting what's yours what you've paid into and what you deserve in Social Security round that out with a comprehensive plan and you know what it's really fun to come down to visit us we've got drinks and food for you\nMake a visit a very nice time to get to know you a little bit find out what your goals are and if there's a way we can help yeah we share that with you if you want to pursue it any further than that that is totally up to you there is no obligation for coming and visiting us we'd love to meet you love to answer your questions and if we could send you away from our office better than when you came in that in the world is a better place and we've had a good\nDay and we hope you have to so we hope you enjoy the program today we hope you give us a call and let us know how Social Security and other financial or\nHow we can make Social Security maximize sitting every time I met her phone number is five to oh to one's seven [noise]\nEighty five sixty six five to one Seventy five so you say [noise]\nOf an antiquated retail mutual funds they generally you know you don't want us to pay commissions to buy them there are very low expenses there's also generally very low turnover which means the annual tax liability is very low\nAnd each he asked we believe simply offer a better alternative in many cases for many investors and as evidence of this I mean I you know I've been promoting in town of ... I don't know what Fifteen Years\nAnd we are in fact finding that back in oh wait there was a half a trillion\nInvested in each yeah that was you know ten years ago today it's about half a trillion it's three point four trillion dollars that investors have placed into ATF and that is exciting it shows that\nYou're getting the message that's that's really fabulous you're paying attention to diversification you're paying attention to investment cost a and you're staying up to date with the investment opportunities which maybe aren't the same as you grow up with what you were familiar with\nWhat you've accepted the need to adapt and stay current with the market place so I think that's a really very exciting\nOr is it because if we take a look at data\nThat has just come out from a a recent survey back ten years ago to the credit crisis of two thousand eight you know it's great that each yes the sky rocketed in in value from five hundred billion to three point four trillion you know part of that as market appreciation of course but a big part of it is your contributions into ATF as well\nBut not everybody's been\nTaking advantage of that and I'm not just saying that they're not taking advantage of ATF themselves they're not taking advantage of investing at all\nTen years after the crisis we discover according to this latest survey research that twenty seven percent of Americans stopped saving for retirement they stopped contributing\nTo their four one K. entirely they were so spooked by two thousand eight they lost so much money so rapidly\nThat scared them out of the markets apparently for ever twenty seven percent one out of four Americans no longer saving for their future and fourteen percent have continued to save what they're doing so in\nCash oh my goodness so instead of\nWatching their investments triple and values since two thousand nine I mean that's what the stock market has done its tripled in value instead they've been earning less than one percent a year 'cause that's what you know bank accounts have been paying over the last ten years zero point nothing only ten percent of people in the survey said they invest more today than they were\nIn two thousand eight two thirds are saving less today than they were\nAnd almost eighty percent say they can't explain what happened in the financial crisis they don't get it they don't understand what occurred\nAnd so it's no wonder that Seventy eight percent trust Wall Street less than they did in two thousand eight and only forty one percent say they feel\nFully recovered financially in the face of an economic expansion unraveled in American history with the stock market tripling and values since its depths of two thousand nine\nThe majority of Americans still say that they earn behind where they were ten years ago and you know what the biggest crisis is about all of that\nEverybody's ten years older everybody's ten years closer to retirement and that's the big problem and just permeates through out American society regardless of age group according to another survey forty six percent of millennials\nSaid they believed that they need at least a thousand dollars to start investing Seventeen percent say they think they need at least ten thousand dollars\nTo start investing that's simply true anymore due to advanced technology you can invest\nYou can open in account with the dollar not a thousand not ten thousand I'm not suggesting you should necessarily do that before you joined you were trying to plan a worker before you pay off credit card debt or before you Bill cash reserves but the point is it doesn't take a lot of money anymore\nTo build investments and oh by the way a lot of parents are are not saving a lot either it's not just the millennials but the millennials parents that are in saving a lot and you know one big reason for that\nI'm going to tell you when we come back\nHere on the record them and show I'm going to tell you\nWhat it is that parents are spending five hundred billion dollars on every single year and no it's not their kids who are on the playground K. through twelve ... it's not raising children that are the parents are spending a lot of money on\nIt something else and I'm going to tell you what it is when we come back on the program so you can figure it out before we return\nAnd we're going to tackle that in a whole lot of other fascinating information including the latest investment opportunities you probably always wished you could get a piece of but never had the opportunity to

parents are spending five hundred billion dollars a year which is preventing\nThem from saving and investing\nGuess what they're spending that money on cording to a new study by age wave parents are spending five hundred billion dollars a year\nUnder Eighteen to thirty four year old children\nThey're spending on their adult kids twice as much as what they're contributing to their retirement accounts two thirds of parents say they have to sacrifice their own financial security for the sake of their children who were in their twenties and thirties\nSeventy three percent say that they factor their finances into the decision of becoming a parent in the Nineteen eighties only thirty three percent of people in their twenties and thirties did that the average cost of raising a child today is now about a quarter of a million dollars\nNine out of ten parents say they're surprised at how much money they spent\nBy becoming a parent\nAnd nearly two thirds say they encounter financial difficulties associated with parents and even children who are living independently are receiving financial support from their parents parents are contributing to school costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you believe the process here in the Senate was a sham\nAnd you believe Americans deserve better vote if you believe\nThe biggest music festival last year and

at rosy on the house dot com\nThat already has that power you know when you were in the quality business you said before I mean he didn't just pick up all kinds of books and try to read and educate yourself because you had a job a fulltime job [laughter] you know um if you if you have a job and you're doing something else you can't be a master of all ... you can't be a Jack of all trades or you will be a manager of non\n... and that's why we focus on poverty is a financial planning for those people that are getting ready to retire or are already retired and that's that's really the niche focus\nSo and that's the primary cracks that that they seek out professional advice that they have that plan that financial plan that retirement plan on and we've talked so many times about the importance of having that plan\nWell you know it's it's it's no secret that the earlier you start with a plan the smarter decision that is so many people wait until the last minute and then decided to put that or they just think the plan is going to happen by itself because they accumulate\nA certain number of dollars on it it is but a lot of people say well I don't know I don't know who's managing my four oh one K. all I Know that I have to put in a regularly and somehow when I retire I'll have a magic number in there that will have to you know create some lifetime income from\nAnd [noise] I guess that's better than not at least they've saved at least they buy something and that is a plan at least the plan is to save it accumulates but along the way there's a lot more things that will get into a throughout the show today\nThat we'll talk about how how people that are wealthy and you don't have to not just the ... not just the super wealthy but just to the average you know well off some people might call them rich you know millionaire next door that has enough to retire on and live comfortably\nI might have back up on that plan I mean we talked about it before having a vision for your retirement and that's not just the financial side of it it's the ... days weeks months years in retirement\nAnd if you're wanting to travel and if you're wanting to start a new business does have to be wrapped into that financial plan exactly we have to have your bucket list right right yeah and that plan includes tax mitigation or how your taxes are going to look in their future\nUm strategies for with drying out of your retirement income strategies right so and having an estate plan what do you want to have happened to your many after you're gone and if you don't plan that in your retirement plan could you be costing your family members and necessary tax liability oh wow\nAnd we're going to talk about that more later but you know the the thing that um I think people forget about the estate plan as they think this tape plan only deals with when both husband and wife are gone but the estate plan also has to have some sort of a succession are so survivorship planet for a spouse or loved ones because\nNot all of us live to Ninety and die in the same day you know we ... my father died before he was sixty and mom is still alive Seventeen late late Seventeen years later you know found somebody new to marry and now they're you know going through their retirement but\nUh yeah they didn't really have a plan they didn't really plan on one of them dying early in my mom was literally the hanging of I've showed that story of you know in in part several times but\nYou know having a state plan is not what happens you know when you're Ninety it it it takes care of you know powers with money or whether a trust what if when he dies early is their replacement of income and those and those sort of thing so by the way you when you were going through that list of um [noise]\nThose things that you need in a plant let's not forget Social Security again\nThat's a big part of it well income streams and\nNo\nBills don't stop just because you retire just always a good thing [laughter] you still need those paychecks and the six Social Security is one of those paychecks replaces unfortunately a small but very significant part of retirement income for most people so we talked about taxes generating income um what what about inflation\nRight you have to plan gets that cause even three percent may not sound that much at three percent over twenty Thirty years and you retire and they can take a huge bite out of your retirement\nAnd I hope it doesn't keep growing at three percent which is like the last forty your average or so I Hope we can keep inflation a little bit more intact but um you know that does have the ... going to play in the other thing that has to take into consideration is\nUm you know when you're going to need to use that money in your retirement when you get that bucket list are you going to do a lot of traveling expensive things earlier on during your go go years are you going to need more money you know later on for health care

using a professional to give advice and by the way to get an advisor that gives you value\nSome advisors just charge you a fee for parking your money\nWell and that's where even if you have a plan it's there's value in getting a second opinion\nCertainly and also they have those are the comprehensive nature of a plan all the different areas those pillars of of a practical planning or a prudent planning need to be in place and the only to duck tale together and that's why a good experience financial advisor is smart and that's why smart rich people\nUse a financial advisor if you'd like to

stay retired it's your money with Jeff ... from from your retirement planning and wealth management starts out\nWalking back it's your money I'm Jeff slogans president ... retirement planning a wealth management with my co hosts Linda ... we're talking about the seven strategies that ultra rich people use\nTo minimize everything from taxes and maximize returns on investments minimize risk seven things that they do to create an ideal retirement that you can do to\nSo welcome back Linda welcome back to you know I think before we move onto the managing risk can we just let's just kept on taxes a little bit yeah that's such an important one\nYou know ... salmon just licking their ... that well there is chops his Uncle Sam to us the government the IRS is going to get some of your money if you don't plan right um they can't wait to retire because that's when they get the biggest whack at your retirement you know\nSo many people don't realize they're in a higher tax bracket when they retire than when they're working they put all this money away in a different basis and get a tax write off\nMaybe off their income taxes they might be in a load in mid range tax bracket then they retire and in a high tax bracket that's when they get to take the money out and they have to take the money out\nThat way is that why is that because everybody assumes they're going to have a lower tax bracket when they retire because they're not working\nBut not smart people who save regularly who take advantage of upside to the market who protect against risk and you actually enjoy a nice retirement uh from from their retirement\nOr people who who are more info are not necessarily smarter but more informed about what can happen when you do retire with your tax brackets\nWill I think more information is more yeah I don't know interchange informing now are so let's talk about just really quickly about the attacks buckets and the way money is actually the main thing is in order to be informed and make those better tax decisions let's just understand how tax diversification plays out\nThere's assets that are taxed always tax later tax rarely are not at all and there are some a patch traps in all of those that we need to watch out for the tax to always or what brokerage accounts checking a savings account if you're making any interest on those anymore yeah and then you pay tax on dividends interest and capital gains\nA tax later\nWhat are you get taxed later on for one case Iranian things which\nAre down ... which is that's where the cracks than it is because you don't know what that tax rate is going to be twenty ten Fifteen Twenty years down the road\nWe know what it's going to be now and we also know that at age seven and a half and everybody knows their age I Hope so you know how long it's going to be before you are forced to take those required minimum distributions they started out just under four percent of your account value but the ...\nYou're talking about two thirds more money\nThan if you took it at age sixty two but here's the ... the big question is do I have enough money to bridge that gap right am I going to keep working do I have to use on my social or do I have to use on my investments up maybe that's not a bad thing or maybe it's a good thing depending on the matter\nThere maybe some other strategies that you might be able to capitalize on if you were married divorced and we can you know when you come in and we can talk a little bit more about your particular situation\nRight and I think instead of belaboring all the different techniques here let's just a you know offer that you know as a\nYou know something that you can do is cause for that five point I'm Social Security analysis to find out when the optimum time is to claim or benefits how to coordinate claiming benefits with your spouse how you could eliminate or pay fewer taxes on the benefits that is by controlling what's on your tax return by tax writers we've already talked about\nAnd then um how to get a boy how to avoid also getting gouged by the Medicare premiums remember all those four different levels of premiums\nAnd also if you're eligible for other benefits there's over five hundred ways you can choose to take Social Security\nAnd uh you may not even know some of them exist we have some really close off where they'll uncover some of those so if you'd like to come in for that five point Social Security ... analysis a give us a call in fact I think for the first time cause we should do it um I have a free one yeah okay [noise]\nSo for the first time caller she want to Social Security now says to find out when your optimum time has to take that or give us a call you know what we should let's add something we risk ally so that share we just talked about risk\nWhy aren't you know\nFive point we want people come and just for a review but some of these other services are pretty cool the risk allies will actually look at your a total portfolio find out how much risk you're taking compared to how much risk in your mind you should be taking rise you're going to know your risk tolerance and there's a little quick Lincoln do\nYou think versus reality and\nThen you'll find out how diversified or how that risk number really works and how much you might be susceptible to losing the next market correction so um yeah I think that risk allies is really cool things will come in for a ... test as well and find out if you're taking too much risk and I can protect the money from the next market\nAnd isn't it that tell on that that when it that is something that you're interested in and we would need joy statement span your accounts as well as for the Social Security would need to bring in white your numbers are at sixty two six your full retirement age\nOf ... and we can't do without some day so and and we'll send you a little email and remind her call and get your updated on what you need to bring in but um yeah do do be prepared to bring the information needed so that we can help you obviously that's a skinny\nIs a major component for the wealthy they take they take that seriously and they really do understand what their options are\nSo the last two that we want to cover the next few minutes is um [noise]\nThey want a is a state planning make sure your state is protected we ... we talked a little bit about memory or on about how estate planning isn't just when both of you were dead\nAnd trying to leave your a state out appropriate and that's it sometimes people think well I just don't want to put everything in a trust I'm fine well what about succession planning for a spouse in case you die early what about making sure your kids or grandkids have college educations you can set trusts up and plans that will create a legacy that you can leave behind\nA wealthy people do that and wealthy people I think live a retirement live with more peace of mind knowing that they have those contingency set up should they pass away early and should they leave a certain amount of assets in the family they want to keep it in the family not let it go disappear through the court system\nOr through probate or through taxes or whatever\nOther things might might habits so\nYou know some of the state planning mistakes and people do is they they they they assume that he will get a lot of prey that's probably the most common one a will is a probate document probate takes over two years in Arizona on average and it can cost according to an AARP study that was done for Twenty years ago it could cost ten percent or more of the state and believe me\nWith four or five hundred dollar an hour legal fees now it can cause a lot more than that well for someone that\nReally you know they talked about do you need it at ... or you don't need a test there are still some things that they can do to avoid probate if they just had that that well as well\nWell and if if you if you have direct succession or if you've done a good job setting up beneficiaries on everything so everything that you have is lined up and goes directly to somebody that also will avoid the ... process and some people think of trust is the only way and they pay thousands of dollars for addressed\nOh we do trust and they don't charge thousands but we have a very efficient way of creating trust for the typical person even even very wealthy people at a much more efficient cost\nBut you may not even need to pay those costs and if you set your state up an estate planning doesn't mean trust it will necessarily it just means leaving your ass as to who you want how you want with the least amount of taxes trouble and trying to get out of probate\nRegardless of if you have a wheel or trust remember to have powers of attorney because you might not just diner sleep you might actually get sick first and need somebody to take care of you have the living well so you can pull the plug if your brain dead or if you're in a persistent vegetative state [noise]\nAnd that leads us to the last big topic [noise]\nUnnecessary fees and expanded fees and expenses and that\nToo many people pay too much in fact a forms that an article a few years ago that showed that the average mutual fund just because of the inefficiencies in the fund itself\nProbably cost the average investor actually they're they're number it was three point six percent it's not just an expense ratio figure it's a three point six percent\nWell is a passive investment like a mutual fund or that cost in reality three point six percent really inefficient way to manage your money or would it be better to pay an advisor right tactical money manager to actually create value\nTry to do timing the market hedging techniques that might actually save you from losing money in the next market crash\nCreate more value during years when there's upside\nAnd it may actually be worth paying a fee for instead of just doing a passive is what the charge a bunch of fees that are hidden anyway rich people know that\nWhat we find most often that people don't really understand what their invest it in and a lot of people don't think they're paying any fees for their four O. one K. their IRAs\nWell because you can't find them anything right so here's everyone\nTo call the one eight hundred number not your broker and that call the one eight hundred number and ask them what are all the different fees and they may tell you the first one is the management fee of one percent\nKeep digging what other ones but other ones and like I said on some of the variables that I looked at 'em for clients one was over six percent on a variable variable annuity right they don't even ... you know even on any ... year investments find out what those fees are by calling the company\nRight you may be finding out that Ted taking money out of a four O. one K. and doing a self directed IRA even with an advisor fee maybe a quarter and you may be getting more value free money that way so keep in mind fees matter\nA one percent are different differential in fees could make a you know my big big difference could make your money last five or ten years longer in retirement just by reducing those fees rich people know that now you know that to\nBack there seven good strategy that you've learned today we hope you are I'm ready to implement those if you need some help\nOr looking over them again in finding out how to put them into your financial plans please give us a call at five to one Seventy five sixty six [noise] and um again with your family has a plan to make sure you are ready to retire or if you already retired that you will stay retired peace of mind [noise] five to ... to one Seventy five so she says she loves to me it was just as\nRight as I said I have had a safe and happy again\nThis is willy Nelson these days we all know people all around us that are having\nSo if you have a diversified portfolio as the Ohio public employees' retirement system does they're projecting seven point two percent a year\nSo we need to keep this in mind for two reasons number one to make sure that your expectations are reasonable and realistic and number two to make sure that you recognize\nThat this is a long term projection and at any given moment this month's performance the last quarter the year to date the past one or three years anything can happen\nIn that short a period Ohio isn't suggesting that that's the rate of return that they're going to hit in twenty Eighteen they're not suggesting that is the return they got in the third quarter of the year or year to date they're saying that over the long term they're\nExpecting targeting an assumption of seven point two percent and oh by the way that's before fees because you know Ohio doesn't\nPay the kinds of fees that retail investors had 'cause you don't have a hundred billion to invest and we all know that people will invest a hundred billion don't pay the costs that retail investors who have one million or one hundred thousand or ten grand et cetera et cetera get my point now let me take another step further\nWhen you are making your investments\nWhich investments is it your assuming are going to perform well because a lot of investors think that the key to generating successful returns is by picking the right\nInvestments in other words they're Thirteen thousand mutual funds out there which one are you going to pick\nWell\nLet's look at it this way according to tip around in twenty twelve this is six years ago there were five hundred and Ninety us stock mutual funds that beat the S. and P. five hundred that year\nOnly five hundred and Ninety out of the thousands of mutual funds that exist only five hundred and Ninety of them be the S. and P. five hundred so I Want to ask you the question do you think you could pick\nThe fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since such a few number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year good for you\nFive hundred Ninety of them in twenty twelve of those five hundred and Ninety Gino how many of them beat the market again the following year in twenty Thirteen\nHundred and forty so of the five hundred and Ninety who did it in twenty twelve only a hundred and forty of 'em did it again the next year and of those hundred and forty how many of them did it again in twenty four team only twenty two\nAnd a twenty two only three of them did it in twenty Fifteen and all of the three only one of them did it in twenty sixteen in other words of the entire universe\nOf Stockton mutual funds over the ... of them that exist over the five year period from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen only on\nThe the us and the five hundred every year for five years in a row one\nOut of thousands sell less you again do you think you can pick the funds that are going to outperform the market\nI don't think so I don't think we can do it in our firm we don't even try instead what we do is provide passive\nInvestment approaches for our clients instead of trying to beat the market we're trying to provide the returns of the market modest fees and taxes and expenses associated with the investing exercise and guess what\nIf you're investing in that kind of a pattern you're not trying to beat the market you're trying not to get beaten\nBy taxes and inflation so that your money is earning a competitive right of return which should be sufficient to enable you to achieve your financial goals and objectives and that's really the point it's not about beating the market it's about achieving your goals think about it this way two thousand eight\nIn two thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred stock index fell thirty six percent\nSo have you picked and above average fond of funds that beat the market instead of losing thirty six maybe you lost thirty two is that like you know any consolation of any kind of [laughter]\nRight I mean we should be feeling really good we didn't lose thirty six percent of our money we only lost thirty two percent of our mind that you see my point meaning the markets and that's the goal that's not you should be trying to accomplish what you should be trying to accomplish\nIs making sure you are long term\nFinancial goals and objectives are met and to that and I'm going to cite a new study that just came out that shows that forty percent of middle class Americans forty percent are facing\nPoverty in retirement [noise]\nForty percent nearly three quarters of American workers say that they are\nGoing to have to work past traditional retirement age because they don't have sufficient money\nSaved and invested so instead of saying the key to my financial future is beating the market wrong the key to your financial future is making sure you have sufficient money saved on a regular basis\nAnd that the money you're saving is earning a competitive return if not\nBuying a lottery ticket and hope you get rich quick\nJoining the latest hot fad getting into what's hot and avoid and what's not that's not the key\nTo achieving your long term financial goals our goal here for you is to make sure you are not among that forty percent of the middle class who's facing poverty\nIn retirement your financial future is much more up to you than it is up to the markets and if you're not sure if you're saving enough if you're not sure whether you're saving in the right way if you're not sure you're saving and investing strategy is designed to get you where you are trying to go\nWell that's why your call us AAA plan wreck we've been doing this for more than Thirty years we've been doing this for tens of thousands of folks all across the country just like

that those people that don't have enough in their\nFinances to retire and this must be a sixteen year old he quote expert I sixty four I'm lost a tremendous amount of money during in the market my husband who passed away\nA had a hedge fund and I'll make a choice to say that I had nothing other than my Social Security and I and again before you the debt\nThat companies should work until there Saturday because they'll be guy there to provide money for their retirement is\nYou know it's not just saying I can recall hearing number one number two the other thing that could be considered in one's life\nOn from their finances is the quality of their lives and many times working can be very exhausting um for people that are stepping day\nAnd um and Seventy five I mean I think that it's an incredibly um thoughtless comment she has made on the show this morning and I'm horrified that he is a great with everything she has to say\nWhy don't we get swept from where Ninety or until we die maybe that's the thing to do\nThat with that you know worried with our finances\nSo I'm Sorry that she saw said but it's not my fault that her husband lost all of his money and the two thousand a credit crisis by investing in hedge funds and it's not my fault but she's now finding herself in retirement with nothing but Social Security\nAnd so when we say that given that situation you really don't have much of a choice but to continue working I I guess all I can say is well maybe the truth hurts\nUm and maybe this is why we need to plan butter and we need to more effectively get professional financial advice before throwing all of her life savings in the hedge funds just in time for the biggest market melt down in our entire lives\nI feel badly for her but I have a feeling that I'm just the messenger reflecting on the severity of her personal situation\nUm but here's another voicemail but I got and this boys you might recall hearing before what's listen\nI'm calling to say that I listen to their work at home and tell us quite a while\nAnd I decided I Would never invest and him or his company he goes on at no cost him about a simple answer that take three minutes he

tire\nRegional seasonal events wettest October ever recorded in Arizona's history and we're only two October Thirteen and like Eisenhower said it's going to make a great for\nA a a wild flower\nSeason comes springtime of headed that it's going to make for a great we'd season of a weed applicators are going to be busy if you don't do anything this weekend maybe get granular pre emergent spread around your yard it's\nGreat well you're probably up painting outside but we are talking painting with the Arizona pay company owner Joe Camel Joe we've talked a hour and I haven't even you know people are probably saying where I might like to jump on that ten year warranty what how would people get older you have\nWe had you on the air power given your phone I haven't had a chance to get it out\nThere ... if you're interested in the free estimate we do all three estimates toss in Phoenix at six o two six for eight three zero seven one in Tucson at five to ... to eight for one seven nine to or Arizona painting company dot com\nAll right we were talking pretty much about the details required for you to give your ten year warranty and the prep in the selection of material and the application techniques and processes but you all have to take it on a new product line\nYeah we're actually I've been doing a lot of work was into your cabinets kitchen cabinets bathroom cabinets and re painting and those and we found you know a lot of people are interested in that because it's an inexpensive way to really improve the look of your kitchen or or bathrooms\nWithout tearing everything out right right without a huge thing we can be in and out of there and a couple of days put everything back together and it's a brand new look for you\nKnow you basically setting up the kitchen is a big giant spray booze yeah it's a big\nBubble essentially a so you know don't expect to be able to cook anything for those days um but uh once it's done it\nIt looks really really really good okay go ahead but I was you know that's one of those jobs that you schedule ahead of you leaving town for ... absolutely yeah and absolutely that would be any interior painting you know if you're smart you try to get out of there as much as again that would be ideal for sure\nSo what's your prep on these cabbage you've got to do an analysis of are the worst repay I mean yeah right\nRight yeah look at the kind of condition of them now is it is it something that we can bring back to life if there are two ... two nectar banged up water saturated underneath to sing yeah exactly\nUm by the prep for most kitchen cabinets is clean scuffed Dusten and then prime on\nThat is going to be your your main prep work that we need to do to get ready for the paint finish at what you're cleaning product you just go in there with a ... sodium phosphate CSP yep try sodium phosphate wipe them down cleanup and just a sponge yeah we just use this ... um\nThat'll knock down a little bit of the sheen and then we ... them up with a little bit of sand paper steel wool just to break down that she and a little bit more um Dusten to get any of that dust finish off because we don't want to paint over top of any right and then finally you can ask can get to the priming and painting portion\nBecause you're trying to take the slick this of the varnish surface off but you're also trying to take up the years of accumulation of finger residue and Greece and and everything else\nOh yeah and that the cabinets above the stove especially clean those well because you want to get all of that grease off before you paint or it could peel\nOkay so that's another service and then you all just reuse the doors and drawer faces that are with the cabinets\nExactly yeah we're not we're not installing new doors or anything like that okay\nAnd and then we've we've really gone into this because they've developed a new paint that we can use that dry is really hard drives like an oil based paint it's really washable and gives that shiny new brilliant look\nBut it's a lot easier to work with than oil based paint which smells and the cleanup is really hard to do really hard yeah really really hard so they've they have a new product now it's a done Edward cells that ... Williams and it's a ah water based al ... euro thing\nSo it's clean up with water a but it gives the look of an oil base and gives you that really durable finish for cabinet\nOf of the ... of the ... the almost ... but that's not\nWell and it's water based white\nWater based al ... euro thing out here than All right so it has the look of an an al Kidd or oil based paint\nBut it's clean up with water does it apply when you're painting one like oil or is it more of an acrylic it applies to just like a normal paint so you know if you want to paint your kitchen cabinets I Would recommend after you've ... you've prime I'm with a extreme bond primer\nYou want to use a really really good primary for this and then use that finished coat and you can apply it with a a phone roller and it will level down and give you that nice smooth finished so this is something\nA homework to do on the road okay\nVery good well Joe and Joe we appreciate your taking time out of your Saturday morning come in and share your wisdom and experience with all the Arizona homeowners are listening this morning again if somebody wanted to get in touch if they were Maricopa Pima County y'all y'all y'all\nService

the information just one email a week it'll tell you what our lineup is for\nThey can't live on even Ninety nine percent of what they're used to living on if they really need that hundred percent and then there's other people that are making a ton of money way more than they need well I mean what's relative to a ton of money or relative a question about that just say they make twice what they need to live on well they can maybe live on fifty percent but if they what you need to find out is what you're living on\nAnd you want to create a lifestyle if you can to maintain that lifestyle in fact\nSome people want to increase it a little bit and so don't plan I think that one of the biggest thou shalt is to determine what is going to cost to live that ideal retirement life\nWell at least and then the entire to maintain what you're used to now granted but that being said\nSpending habits when you have that income coming in spending habits can be very difficult to change so make sure that you know what your budget is going to be in retirement versus um what it is when you're working and some of the the research that we've done show that some people spend a little bit more like you said some people spend a little bit less\nBut one of the um study shows that when you first get into retirement you are going to spend a little bit more money on travel health care pre retirement\nAbout eight percent of your budget after retirement about Nineteen percent utilities is one that I kind of shocked me that utilities are going to go out yeah you stay home or staying why especially when are you doing you're cranking that air conditioned\nOut for those eight hours you used to be working here at home so yeah there's a lot of expenses that actually do go I mean those are the necessities that actually do go up in retirement when you think maybe they'll go down and I think to travel is probably the biggest one if you have a lot of travelling during your working years that's kinda the bucket list thing that you want to get out while you're young and healthy and able to do it during those go go years\nAdvantage I went ahead is ... ... retirees are now really looking into fitness and health and their spending now after retirement about Thirteen percent on ... membership a trainer national chain ours\nSo up amongst all of that and that's you know those are the things that I I guess are more discretionary than say utilities and other stuff but you know one of the things I just wanted a rabbit before we get to the next commandments is\nUm you know when you decide how much you're going to live on\nYou have to decide if your savings is going to generate that much cash flow and we have to look at the type of investments that you're making are going to keep it in a a portfolio of stocks and bonds where the most you can probably take out legitimately of somewhere between two and four percent that's the two and four percent ... percent rule which used to say well as long as you have a\nA pretty good balance of stocks and bonds as long as you don't take up more than four percent of your balance you'll you'll have a good chance would not run out of money that's been debunked by the last decade of to market crashes now do around two percent so if that's the rules and\nYour grade a long time to\nWrite it but if that's the real you're going to go on you need to have a lot more in savings if you want to use annuities alerts and some of those things that we've talked about an or other shows and we may get a chance to talk about the more today but probably not\nBut some of the annuity products that have guaranteed income can pay out its highest five and six percent guaranteed lifetime income which is one of the males will talk about later and you're guaranteed lifetime income not take a pretense right so\nAnd that four percent rule that you were talking about but the sequence of returns especially living into that at air market can be devastating\nRight timing is everything especially when you um are talking about leaving money at risk and one of the first rules of retirement planning well I guess what officials of investing in Warren Buffett's first role is nothing to lose money right now the second ... don't forget the first will lose money\nIf you lose money that's money or you may if you have to spend it while the markets down you're locking losses and that's not good so what about number two that is a the number two commandment is Social Security [noise]\nA lot of people plan on using Social Security is our main focus as retirement income and thou shalt not is now shall not plan to live off of Social Security alone\n... wasn't designed to be a retirement plan of is just to hedge against longevity and it was only designed to cover that forty percent of your retirement extends\nWell that's that's what it was a ... that's what it has amounted to in in general it covers about forty percent of the average person's retirement\nI think it was really meant to just keep somebody from having to move a homeless person to to have him move under a bridge in a cardboard ... it was another recession 'cause that's kind of where the Social Security program came off of a in Roosevelt time when the ... the great depression as they they had to create some sort of a\nA reasonable rate of guarantee that retirees didn't have to move in with their kids or didn't have to become homeless and have some sort of a a a plan to cover the basics but if you want to do some things like live life and have an ideal retirement life you're going to need to cover the rest of it so Social Security is a good basic a good place to start but it is don't make it your primary source\nOr or don't make it your total source of income is probably not going to pan out and then the other thing is is when a spouse dies you lose the lower of the new head of it so you can't count on both of those Social Security payments to continue for your life it does not create lifetime income\nSo again income so it was the first two commandments we've covered so far today ... ... if you want to a a five point retirement income plan and to see if you have enough to live your ideal retirement life\nIf you're ready we would love to have you come in for that retirement readiness review see what you need to do to get there see what you need to get to stay there if you already are there and make some tweaks along the way\nI Love to have you come in for that at a and you just got to have to give us a call\nAt five

I. R. P. as the life insurance retirement plan that is a Seventy seven to go to the Irish code that allows a permanent life insurance policy to give you tax breaks similar to a rough IRA\nWith gross that his principal protected and grows based on indexes and\nCan give you a lifetime income and those are tax free distribution so not only that you get a long term care benefit you get a death benefit\nWhich is also paid out tax free so the loop is a way that you could also divert some of that future tax money into an account where you can take money out as needed tax free rather than be forced upon your taxable so\nMaybe you'd like to pay taxes right now at twelve or Fifteen or twenty percent so that you don't have to pay taxes at twenty five or twenty eight for the rest of your life\nThat's what we mean by good tax planning but you have to start now you can't wait to start later if you need that throw tax plan that's part of a retirement readiness review feel free to give us a call for a top five to ... to one seven eighty five sixty six again that um that is part of our our complete review\nNow we have two more commandments we gotta talk about and you have another thing on taxes\nNow now that is that it's just kind of lead us end to number nine is down you know our health care costs than I think you kind of hit a little bit of that with the law at having and other avenues that there than purchasing a life or at long term care insurance plan\nRight and sometimes you can divert if you want to pay taxes now when some of that retirement nest egg money\nOr end diverted into like the ... uh qualify for that that could supply a long term care benefit\nYou might also want to just set up a nest egg of four rainy day funds to cover that and self insure or if you can generate the cash flow necessarily necessary you can also do a pay as you go long term care insurance plan which I personally don't really like that much but [noise]\nMoving on from that make sure your health care is covered but moving on from that number ten can't be too aggressive or too conservative\nIf your kid aggressive and you can lose your money if you're too conservative you may not make any money\nSo we believe in balance now that doesn't mean we believe in balance that you should have just as much money in bonds as as stocks are just as much money in variable products is a mutual funds if the asset class has risk it's considered aggressive if it doesn't have risk is considered conservative\nThere are some really nice principle protected conservative accounts that can generate on average historically better than five percent a year which is much more than bonds or have been paying are probably going to pay in a while [noise] better than CDs yet still very safe\nUm I think a balance between those conservative investments that actually have higher potential returns\nIs one way to ... to just continue to be balanced without taking too much risk it also gives you a chance when you have that conservative bloc of money set aside it gives you the ability to me to go a little more aggressive with a smaller portion of your money to swing for the fences for when the times are good\nWow we got through all can\nBarely but surely if you want to know if you're keeping those Ten Commandments and if you are going to live your ideal retirement live come in for that retirement readiness review at primary tire of planning mesh what we love to visit with you know ... just a chance to get to know each other and see if you are ready that's five to ...\nTo one Seventy

think you would either because although the stock market has been historically the best performing asset class we also know it's a very volatile asset class remember two thousand eight\nOf course you do and that's the problem is that we don't want to expose ourselves to the possibility of suffering massive losses in a very rapid pace and that's why you only have part\nOf your money in the stock

and Thursday when the Dow fell\nFourteen hundred points this is why you don't place all your money into stocks and it even goes beyond that because what Wednesday and Thursday demonstrated for us with

at one point one of the biggest companies in America and one of the best performing companies in America certainly one of the oldest companies in America\nHas been doing terribly over the past several years the stock was down forty percent over the past year gee it was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this year\nWow really awful so far this year\nGee is still in the U.S and

fabulous and\nBecame the number one performing stock for the week through\nTuesday of this past week I mean this is why you really can't try to decide what's gonna happen next because you're probably going to blow it in fact it wasn't the just the GED one from among the worst two of the very best for the weekend and Tuesday\nIf you look at what's been going on in all of the death filed the top ten percent of all stocks compared to the worst ten percent of all stocks there has been a complete flip flop\nYear to date the three best performing stocks of the U.S and the five hundred were advance micro devices\nA bio med and Netflix they were the three best performing stocks of the year but now as of Wednesday they fell to number three hundred and Ninety three number four hundred and eighty one and number four hundred and forty three respectable\nThey went from being the three best\nShoot for the past week as a through Tuesday among the very worst in the marketplace there has been a complete flip flop\nAs a result of the changing of fortunes as of Wednesday the very best performing stocks have become the very worst and many of the very worst have become among the very best this according to analysis published in the wall Street Journal on Thursday\nSo what we have to recognize is that all of this is fleeting the ability to make an investment decision based on how things have performed in the past well that's just a suckers bat and therefore my message she was very simple number one\nLet's not get overly anxious and fixated on point declines in the Dow Jones industrial average number two this is an argument a reinforcement for why you need to maintain a diversified portfolio based on your goals and objectives and number three to maintain your focus\nOn those goals and objectives if your goals and objectives have not changed if your personal circumstances have not changed\nIf your attitude about risk has not changed than there is absolutely positively no reason for you to be making any change in your investment strategy\nThe fact that the stock market had a lousy day one day this past week is not in and of itself enough of a reason to make a change and the portfolio no I'm not suggesting that we aren't going to see continued volatility in the market my point is very simply\nWe can't draw a conclusion one way or the other nor should we attempt to make a prediction about what's going to happen next instead look at the economic fundamentals unemployment is at the lowest level in this country since Nineteen sixty nine wage growth is at its highest level over the last ten years\nThe economy is still hunting along just fine and on that basis the argument for staying fully invested in a diversified portfolio remains completely\nIntact and so if you're upset about it if you're watching the news and worried about what you're seeing\nStopped watching the news it doesn't mean you should change your investments that means you should change the channel that's the most effective advice I can give you on the show today I Want you to stay with us because if you're still struggling on what you should be doing with your investments I have the number one

right guy doesn't show heading out to Troy in Michigan Paul's on the line how you doing fall\nOn my question is about the option to take a a lump sum a passion briefly I've been given the opportunity to take all your input on it\nSo ah the question is whether you take the lump sum\nA or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter] so that's a yeah it's like they're no reduced though do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vaccine for a lot of folks\nGood news is this it is straight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis versus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to produce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true a radio station our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nThe pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases this year they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where where the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually than a clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions it's a fixed amount\nWhatever they are giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise but the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul\nNo single okay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or a partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nOr so that's a consideration ah that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major one his lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you whereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce that you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often\nSuperior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given the lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my ... so you have to know your salary you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manager permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nAnd you would say the best thing to do is put it in a\nA R a yes or assuming you're eligible and in most cases you argue roll the money over to an IRA and then you begin making withdraws from that account whenever you're ready to start taking it if you want it right away you can start if you don't need it for a while you leave it there until you do need it\nAnd you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income\nFrom an investment strategy you create on your own\nAs I said usually the answer's yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this and detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that with a lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to see which strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good so yeah the good news is like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what yet this way and here's what you get that way which number looks better to you", "show_name": "Edelman Financial Engines", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "13", "locations": [["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Arizona",
