people you put away Knoxville\nUm I could tell you a couple of the cases that\nWere a high profile and then some maybe not\nSo high profile but that isn't humor involved roast born a what's an operation in East Tennessee we had a sheriff's department was providing protection a\nFor ... other gambling prostitution a liquor running and that department was not only\nProviding protection they're also participate uh so I had a\nOne of the agents company as a senior agent and said you know want to do this and one investigate this was going to take time I got to have your support said OK laid out so we initiated it was a long term investigation\nUm we pretty much dismantled the sheriff's department are used in a number of undercover agents funding undercover agents that know about cock fighting um interesting process so\nWe took that down and there's still some repercussions years later I'm another case we worked with Memphis division call Tennessee walls we uh Tennessee had the the best legislature money could buy they were taking bribes uh taken\nRunning computer scams like Chicago pretty much very much so we teamed up with a Memphis division because they have their legislators and we had ours and we start taking them down or the or\nOne of the U.S attorneys at the time was in the Republican Party and he was uncomfortable or so he recused himself because he didn't want to be seen as\nA attacking Democrats are so that had its own legal a loop ramifications we had a a an incident where we had a\nTwo young men want her to start your own of white supremacy group\nSo they recruited another guy and they were talking and they planned on running operation where they would or Rob a bank and then when the cop show up getting a gun fight until the cops and then take the money will the guy they recruited came to\nUs and said you know what I'm good with taking other people's money but I'm not hanging around the shooting eat any cops is that what do you want me to do so we wired him up a gossip conversations at\nWhich in [noise] excuse me um [noise] and we we took this guy's car and where it up as well because they were going to use his car and\nWhen it comes time to go in and robbed the bank they're going to go into a church parking lot\nDress up get your weapons out of the trunk drive and take over the bank will we set up that we knew which banks are going to hit so we had our people inside that bank we under surveillance going on them that day we had our uh FBI air force in their own shots\nAnd what happened was they change plans in the middle of things\nSo they went to a different parking lot and the second one was going to be by our informant if they had the guns on them his hat is bowling camp was going to be building front Bill Bill the ball camp would cover his eyes if they had the guns in the trunk he was going to have the hat on backwards\nAnd so we had our SWAT Team ready ... anytime swat teams use recalled out the head of the office or the assistant special agent in charge has to be on ...\nThat's that's the responsibility it's accountability and uh it it works well but I was on the seat and I have preached to preach and preach to all my agents use your body armor you get it for free where so\nWhat happened was\nWe decided to take these guys down before they make it to the bank because we don't know there's going to be another change their plans or what so as soon as I pulled in the parking lot of the church another church\nWe are surrounded him drove in\nArrested him we're all looking at our informant you had these hat on backwards which meant the guns and the Trump would also installed a kill switch on the engine of his car so that once they got they couldn't get ... they couldn't couldn't go anywhere well that didn't work because we tried to tried to kill switch in the car starts right up\nBut one of the things that happened was I got in there and I left my body armor in my bureau coroner jumping the surveillance car so I'm near with a\nMachine gun and no body armor so at the scene everybody else has body armor and I have a Buick [laughter] I'm hiding behind [laughter] we'll we'll of a\nBureau Buick a and I had to make numerous apologies\nYou're eating crowd [laughter] I Am but you got the bad guys we got the bad guys and what happened to the informant\nUh he ... he was a cooperating witness so ah he didn't want to charge we arrested him to make it look like right you know attack them correct um another\nTale as there was a a bank robbery in South Carolina and we got a tip a call from a guy that said I Know who did the bank robbery it so and so in this world lives will Knoxville division covers to time zones\nAnd this was in the central time zone so\nHow'd the SWAT Team surround this guy's he had a double wide trailer on the side of a mountain\nAnd he was a white supremacist he was rumored to have machine guns in his house this was election day so his kids were home two daughters because the schools were used as a polling place and\nWe didn't know what we really had on the inside but the a SWAT Team I've been there all night it was pouring rain cold mountain range and are willing to go shading and he finally hung up wouldn't negotiate with the negotiators so I said you tell a\nTell this guy that he's got one minute to come out with his hands up or I'm

about getting a\nI think a lot of people you want to understand that because I don't I don't have to tell you where\nThe Mexican law enforcement officers get paid miserable yeah they get peddling peddling famous\nSo the way they survive is through bribes ... that's just the reality we've all heard it you know they they survived through bribes I grew up on the southern border I'm I'm guilty of myself of going down to Mexico when I was younger and at times running a stop sign\nAnd giving the cop there twenty bucks and even he left me alone you know it's just that it's accepted over there\nAnd when you have these many individuals coming through it's an opportunity for a lot of these law enforcement officials to line their pockets\nBecause they know these people are carrying something repairing some kind of money or they connect themselves with some cartel and uh that cartel itself pays their monthly fees to the Mexican ops and mix it with a federalism Mexican\nOfficials and he goes on and off so that's why they don't have any\nReal big push to try to stop because they're making money off and in the end there also realizing that these guys aren't going to stay in Mexico anyway they're just passing through on their way to invade the United states of America\nNow I've heard what's what are we supposed to do how can we do it oh it's too late blah blah blah you hear all just BS\nRight I blame ... the commissioner of the adjust right CBP commissioner I blamed the chief\nThis happened in April Andy it's happening again yeah and there's been no different plan

there are military well I don't know but I mean they're getting paid pretty darn good\nBut you know I saw some social media pages post that were sent to me\nThe commissioner is too busy hanging out at a bank which with foundation's being run by retired chiefs that didn't do as a border patrol agents that would that work anywhere any favors when they weren't chiefs and now all of a sudden they're holier than thou\nAnd then what you do is you do real sanctions on those countries and by real sanctions I mean you close the embassies ... those the embassy in Guatemala El Salvador\nStopped giving their cows let their politicians are governors and everyone else in their family stop giving them these stop stamping their visas to come to the United states and shop\nAnd I know it it sounds weird because additionally it may be a hit on on our economy right because you see all the but it won't be to that level right they'll get the picture and they'll start enforcing their immigration\nAnd at the same time I think some of these invaders will relies instead of invading my country where everything is hunky dory [laughter] right\nThey'll they'll they'll do rise up and put at least half that amount of effort\nTo get rid of their dictatorship rained get rid of their horrible gr because they're not coming with the intention is to assimilate they're not coming with the intention is to become

people paranoia\nBut guys there's no other way to to see it you need to be worried you definitely need to be worried and and if this is some type of BS a election you know diversion whatever you may call it\nThen shame on whoever's causing yeah the national\nBorder patrol council has endorsed the individuals that we think\nAre are the ones that are going to get us across that finish line to get

have no clue so again no what your children are looking at on the Internet you know what their ... to talk to on social media I think it's very important early interventions everything\nIt absolutely is and you can't encourage parents and family members and guardians enough to contact authorities if they see something that they believe in suspicious if there is anything concerning in what they notice with their children's social media accounts it's important to let someone now\nYou know again a a repeat this is if you think there's something inappropriate or even possibly illegal let us know let us take a look at it I mean law enforcement there that's what we do will come in will look at it\nUh we'll talk to your your loved one your your children unless determine if there's something there that we things or just give some advice to the child will spend a few minutes that's what we do we're we're public servants for a reason\nYou know the other thing I Want to hit on his what's going on on the borders was grown our southern borders I I Know in ... county uh thanks to my border team are collaborative efforts with them or do you see his staff and our federal partners we've done some amazing thing to stop the drugs low\nBut what hasn't stopped flowing is the the human smuggling like we're talking about today here uh so far this year we've got a hundred and forty thousand family units so far across the border in United States is you're on top of that another hundred thousand on occupied children\nThat are um now being addressed by our federal government and I'll just be honest with you and this is not a cold day or night on this and a sheriff's\nUh from the national sheriffs association are way down to share ... county myself sheriff Napier and others years on the southern border we're being tasked with this and we're looking for answers because\nThe federal government has tapped out when I mean by tapped out of the fact that as their resources are over extended when it comes to this um they have thirty five thousand ankle bracelets left\nA which is not going to be enough so what do they do or what their what their plan is greyhound buses which is another one that has tapped out because of all the ah family ... family use are coming to our southern border and their take him to their final destination so\nI don't know what the answer is concerned for sheriff's obviously is we got to be a form 'cause we represent communities and in the mix of all this are vulnerable people vulnerable people\nThat's absolutely true and these are the numbers that we know about and the ones that law enforcement or actually intervene on think of the numbers that to get through that we don't know about and those are the ones that are in the really vulnerable populations women and children who come across the borders with a group of others\nAnd once they're here not being in the country and not having the ability to go to law enforcement perhaps if someone is putting them in a situation of being violated in sexual ways or\nOtherwise um they really are vulnerable to becoming victims of crimes and not in a position of having anywhere to go to report it or at least that's the way they feel about it\nAnd you're up you're right we hear that a lot too and uh and and and ... we look at consequences in your office will be consequences for those or break the law there there's a unique situation here with those coming across and um is right now there's over forty five thousand in custody of which is\nOver what they are even allocated so it's it's a huge\nStress pressure onto our federal government and the current system in these immediate attention there's no doubt about it needs to be the attention because in the mix of all this is going to be victims are going to be in your office and I'm going to be at our offices or as we invest it is and these these cases of prosecutions sound easy but\nThey're not as a lot of challenges these prosecutions you talk a little bit about that\nAre challenges and it's because of the vulnerable populations that we deal at a large part of the time you have people who are forced into situations and doing really unspeakable things\nAnd things that they don't want to talk about in order for us to prosecute someone and hold them accountable for this kind of thing you need to have a victim who is going to talk about it and not just come forward and tell law enforcement what's been happening to them\nThat someone who's going to stay involved throughout a prosecution and as I'm sure you know that's not something that takes a month or two that something that takes several months and sometimes a year or more\nAnd to have someone go through that process we're very fortunate in our office and I'm other offices around the state I Know have victim services divisions as well\nThat we have advocates in our office who are dedicated to understanding the needs of sex trafficking victims and to be able to serve that particular part of our population\nSo that we can hope to keep them engaged in services and provide them with the assistance they need to be able to get out of this kind of life\nWell it it's tough because you have a a population that\nHere's government a lot of ways they fear the ability to come forward of\nSome other things some other consequences possibly being deported we've heard that and uh and and I'm all about making sure the laws of war to the fullest when it comes to\nYou know following the pluses legally\nBut I also understand the reality of is you know victims of the victim doesn't matter where they're from we need to make sure we take care of our victims and that those perks that cause the harm to our victims are held accountable but it is a challenge is Ruth challenge when it comes to those to come forward that really want help from law enforcement\nAnd then again these cases don't last overnight to being ticket you pay a fine you move on this these are very complicated cases that are mostly drawn\nThey absolutely are and I think again when you look at what can the community do to try to help 'em victims that are in these situations so many of them don't want to come forward so many of them don't want to trust law enforcement\nUh to begin with and it makes it difficult for us to identify those but there are people in our communities every day who noticed something happening maybe down the street from them\nA inordinate number as cars are traffic or males or see girls are juveniles a young people that are in a certain area and they noticed that traffic perhaps day after day and maybe into we hours in the morning or night and\nThose are things that they can again Paul and report to law enforcement if you see something that you believe\nCould be consistent with sex trafficking or\nWhat you may identify as some sort of prostitution activity it's information you can report to law enforcement and let them investigate give them an opportunity to be able to see what's actually going on it's important to get our communities and fall so we can identify these people who are being victimized in this way\nI a hundred percent agree on that and please I encourage you as a share of and speaking of sheriffs throughout the United states\nCallers call your local law enforcement we're here to help and that's what the bottom line is we're not here to play politics\nNot here to use me where we're here to find that solution for you and in ... and\nReduce and get rid of the harm that's been brought to you so I encourage you that and we have a victim services and throughout the United states most counties have that I Know Pima County you have that he told the last few minutes or what your victim services tales\nOur victim services has trained advocates who not only respond and nine one one type emergencies they respond to virtually all violent crimes hearing Pima County anything having to do with domestic violence and they provide the\nInitial support after someone has suffered some sort of trauma and the sex trafficking area we have someone specifically trained to identify the needs of sex trafficking victims and to be able to\nTalk with them and work with them to make sure that they are matched up with the services that are most needed in that particular moment for massive people and at least trafficking situations it's certainly going to be just finding a place to live\nAnd finding a shelter that's going to be available to them and again our community partners in NGOs that we have here within Pima County\nUm there are some that to a really great job that providing those services are advocates then continue to work with these victims throughout the court process so they can be with them from the very beginning of when the trauma was induced throughout any kind of trial\nWell was great to see that I Know it's\nWhat's what a tray she's talking about is reciprocate in many many counties throughout the United states and cities and and the courage to come forward and you know just a real quick notice them into our last few seconds here is about six thousand dollars are tells charging to bring up a humid across the border\nJust think about that and they can't pay their indebted and to use these criminal cartels so please say something\nYou see some it's not right it probably isn't give us a call list check on there was no fall for calm law enforcement and uh so ... you can tell you a very passionate about what you do not talking to you before the show so thank you so much for coming on the show today and for all your ... barber law for what they do here in the county and\nBeyond and thanks for having us on here again everybody have a safe weekend and please\nDon't mortgage companies have equal housing lender and I'm a less three to seven for jury Harrison animal last Wednesday will succeed find one age is license to do business in the state of

confirmed\nWe use that word and we use another word right\nTo kiss the rear ended up really going to change\n[laughter] right [laughter] anything that they want he will give them\nHe was worried that the bill would have unintended consequences right eh speeds three for nine would have prohibited the civil arrest of anyone\nIn uh California court house while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in that court\n\nLet that sink in a ... it would have ... prohibited it though right so there's the problem every day\nIn every court house in the United states thousands of people are subject to civil\nArrest for violating all manners of laws in court orders\nHad asked these three for nine been signed into law by governor moonbeams brown California would have shot itself in the foot and hobbled both its court systems and many of its own law enforcement agencies\n'cause just anyway somebody showed up for a court trial and they had a warrant then they wouldn't be arrested right oh wow\nSo he so see but the way they push the ... the way they wrote it they thought it was just going to affect illegal aliens mhm but no I was going to go as it was going to\nFall across the board right right and that would have been like disastrous for California\nSo but what's most disturbing is asked me three ... isn't the virtual ... signaling incompetence that led to its veto rather what happened is if the bill hadn't inconvenienced California courts and Ken of for California law enforcement\nGovernor moonbeams he would have signed that law wow and then you know he would have done so knowingly full well that ... you know a sanctuary state legislation the bill was both on constitutional\nAn egregious in an egregious violation of the principles of federalism on which the United states was built\n\nThe habits oh because the people currently running California chair way more about illegals access to courts than they do about the safety of the United states of America and the United states citizen that's what it comes down to what we\nWeren't they also looking at something where there was going to be no more bail depending on the area of the kinds of\nStupid stuff there I mean it's just yeah I don't get it and I don't understand where these politicians come up with this it bothers some um [noise] and we were talking about it earlier ... before we were on the air and you were talking so there's a lot of things that the people don't understand\nIs that is an issue this being one of them ... years and and I'm cool you know I understand that help other people out and and I get that but do you do help others out\nBy sacrificing your own yeah you know what I mean it it's ... it's like gold or Francis Francis down during Texas\nLittle France's maple yeah people call them but he's not really but yeah so so Francis O'Rourke um his big push to be a veto veto veto\nVeto veto there you go [laughter] and it came up with that one [laughter] we didn't do veto being so um yeah he wants to push this whole um\nFree or access of a college tuition of for illegal aliens\nSo realistically even those people that are super far left leaning right than even even though you gotta sit there and be upset\nBecause I Know not everyone can go to school I mean it is what it is right I mean you better yourself and you do stuff and there's grants you can apply for and there's ways you can move forward there's you have options right\nWhen the end you're gonna have to pay in back of course because nothing is free\nBut this guy wants to go ahead and give it free to illegal aliens I think anybody would be a little\nBit of going to college yeah college yeah it's it's absurd that want to go that can't get funding right here that were born here\nOr right it's just I don't get it but here you help here you have you know ... veto veto Francis veto Francis veto and and moonbeams brown and the Bernie Sanders and my personal favorites\nThe man with the stash that won't go away\nOur very own ... also [noise]\nGrow grow and he was a music [noise]\nAnother town politician\nWho is way more interested in illegal aliens\nAnd possible voter base\nThat they would form in the future rather than the citizens of the of our own country in this case being California hardworking taxpaying everyday citizens okay cause I've met some people from Kelly\nIn the Central Park and and they're very very conservative they are not like a lot of people would think there\nYou guys need to vote moonbeams out\nRestore some a semblance of sanity in California in sunny California so quite some time ago and I don't remember the show we had my love that's black belt\nJujitsu ninja he was my ... instructor he moved to Colorado but we also had our very own uh the Tucson pride\nBorder patrol agent ...\nResponses river you\nKnow I'm pretty sure at the time we had him here he had just gotten his purple belt so we're gonna bring them on\nHe's an agent is important people need to know what we're about what we do [noise] and I think it's a fantastic time to be able to come on it's just the rights really fast with response was the man I listening to the green light [noise]\nIf it weren't for the union the American public the people who still respect law and order and the people who still respect this nation would have no information basically a court you guys are very alone you have every force in this country mobilized against you for political reasons\nWhen it's about more than words or pictures when I go to the spot where the border patrol agent was murdered where one was was I Believe lord trapped and killed and so I Walk up to pass that I think that that the agent would have taken and then there's this American flags around his his memorial [noise]\nAnd I go up to this large cross all I'm saying is is do you find her and there's the slap of there's this piece of laminated paper flapping in the wind that you can't see what it says so I'm I'm looking through this you find her and I I look up at the top of the cross and I go back down and when I straighten out this piece of paper\nIt's a picture of him holding his kids is and I'm Sorry [noise]\nIt said um we love you pop you know and that just right there it was just like so real to me when it's about exposing the truth\nAnd getting the story right\nBreitbart Texas\nTexas federal wellness center

W. U. C. dot com [noise]\nAnd now back to the green [noise]\nWe're fact rather ... C I F ... a little bit fatter than I brought us\nInto the show yes you didn't like the whole welcoming to walk out of your bedroom and it was okay it's ... it's October\nHalloween or how about your show you or I was going for that spooky feel yeah you know\nI'm so but as promised I told you guys I Would get a guest on I think it's an awesome yes I'm very excited to have him on\nBut I kind of messed up the beginning in ... in the introduction before the break you never miss I did this time at least at least they said his last name directly to doubt it um\nBut one of the issues that we've had is obviously I I dropped the ball when was the last names but I didn't do it this time\nWhen I dropped the ball and it is I kind of removed his rank a little bit so we had responses river on the show before and I said it was back when he had his purple belt\nBut we've talked during the break and I stand corrected he had his brown belt already ah which is pretty cool um and and ... and ... and I'm Glad I have him on because\nWe we go back on the show and I and I wanted to talk to\nChris and explain what he had been going through and what he's he's done so far within Brazilian jujitsu right and Chris\nAnd I knew what you guys you're this sometimes when you talk about martial artist but I've met a lot of martial artist in my life because I've been involved in different types I've never reached\nThe levels that our guest has reached but I've met a lot of people and not all of them are humble some of them can be ... to be honest\nAnd you know moment may arise\nWhere you have to defend yourself or your family\nAnd it doesn't you don't need to be law enforcement that's what's important right but I Need you to explain these guys the reality of yeah you have done you have weapons\nAnd maybe you won't achieve a black belt maybe you will for baby won't but why is it important that you do trained in something and why specifically and I know what I'm hearing a lot of you\nBut why specifically the ... or anything else\nWill like um like kind of like kind of a reference remained at the beginning\nTo to um to the original USC a that's a fight like we like I mentioned earlier a especially whether it's on during the off duty or\nNine times out of ten or in my experience it's gonna\nEnd up on the ground so I'm not not just for the fact that like to to learn a lot of course it's awesome to stick to stick to it and and learn you know all the all there is to learn the basics but I'm of course\nYou don't want it by use it basically and as far as the law enforcement perspective I'm not going to I'm not going to sit there and want to fight somebody on the ground because I Know I Know uh\nI Know digits a meetings that\nThat ah that defense that I Know to be able to stand up and get back to my feet to\nTo be able to see my surroundings I mean obviously not controlled environment you're like a lot of competition there is not going to be another attack or another assailant it's just you against your own but I'm On the streets for example at the you know you're at the movie theater and you're in the field or whatever um you don't know what else is going to be around so\nUm I always tell are people that the reason I Do it um in in the scenario is that I just talked about is to be able to\nTo know how to for example the skates from me five fall down and somebody ends up on top of me you know you their basic very basic movements that you can apply to get out of them out there shouldn't be able to eventually get your feet to\nYou know three chickens you're carrying are rich or you know whatever you're asked on in the middle seat or whatever you carry but um that's that's kind of way I'm what I'm referring to that does that make sense to what you were asking\nNo it definitely makes sense because I think that's important that people people understand and I know we talked about it when we weren't when we went on you and you had said\nYou know what you learned a couple of months down alone can help you make genetically yeah for\nSure I mean just just to name just a sauna models of a of a a digits who are are like four to six months I always tell some I always tell people especially beginners that I'm forty six months of digits\nWho is like night and day if against somebody that doesn't mind just as you move to the future you stick to it for four to six months and that you as\nIf you find yourself in you know four months back or six months that you would just demolish\nYour your past self and that's kind of a a I mean it's kind of silly\nTo think of it that way but that's kind of ... it really all states\nAnd and you know the basics is are are very basic there's a very basic movements that you can now that you can do to accomplish a\nUh to be able to stand back get back to your seat and apps and the ... over at um like especially I don't know about other stations but at our station um the guys that are actually doing their going now they're kind of blind that stuff um in in our ah use of force thing\nThe only issue is you know you know the lack of participation in the ... the lack of motivation of of a lot of the agents not just and not just that is that once every quarter is is just not enough\nTo be able to dash something yeah that is why are like that\nYeah you know what I mean it's just not enough time to to one hour or whatever it is that they showed the technique that those guys are showing a lotta times are are effective in and very basic but um if you're on the drilling that for thirty minutes or whatever they do sometimes is classes are like Fifteen twenty\nTwenty people know that they use force classes and that's just too many people for how to be able to drill it and then like I like I said the lack of motivation sometimes\nAnd uh it's it's it's not enough uh so I always talk about um how you should at least do something what what anything out like you said like you did karate or whatever or um\nEven like just go and do some cross that or or whatever you know what I mean just act as to where you're not going to be um you're not going to put yourself in a situation where you can't\nEven get your feet NATO\nWas that was that your little shout out to our good friend Ryan is that what you said cross ...\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah what do they hide [laughter] I won't make that amount that we already got out of All right yeah I Love ... uh but yeah it is it's\nFunny you mentioned that when a but no you're right and and I think that's always been my gripe I guess you would say people used to say oh well aren't you know he's bringing the union thing issues complaining about how how the how the um use of force is going but that was my gripe that you got guys that are not really in shape\nOr not that I'm saying that they're out of shape but you know what I mean not I guess they're they're physically not trained or prepared for some of the moves that they may be shown in the use of force when it comes to like the the the defense moves\nThat's one of those things so you go full force at one time and you can get hurt because you don't have the technique down\nAnd and then in the end\nYou're only doing it like once a quarter for Fifteen twenty minutes you're not really going to it's not going to help you what's going to hurt you more than they help you that's why it's important to go find someone and actually do the training\nAnd I think a lot of the times we hear criticized a lot of times is obviously the money issue people say oh well it's kind of expensive I'm not sure well I mean I think your life is is ... ... it is worth more than what you're going to spend\nYeah that's for sure that that's definitely true I mean I'm not a thing a we're talking about teaching classes I can show it has nothing to do with the the use of force training that we that the guys do on a quarterly basis I teach a class over at\nAt at the station now I'm a condition for combat as instructor also\nSo I teach a class that we actually have um three days a week when they when they friday but I teach a weren't we friday class\nAnd those are also available to to uh\nUm agents are and it's part of it or was it called the ... or whatever\nRight workout rancor workout program and you do ...\nAnd those are free you know that doesn't cost anything\nUm and and it's it's it's you know conditioning for combative than we do some you know some striking some round stuff and I'm so there's there's several people several rigors that we have that that take advantage of that but I Wish there was always I always wish there was more\nBut that's what I was to know what what what they have you guys are doing it Chris\nA Monday or Monday Wednesday Fridays on Mondays is a one or the other\nCondition for combat as instructor I'm using the ... got to he does really good or a boxing drills he's a he's more boxing oriented right but he does a lot of a lot of drills I'm\nA with a with a boxing base so those are really good or not the classes are only an hour long about seven to eight um and then Wednesday's mine are in my class and he's uh\nWednesdays is more like um the way I Do my class I kind of try to mix it up and do robots around a little bit of standing at the end they do a little circuit I'm trying to simulate a like a Fifteen minute fight\nMhm ah three three five men around at the end and you start real sort of the you know like maybe like some\nSome bag work some you know some ground and found him a dummy some battle ropes them you know little things like that to just get to get the blood flow in a lot of people that I Know I'm always throwing ride my bike right for the class and and um and\nYou know I I like I even tell them if you want to just come watch you know for five minutes at the end like state can see him\nAnd it's just the people from out you know from all all um experience level as you don't have to have you know like you have to go out drinking it's actually better when you when you're not experience because I like I tell these guys a lot of the guys and gals I'm\nIt's better to\nNot have any experience for us because you don't develop any bad habits kind of right being on the arranging my when when you have all these guys that are shut all these different guns but I'm so they develop bad habits from other weapons or just bad habits from shooting at all it's the same thing with um with this you know we\nAre and then I tell people you you you just go at your own pace you actually need to take a break of eating just stop stop and nobody's going to yell at you nobody nobody's pressuring agree just want you to get your heart rate going in\nAnd develop a little bit of technique nighttime I incorporate a ground stuff on Fridays class it's a it's ... it's really kind of morphed into a or did you get to class I've been doing it since two thousand twelve and and um", "year":

six years ago that number was um four hundred and fifty four so that just kind of gives you a perspective and an idea of how bad it's gotten in the last Eighteen months worth\nTwenty four hundred on those that's pretty remarkable it's about a three hundred percent and yeah\nI wanted to I wanted to go back to uh so how did we get to the deflection idea where to come from and cause a little non standard a lot of people out there will you know think tough love is a better approach or whatever but it is you know I I have to tell you the\nThe issue is so we'd go out to a store it's a win will shop lifted and uh the store security we holding them for us\nAnd we'll go out and we'll talk to that person and in the course of processing the shoplifting arrest wound up doing a search and in their pocket will find say cocaine or heroin or methamphetamine [noise]\nUm and then the only thing that police officers could do at that point the only thing that we were allowed to do until deflection occurred uh a program began in July first\nWas booked him into jail so let me talk to you about what that means because most people aren't booked into jail most people don't know what that means so this is someone who may have a job a likely as a job and now gets a felony\nFast and because of the felony arrest for having the narcotic in their pocket\nThey get booked into jail which means they probably miss work that day they get out of jail very quickly it's not fair held a long time but when they get out of jail now they have appointments that they have to be enough to get a public defender if they don't make enough money or they got to hire an attorney [noise] um and if their work finds out they'll likely be fired from their job\nAnd uh at the end of of everything maybe they do get into drug court six eight nine months later so suddenly now they're getting a treatment opportunity at six months to a year after the arrest\nAnd what we thought about this was three years ago and this is on the national stage we were part of a discussion and said that doesn't work we need to get people treatment when they're at that point and I got to tell you if someone finds heroin in your pocket when you get caught shoplifting and you're likely shoplifting in order to buy the heroin\nOr when that happens that is a point where you might be receptive to treatment you might be the most receptive to treatment especially\nIf it means all those other negative consequences don't happen vision yeah your job your head right here everything and so not everyone's ripe for the opportunity to be deflected a lot of people are still going to be going to jail for it I get that but the truth is\nThis program is just outstanding Lee successful I mean I Would have told you that three years ago we didn't envision\nTen percent maintaining contact with treatment after they walked out the door\nAnd the things that were at fifty or sixty or Seventy percent somewhere in that range is just astronomically successful it's beyond anyone's wildest dreams so for those people who sat and said no we need to put them all in jail it just wasn't working it just wasn't working and then this approach we can give it a shot and you talked about\nEven if you don't have somebody in your family who is affected by it you're still affected by it because who pays for the class to jail\n[noise] yeah exactly I mean the cost to put people in jail is not just the cost to put him in jail it's a cost of taking care of their kids it's a ... it's just an astronomically expensive proposition if what you're concerned about is money it is very expensive for people who have substance use disorder century that\nNot only that but so much as I said earlier so much of the crime that we that we see the property crime you know the perjury that's the shoplifting that it's all associated with\nPeople who have substance use disorder is trying to either get merchandise that they can sell or trade for their drugs so again going back to the bottom line how do we how do we begin to fix that is to treat the underlying problem\nThat was deafening during the break\nYou were asked about the origin of pocket drugs I don't know what that is so when people started to have more and more of the disorder problems\nWhat happened in the Nineteen nineties there was an article in New England Journal of medicine that instructed health care professionals to treat pain like it's a vital sign when we is that you we assess your blood pressure your heart rate your respiratory rate how much how much oxygen as in your blood\nWe're told me that need and start asking how much pain arguing and then because of that decision reimbursement position um\nReviews started to generate around your ability to control someone's paying sufficient started to feel I Need to get paid under control I went to prescribe opioids because what's better at controlling pain\n... years ago and they did some more research in the American Medical Association came back and said no way you can't do that you're creating a problem if I'm getting at we need to stop so they were told to stop doing that\nStop prescribing these high doses when we did that we wound up with a whole community of people who want things that they should never be in pain\nToo are dependent on opioids so now that is something that we are getting behind now we have people who are buying their drugs on the street because they think cut off\nTo prescribe or said no more so now you have to get at some point you're addicted people who are continue to use opioids don't use them because they want to get high they use them to avoid going into withdrawal\nThey're trying to avoid getting sick\nSomeone who doesn't to withdraw field now as yeah vomiting they have ... have a headache they're miserable this is the worst flu you ever imagine in your life that they're going through for days to try and get clean so in order to avoid that feeling they continue to you\nAnd and I'll go back to exactly to your point you know a a unfortunately of English teeth and I was at my dentist recently and\nI'd been there a year ago and and she told me that when we had this discussion and actually she has a lot of questions about what was going on and I talked with her about it and uh she told me the last time I was there a few weeks ago that she completely stopped

you've\nYou've gotta walk those because the thing is border security should not be a partisan issue it shouldn't be whether you want to call by person or not ... that's how the military that's why I

those ...\nThose opioid Oh yes they're showing Democrats or Republicans what their who they're killing our American mhm\nAnd that's why it is everybody's business and so when you understand the problem then you understand then you it helps you find the solution\nNo it's big I know the agents really appreciate when\nWhen people run for public office indeed take the time to go out there and see what we both right we don't have enough of that to be honest I Am thankful that you went out there and that you saw it because now you have you already have that edge because of that\nUm but it helps it it's very very helpful so your doctor up and I knew that so you're a doctor but you're a combat medic right are you all serious serious things out there\nThat's one of the things that inspired me to run I was in Afghanistan and two thousand and that was part of the Obama surge ... go out there in June right after General McChrystal took over it was very high op tempo we talked about a lot of that one on those patrols and convoys there was a lot of\nSort of reminiscent dry on that lonely highway or about like driving all those roads in Afghanistan and I tell you what I'm\nYou know when I saw people one of those things that folks don't realize and this is like nothing you would ever good measure could happen\nYou know our soldiers would be putting tourniquets on their arms and legs before we go out on patrol so that if you got blown up in your leg was dramatically amputated you could synch down your own tourniquet to save your own life\nBut when you see people doing that young men and women\nYou realize there's people risk and more than reelection risk and more than reputation and they do it you know and and as you know the camaraderie right being out there are people you know they brushed it off they kind of joke about it laugh about it but you know that is a big deal and they need a voice yes and I said to myself then\nThe national border

much is going to eat that day so he's always busy he's always doing something but\nHe's just a great guy all around I mean I I have had a lot of gifts but this one I think I consider him a real good friend\nI consider him a brother and he's a great guy he looks just amazing in that Greenland a trucker ...\nMarks Spencer former Phoenix pd\nTwenty five years Phoenix beauty fourteen years in ... and he was the president appeal for four years\nHe's also a pastor\nWas a pastor is that your title would it be pastor Chaplin I Know you're the chaplain for the national ... you're like you're a holy man well let's just put it this way my graduate degrees and the allergy yeah it's a very cool and it is and it's it's\nHow can I explain to listeners I hold back a lot but those have you didn't know who I Am and have talked to me\nUh it's hard for me to hold back with F bombs once in a while when I speak a\nMake you yeah I can vary I use the F bomb very eloquently I think but then I always get more and I'm Around mark and I feel I told us out and he's going to go on and say jeeze art that's toning it down what I Do because I Know it's like\nHey you know what I mean\nYou know what I'm saying mark and police work we would call that verbal judo so personally that's great see that's what I like it so tell us you know he just talked about it because I I Know I've read your book\nAnd and I said hey this we can plug your book here mark and people will buy it you'll be like a New York best seller you don't go to work well\nIn categories into like a bird book today but it certainly was a deal knowledge\nThe deep friendship that you know I've had with art and prior to our it would've been a\n... and it was random ... those crazy to do so much older guys\nOne guy I probably has less hair than you do Brandon has lesser than me says 'cause I grew up listening but but you're clearly the best looking I don't know who the smartest as much as ... and when when uh I work in Phoenix my last four years with the senior Sean force ration\nUm we encountered a serious problem well I shouldn't call it a problem I should call it a crime is called illegal immigration mhm uh it was literally killing my members have had six officers killed by illegal aliens oh it was literally killing\nOur Hispanic community partners in Phoenix right it was clearly a sanctuary city policy we went head to head with chief show this\nAnd got to change that we can not only hurting her successfully with federal immigration furnished but we could ... their success\nIn enforcing the law heck we do it with the FBI the da da da da and specter ... U.S Marshals but we weren't allowed to the border patrol or I should call they didn't make sense it was risky dangerous we saw the aftermath of that [noise]\nNo yeah I Know you guys went through some ... through some horrible times and obviously losing an officer just plain and simple is is a big deal and put you know what since since you were a police officer for the longest time you hear that argument though mark you hear the argument that a lot of people make of what we have criminals here what's the difference\nYou know is is is the illegals really that bad because but the way I see it is yeah I Know we have criminals here but we don't need to import more criminals right I mean that's what it comes down to well and that kind of talk\nYou can also outlying it sounds like the concept of unacceptable casualty rate mhm well only if\nI can imagine Steve Ferrara on the battlefield saying well we only had ten killed right no good doctor would be upset if he had one wounded a there is no acceptable casualty rates in proactive constitutionally base law enforcement\nOr we leave no man we leave no woman behind him these policies were forcing or actually mandating illegal aliens to commit another crime created another victim and cause more damage first before we could partner and proactively interact with border patrol and I\nKnow and I know you you've been very active for quite some time no just not as a police officer would you be a very active and and I I guess I call it the movement of making sure that a police officers are taken\nI don't want to be serious because I think they're taking serious but they're not taken for granted I guess is the word that I'd be looking for um you were very instrumental in helping the national book will counsel with a lot of the\nIssues that we've had in endorsements you've been very instrumental you I mean you help this form of great partnership with shoved George pile\nUm who think because of you e you've got an us in their front door and many times um and and there's just a lot of things that you've done\nI Want to ask you this though\nWhen you're twenty five years of of being a police officer\nYou were very uh Clint Eastwood is club dirty Harry you know a young Clint Eastwood of course not rowdy gates from raw but you know a little bit of a word she made it look old like an eighty two year old ... [laughter]\nI don't want your five bucks an hour later that you know nice where did I Know you would\nJoke clear you know and he's been out of the show a couple of times a day and he talked about the times you know his him being a security guard at the metro mall he was really and he got fired did he got fired for being as good as it is it is a nurse but in all your years did you ever tell one of the ...\nGo ahead make my day\nAbsolutely no no no I I Would advise him frequently have this thing called Miranda and how much of a wonderful time they would have insured for Joe's jail oh there you go back that no that's that's awesome so\nTwenty five years share a story mark delicious is what I hear a story you know we have a lot of law enforcement the listeners who have a lot of ah civilians and I'll listen to it\nUm I Know you've been we've been together at a lot of these well I don't know events where there's a lot of protesters and people that protest against law enforcement you seniors share of protests\nAgainst law enforcement yeah and I've seen my\nMy share of a lot of bad things involving law enforcement I'm clearly I'm\nBiased towards law enforcement in the sense that I greatly admire uh men and women who choose to run into a gunfight a it's a great honor to serve those who serve to help those who helped protect those\nWho protected that they would interest me with caring for them was a great honor a and and their success clearly him positively impacted the success of the community and when it's been\nWhat it's been delightful for me as the transition from the camaraderie and the partnership or in friendship from law enforcement and Phoenix\nTo federal immigration enforcement ... with the border patrol it's been very natural made a lot of sense for me so the ability to serve you guys and your membership\nOr not only you know political in a professional capacity certainly for my position and judicial watch Rahm but also from a from a spiritual capacity in the sense of providing some a Judeo Christian ethic some principals to encourage\nA to stay the course or because you know we always used to joke about\nEverybody loves a firefighter or\nNobody loves the cop when the firefighters are in your house it's a great thing though and the cop knocks on your door selling you're going to go to jail ... ... ... they're always behind the curve\nUm the men and women that I work with as well with you we never start to fight\nBut we always have to finish it\nAnd if we don't finish it correctly we're going to go home hurt or dead right and if we don't finish it legally we're going to go home indicted so there's a huge burden we don't start it but we finish it but yet we're a hundred percent responsible for the outcome that is a huge burden I admire anyone who gets paid\nThe pittance that local law enforcement of federal law enforcement gets paid for that huge of a New York I say you guys get paid a lot anyway\nYou know time limitation if you

those folks but uh it's an excellent book um it's a very long about a thousand pages so it's going to take me probably four months to read it the rate I go but\nUm people don't know they really need to explore history um a lot of things in history give me hope and and us ground is one of those things um\nHe was a ... odd it often in his life he was at the bottom I mean he was a failure in many many ways is failure in business I was drummed out of the service because of alcoholism or the alleged alcoholism\nUm he had a very mediocre presidency after ... rising as high as you could go in the union army or to really be in the hero of the civil war a to then I'm a failed presidency in in in impoverished his family\nPeople do not know that um he was um shortly after ... are not being president anymore he was diagnosed with cancer\nAnd was terminal and somebody approached him about writing his memoirs and we're going to pay him of the very sizable sum of money to ride his memoirs so as grant is literally dying from cancer he is dictating his memoirs\nAnd I'm very shortly after he dictated the very last party he died but it was very important to him that his family did not die impoverished\nAnd that's how he provided for it so if you get a chance to read grass memoirs excellent read very much a will to get your heartstrings um Lincoln is another one of those figures in history that um\nIs a really outstanding um another book I really highly recommend this team of rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin a excellent book a talks about the rise of Lincoln in the Republican Party and um another one that's excellent is April Eighteenth sixty five talks about the month of\nApril and Eighteen sixty five the end of the civil war a assassination of President Lincoln um and that this country could have spawn into a civil war that you know guerrilla war that would've lasted forever\nAnd it's really the work of grant a Lee and Sherman that prevented that because there was this big vacuum of leadership in the country after the assassination of Lincoln and\nThese people that were I mean absolute warriors\nAre shut down and they really prevented a that degenerating into a guerilla warfare that would've lasted\nWho knows how long um but it's a very good reading I think that I'm a country that does not understand it's histories is doomed to repeat it um and I think we really need to look him my personal love is from Eighteen fifty five to Nineteen fifty five\nAh just part of the civil war the birth of the Republican Party um to the end of the Korean War\nAnd that hundred year period or the United states of America changed very very significant way and ah I encourage people to study their history and and look at politicians not from what you heard on CNN or Fox News or whatever but to actually uh study this stuff in and to know your history\n... did you read the book that a McCain road before he passed\nI'm not I don't tend to re contemporary history I really stop about Nineteen fifty five ... I'm a red Reagan's biographies probably the closest I've come\nI'm I Will say the bill O'Reilly Books and I know he probably didn't write most of it but the killing series is pretty good ah killing Reagan is a pretty good book a killing pat and\nA killing Kennedy um he's not really very generous in his book about Reagan or he's not very generous and his uh viewer you'd think he would be a but he's really not uh that's that's an excellent book\nUm that's one of things I Want to do when I retire is I Want to have more time to read and I know it seems silly but I enjoy I enjoy reading there is a civil war series by Shelby Foote as three volume series it's a well more than a thousand pages\nOr but I'd really like to be able to Wade through that because it's excellent ah excellent book I'm kind of a weird share of 'em [laughter] I'm a Republican with a very progressive education and that makes me I'm a enough in the center to make a lot of people mad at me 'cause I get hit in the right cheek and the left cheek all the time and that must mean I'm doing something that's okay I guess\nWell like you said right is right and health lay right will prevail I know there's a lot of uh books written lately [laughter] um the\nCurrent administration you intend to read any of that is no I think that history a tense to settle itself um\nWhat we think of being history today or or somebody's opinion today\nThat as time spins out um will change a little bit as we better understand what the times are I think we understand I'm John F. Kennedy better now than we did in Nineteen Seventy here um that we understand more about Martin Luther king than we might have a right after his his death\nSo I think that we need time to settle these things a little bit and to have a more clear all clear retrospect 'cause it's clouded right now by a lot of emotion and a lot of\nA discussion back and forth um it's really unclear um you know if if President Trump runs another term and he ends up being a two term president\nHow ... history will really treat this time it's unclear as it's currently unclear on how Brock Obama's presidency will be treated I just don't think enough time we need time to settle that and to then go back in a very rational way and look at what was really accomplish or what was it\nHow do you feel about Nixon\nNixon would have been an excellent president had he not had um moral failures um and I would almost say the same thing about Bill Clinton\nA Bill Clinton was an out Republicans you're about to crash or vehicles out there I Know that a Clinton was actually a pretty adept president but he had some moral failings\nI'm President Nixon was actually pretty effective but he had these psychological failings um they've caused his presidency to not be as as good as it otherwise could have been\nHis are really intelligent man\nHe did a lot of the you know to eat we were out of Vietnam he did a establish relationship with the Chinese there were a lot of things have happened under the Nixon administration that were actually fairly good and he was a very intelligent man\nI'm you know people think that ah John F. Kennedy was so popular well in the time of his presidency was not that popular\nOh I think we look back on Lyndon Johnson and say there's some pretty good things by the way the movie um LBJ that um that Woody Harrelson plays LBJ in that movie I thought he could never pull that off\nBut he did and it's historically accurate um that's one thing I think that really bugs me is when I look at history movies a lot of them are so historically inaccurate it makes me ... the the movie on Lincoln where they go to Tommy Lee Jones and Sally field's plays a ... a his wife I\nWas awful from a historical perspective it was absolute garbage\nIt just it I could I had to walk out of the room I was getting so angry 'cause it was just it was just not historically accurate at all um but I think time these settled those things so I think maybe in Twenty years or will be able to look back on Trump's presidency in Obama's and it'd be more rational about it than we will be able to do today\nYeah I think that um people during the Nixon administration and the way things are happening and my dad always said you know step outside of that that's all you're in it what's going on you have a better perspective\nAnd I think time is required for that a little bit too I think that\nYou know you need to get a little separation of time and then reflect back on a more calmly I'm Bill Clinton did a lot of very decent things as president ah but his moral failures overshadowed a lot of those things\nThere was a lot of bipartisanship under the Clinton Administration um Reagan did a better job of that but now we become very very divided again\nAnd I think we need to kind of get back to a little bit of the middle ground and for those elected officials out there remember why we put you in office\nThat we put you in office to get things done to move our country forward not to see what you could obstruct are are getting away ah we want you to move our country forward that's why we put you they're not so you could get a pension not so you could run around saying your senator or congressman such and such\nWe put you there to get stuff done and I think a lot of these people on all sides a lot of blame to go around here are letting us down\nOkay I think we've only got about a minute left but I wanted to touch base on really quick about some of the scams that are going on your office get calls I Know all the time what is the latest and greatest don't do it scam\nThe latest and greatest is really simple if it if it looks too good to be true it is um you're not gonna get unsolicited emails from the IRS or your bank asking you for personal information\nUm and a lot of these are exceptionally convincing my wife took a call from Microsoft and I walked through the house that I just got home she goes oh Microsoft is on here there's something wrong with our computer they\nWant access to it and she had bought it they had they had the hook in deep and my wife bought that they're very good at what\nThey do I'm so be very careful and uh use good judgment out there\nThank you for coming on happy to be your ... being here and until next week I Want everybody to shop local stay stay and stay tuned for border patrol you'll mortgage\nHe has an equal housing lender and I'm a less three to seven for sure here's an animal less one zero sixty five one age is license to do business in the state of Arizona and California\nBecame number one oh six eight five one age ...

they just told me are they just they are they don't even say grandpa they are are there are all good or that they can grab a big cut grandpa those medical it is kinda cool but I don't\nKnow dude I was critical grow old ... that's a scary\nThing I knew I was ... years old when my granddaughter was on um\nShe was on a a face but it's nice to have a class and she didn't have stepped it and finally I said are no they aren't you going to accept your grandpa she goes no grab bars with a bunch of zeroes ah hey well yeah that is kind of crazy\nWhen I had a cool though they got I mean that's your social life yeah and they don't want you know what I mean it's kinda weird yeah\nCouple of years later she ended up asking me to be see how they grow up and they get to a certain point did you approve or it was pretty funny no hell no [laughter]\n\nThat's fantastic fantastic [laughter]\nLove that hey we're going to take a real quick break folks were going to come back with a President Trump's talk on condemning some Democrats on uh the way they're acting towards ... ice and the way they're acting towards law enforcement in general uh I'm hoping to get to a later on in the show on the more apprehensions\nThat we're seeing and obviously the crisis that the human ... the human scrub nurse the human smugglers are creating in Arizona and ah you'll be interesting to hear that there's some managers especially at the Tucson station\nThat are not a really helping with this crisis and uh they're just they're taking advantage of some\nBorder patrol agents and I wanted to talk about that because as always enjoy exposing fully and I think that's the mentality that is going on at the Tucson station particular anything going a little bit\nSo join us after the break [noise]\nMen and women who carry their gear Gerber is unstoppable decades of innovation and dedication and put them on Tom Green out as a master of knives and tools reverse problem solving lifesaving products are designed with unique phase of specific activities in mind today that includes much more than a blade it is a lifestyle\nWhen law enforcement and tactical professionals need quality product they go five eleven tactical ... or the loyalty and trust of those protecting humidity and families worldwide we're proud to have five eleven is our sponsor Ross remote they're funny because they ever our respect and so forth [noise] hey\nPrejudice can\nDamned some Democrats and their attempts to a sort of police from cooperating with ice and in stemming tide of these lethal drugs\nAnd I think it's important for people to understand because\nWe have way too many people that are running for political positions that are anti law enforcement\nAnd it's it's scary when you start looking at and at the same time I think\nYou have individuals that are already in political positions that don't understand what it is that we do so what they're doing is\nThey're trying to make the villains that way they can pull the votes from a certain group of people right when it comes down to a like these antifa jerks that you see all the time um which I've seen some of these on these\nGuys are probably get the one big yoked anti forgot to come after me but it is what it is I just tell you that I see some of these antifa folks and uh some of these and our so called anarchists and\nKnow Andy I don't think they could fight their way out of a paper bag right you know they're pretty weak looking individuals' a but apparently they think they can be tough guys and they're out there talking about it and one thing that I wanted to talk when I get to President Trump's remarks right\nBut one thing I Want to talk of was there was um some antifa folks\nOn September twenty first is when the media first reported it right\nAnd uh it was a website was on it and ... and it did call for the slaughter of it this is what it says the call it's a call for the slaughter of fastest\nBorder patrol dogs and their boss wow and that's in reference to uh to publish claims that are known by a ... activists\nSo it goes on and it shows and it says um killers and brown sugar uniforms which we don't wear brown so they already are colorblind\nHow the United states border patrol brutalizes the ... and uh it was written on the September twentieth of twenty teen and then they're well known anti fur activists it's there the writers and the news service and uh I think his name as all Rick Salazar\nAnd they called themselves revolutionaries and it's time to rise up with the masses right and and cause violence against fastest border patrol dogs and their boss he goes on to say slaying them slaying them that's what it says\n... them with revolutionary fire and just as\nThe source also stated that they said a red guards and their supporters as they have said just before the time for activism is over now is the time for war\nBelieve that so they're calling out for an all out war on against border patrol agents directly it's a little right on the source also advocated to end or the barbarism that the U.S imperialism or ...\nFor masses from Central America and Mexico to exact rubble luge revolutionary vengeance and seize power\nWell I don't see that has done it enough media play\nAnd I don't think people know what antifa how the the ... started where it started I don't think people really know about it just is you hear it once in a while and that's\nIt yeah they're bugs is what they are then you'd be squashed and I know it sounds horrible to say it and then they'll say oh well arts law enforcement and he said you know what guys these people are domestic terrorism there are a threat to America there are a threat to our way of life\nAnd I took an oath to defend this country against all terrorists foreign\nAnd domestic and that's where people are getting lost and these people are domestic terrorists\nBut to go ahead and say it's time to stop activism it's time to start the war it's time to go on an all out war hey listen man at the end of the day I just want to live to be an old man\nAnd some of these on T. for guys come and there's a problem and I got to take a few of them with me so be it\nShould agents keep their eyes open ... or even more no I've always like this I've always\nI think all of them for spent wintertime we're all on force but needs to keep their eyes open and you have these certain regimes and you have these these actors so called activists\nAnd you have these throughout the entire border though the um the ... the hubs across the border people as I like to call them you know and and\nThey're anti law enforcement that's when it comes down to and they say well\nThe you know the people that you guys were wrestling are not criminals I break into your house and my criminal\nIf I just go into your window at my luminal yeah you know I'm a criminal you know if I Need something I'm going to go in there just to take it 'cause I'm In need store criminal you know regardless of if I'm Broken into your house before are not at all it takes is one time and I'm a criminal so I'm tired of hearing this oh well these these\nIllegal immigrants do not need to go to a concert legal aliens I'm tired of hearing that don't call them aliens for one I'm tired of hearing people\nAttacked that that's the legal word illegal aliens and the reality is\nI don't care if you break into the country once twice or if it's your hundredth time you're breaking our laws of our country and you are a criminal\nYou may not like it you may be bothered by the fact that you're being called the criminal journal criminal\nAnd and and a lot of it stemmed and my my frustration is when I did this Fox a town hall John ... couple of weeks ago yeah there was a girl there and she was very like don't call me a criminal don't call me an alien that's what you are\nAnd then I and then went on her face on our on our Instagram page on her Instagram per person on Instagram page right [noise] and\nOffer pictures are or how Mexico's fantastic how she root for the Mexican team how the Mexican seems so great in fact she has a picture on her um Instagram\nWhere it's her birthday cake right and it's a Mexican flag ... so I'm sitting here going didn't why do you want to be a citizen of this country\nYeah you know what I mean it just doesn't make any sense you're allegiance is obviously not here it's over there so go I'm I'm okay with you just\nPractice what you preach yeah right oh\nI got so many things in my head that I Want to talk about\nPresident Trump delivered those ... or some remarks are at the one hundred and twenty fifth annual conference as and exposition of International Association\nAnd I have heard for those that have a problem getting out to the polls that some of the uh ride services are going to be doing free rides to the polls so getting ... who's going to be dependent on your that's great who you're using but they want to make sure that people get out and vote\nAgents needs to go out and vote I I talked to two and a lot of agents and they're like a you know I didn't have time on it and go no\nGo bolt plain and simple go vote if if you're at work and it's you're working well into the hours where you don't go and you can't make sure that they give you the opportunity to by law they have to let you go All right that's just the way it works\nUm we'll take a break I said we wouldn't but we're not break anyway I'm because I'm going to talk about this breaks and what people get away with and ... and ...\nWho does what and who doesn't do something a particularly as I keep teasing some issues at the Tucson ... [noise] you're listening to the\nTexas federal wellness center founded with a vision based on principles focused on superior healthcare utilizing a combination of physical medicine physical therapy and surgical expertise visit the website at Texas F. W. C. dot com [noise]\nThis is the green line\nAs the vice president of the national border patrol council I represent more than Fifteen thousand border agents we need leaders will help us fix the border prices\nHere since cinema opposed funding to help law enforcement side to drug cartels and she supported dangerous sanctuary city policies here say cinema is weak on borders security the national border patrol council was proud to endorse Martha ... for Senate and we know Martha has her back and she'll do what it takes to secure the border\nAnd my family and I approve this message and now back to the green [noise]\nBack and they want to talk about prevention\nRio Grande valley sector chief ... by the uh says that the numbers have doubled for those crossing the border illegally\nOver for thousands or four thousand arrests were made for the first week of this fiscal year compared to just over two thousand arrest being made on October of twenty Seventy they've doubled why do you think they've doubled\nBecause catch and release is still going on\nBecause there's no consequences for the individuals that are breaking our immigration laws because the rhetoric alone that President Trump delivered when he first took over office dropped the numbers and our leaders within the United states border patrol failed to\nAct upon that window that's when it comes down to why because this is what you have\nYou have an all star team which is the border patrol agents to there are altered then you have the managers and the coaches the general manager all that\nAnd then you have the owner which in this case I Will attribute the owner as being President Trump so it works right so we are\nI Would say under new ownership with all star players\nThat need motivation that need the proper\nGloves hats balls foot wear uniforms they need all that the owner wants\nTo give them too but the general manager who's been a general manager for quite some time uh is a feeding different information probably to the owner then you've got the coaches and the manager\nWho are are the same coaches and managers that were there before they just change their position one turned into another manager and the other one is now the batting coach and just\nFlip flopped [noise] so where is the problem\nIn the managerial staff got all star players I just say the all star players were the ones that were in line wanting this new owner and they're happy with the new owner\nPresident Trump the issue has always been\nThe general manager and the and the manager of the coaches of the team [noise] we're not going to change the game plan if you have the same manager in the same general manager no I'm not saying fire\nOr higher position leaders\nBut give them another position somewhere else I don't know that's all I'm saying I think we have good leaders within border patrol\nI think a lot of them are going to be retiring here soon because it's their time to retire then they're done and they don't see any change and I see it all the time with some of the leadership I speak to\n'em it's going to be a scary next few years because we have\nI don't know less than responsible\nOr less than professional leaders that are going to be staying and they're going to be getting higher positions now and then you shouldn't have the higher ups which are running the organization that are still running it and they're doing a horrible\nJob [noise] so that's my rent on that because I think it's important that\nThe\nThe regular citizen understand I'm not trying to attack because there are certain things I Want to hold back on not because I'm scared to say it but because I don't want the general public to think\nHere's art just ranting and raving attacking his agency I'm not attacking my agency we have fantastic agents right we have fantastic leaders unfortunately many of the managers that are in this agency that are calling\nThe shots and the bigger wig people are in DC that are calling the shots are doing a horrible job\nAt the expect at the expense of the agents and at the expense of um some of the leaders that actually want to be leaders it's just the way it is yeah\nYou're seeing this crisis you're seeing the amount of individuals are coming to the United states you're seeing it here in Arizona as I said more than fourteen hundred Central American illegals primarily from Guatemala have been found traveling in large group since August in remote areas in different parts of the desert in Arizona\nI've been surprised to see the number of groups you don't have it you think two three four maybe five people to the hundreds ... amazing hundred people because there's no consequences ... there's no classrooms are getting ... to getting released so for listeners who don't know what catch 'em all leases and I know we've explained to orbit ages catch him\nThey fingerprint um they don't have any prior criminal history the United states keep in mind I don't have the database of their country so I don't know if they committed crimes and their country right\nUm there's nowhere to house them\nSo you release them you're making pinkie swear that they're short for an immigration court that's it based on a\n... I mean there's more through the process obviously or paper was but that's in it then and then that show that's what it is\nNo consequences or you know they were talk we were talking about the crisis the Arizona issue the agency did cite that at least eight years instances since August twentieth in which a group\nMore than a hundred undocumented aliens usually including families and small children were found in areas of south west Arizona\nNow I talked ah somebody sent me a message I don't even know what was it I get I get messages all the time and a lot of people and there was a big group that they arrested and are they all had the same phone number in their pocket\nRight and so this I guess this guy is an uncle to over a hundred individuals but they answered head you know so and so you're the uncle\nYeah I Am just what catch and release you know it's obvious that it's a smuggling organization is just ridiculous and they're laughing at our laws you that's what upsets the heck out of me you know um\nYou see the amount of illegals that are coming through you see them you know turning themselves in large groups you know ... huge groups that are coming through there and they're coming through Yuma\nThey're coming through 'em or ... or ... grand valley there everywhere you know a chief or Anthony provides Nick how to humans did say this is a humanitarian crisis that is impacting border security\nWhere the judges what immigration judges and you know why aren't they at the border we\nThere's a you go to the Tucson sector and there's a sign parking and one of the spots is assigned for the immigration judge right there is no one ever part there oh\nYou can't even find parking at Tucson station but yet the judge has a parking spot and he's never even there which is crazy it just said you know what I mean it's just I don't understand how this thing gets run 'em\nAnd so this is affecting a lot of the agents [noise] I see this too yeah and I'll tell you where where this is where it there's a twist\nYou heard me say there's managers that aren't really leaders and that's just I guess it's everywhere but\nI Need to find out I don't want to drop his name yet until I'm One hundred percent sure it did happen right\nBut we had a leader at ... to ... well we had a manager at the at the Tucson station right debt ordered an agent to go to handle a case which he can do that's why I'm not saying that's part of our job right and managers yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Green Line", "city": "Tucson", "day": "13", "locations": [["the United states of America", 18.01031, -66.62398], ["Nineteen Seventy", 31.1914, 73.45856], ["Vietnam", 16.16667, 107.83333], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["Iran", 32.0, 53.0], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["United states", -14.60485, -57.65625], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["Texas", 31.25044, -99.25061], ["Texas", 31.25044, -99.25061], ["sanctuary city", 7.2426, 134.35018], ["United states", -14.60485, -57.65625], ["DC", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["United states", -14.60485, -57.65625], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["Tucson, AZ", 32.22174, -110.92648], "in_country": ["Arizona", "California", "California", "America", "Arizona", "Tucson", "Tucson", "U.S", "America", "Tucson", "Texas", "Texas", "DC", "the United states", "Arizona", "Arizona", "Arizona", "Arizona", "Tucson", "Tucson", "Tucson"], "out_country": ["the United states of America", "Nineteen Seventy", "Vietnam", "Iran", "United states", "Mexico", "Mexico", "sanctuary city", "United states", "Guatemala", "United states"], "in_state": ["Arizona", "Arizona", "Tucson", "Tucson", "Tucson", "Arizona", "Arizona", "Arizona", "Arizona", "Tucson", "Tucson", "Tucson"], "out_state": ["the United states of America", "Nineteen Seventy", "Vietnam", "California", "Iran", "California", "America", "United states", "U.S", "Mexico", "America", "Mexico", "Texas", "Texas", "sanctuary city", "United states", "DC", "the United states", "Guatemala", "United states"]}]
