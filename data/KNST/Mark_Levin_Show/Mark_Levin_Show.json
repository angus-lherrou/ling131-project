three one two three eight one one what's an honor to have the ambassador\nTo the United states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on or what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with and what did you see there's there\nWhile it's you know a horrific act or worse than a Semitic attack and us history that climate eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nThat to meet with are members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive\nI'm with Senator Casey was there we had a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talked to a lot of people I have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think a special community and squirrel hill a Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight it\nIt's not just by it among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went for the event last night\nUh that really brought out the entire community faith leaders that Christians are Jewish faith leaders of most from leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and stuff on a and what I wanted to do with Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them that they're not alone\nAnd in Israel yesterday morning our government meets on Sunday 'cause some days like Monday Israel the first day of the week and the government meets every Sunday and there was a moment of silence for the entire\nGovernment of Israel ... because we are the one and only Jewish state so we feel a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why I was for me to be in Pittsburgh yesterday\nYou were born in Miami I just want people to know this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami your brother was the mayor Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach was about that yeah we're the ones with the speech that that's true um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you were an Israeli citizen and you are you\nVery close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see grueling anti Semitism throughout your him or the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nOr we can ... it is as you say a growing problem or many people want to say that it began in two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you should look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned\nAh in two thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen\nA hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population mark and their\nAccounting for over half and by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of uh\nUh attack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen [noise] I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades what you had was about a half century after the Holocaust\nWhere it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades\nIs that it once again become fashionable or to attack juice and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves\nBehind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state but at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America\nIt's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing ... attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six hundred you federation in Seattle\nWas an attack in two thousand fourteen Jewish community center a added outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claim three lives and this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people um you\nCould have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans um and there's a stream is saying I can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually\nBuild communities of hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media as you have this rise of abuse online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous Senate dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel\nWe monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your in laws constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see when sort of this kind of hate pops up\nAnd then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I ... I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to\nNot just calling it when it's on the other side but calling it on your outside whether it's David Duke whether it was fair con wherever cops or it's not a college campus with people trying to think about Israel and the same and the human eyes is to make all these charges that Israel's apartheid state of racist state a perpetrator of Canada\nWhich I think triggers a lot of people put a level of hatred towards Israel but you don't see of any other country this demonization wherever it is people have to stand up to it and I think in protecting the terms I think they're going to be protecting\nAlright and bashing Iran drummer of Israel we appreciate your time God Bless them thank you sir thanks\n[noise] he's really good okay I've laid out he's laid it out any objective news organization should be ... but they're not going to cause they're not objective when they're really no news organizations anymore not many of them\nYou know falls officially here temperatures across the country are dropping certainly are where I live after a long summer of running your air condition the time is quickly approaching the start running your heater is temperatures Trump and most of the country\nThe national weather center saying the north and central part of the U.S will experience a cold or October than years passed now is the perfect time to consider servicing your system and replacing your age ... filters\nWe have the perfect company to help you make your life that much easier filter by dot com America's leading provider of H ... for homes and small businesses\nChoose for over six hundred sizes including custom options that ship free within twenty four hours plus they support working Americans manufacturing all their filters right here in America say five percent when\nYou subscribe pro auto replacement so you'll never forget to change your filters ever again filtered by will save you time money and help you breathe better that's filtered DUI dot com filtered by dot com and tell them more accent you\nLook we need to spend a lot of time on this election that's coming up too and we have approximately ten candidates that are coming on this program in the course of this week\nI Will also be doing an appearance on Hannity or at some point this week and we're going to commit my Sunday show to the pre election as well it's just way too important he's got some very very close races and what's at stake here is enormous\nAs I say it's Americanism versus socialism it really is for those of you really know what's Americanism versus progressive isn't to talk to you know the media in this country and they don't want to be called the enemy of the people there are certainly not the friend of the people gone long ago a is the day\nWhen CNN and MSNBC and these these used to be reputable organization really focused on reporting the news rather than driving the news and creating the news these news conferences now at the White House\nYou clean nothing that's newsworthy nothing I'll be right back [noise] month\nThanks for listening to me on K n empty am seven Ninety\nIf your financial planners even slightly out of tune you may be paying too much for taxes exposing yourself to too much risk before retiring was a sound income bland most of the money talks with CJ house of triple age financial group every Saturday at three PM to get your financial future into\nOnly on cayenne S.

covering this race correctly\nFBI undercover agent paid food tab for Andrew Gillum fundraiser documents reveal let me tell you a Florida particularly you independence haven't voted yet or thinking about it you can have a guy here who is under investigation for his entire governorship if you'll elect\nHim as your governor because this guy was taken freebies left and right you know about the Costa Rica trip you know about the Hamilton ticket you know about the hotel in New York City these things are worth thousands of dollars\nBut here's the breaking story tonight by the Tallahassee Democrat and undercover FBI agent\nPosing as an Atlanta developer seeking to do business with the city of Tallahassee where he was mayor Gillum\nPicked up the catering bill for eight twenty sixteen fundraiser for mayor Andrew Gillum nascent political action committee forward Florida\nThe pack would eventually become the war chest of gallons gubernatorial campaign it is the first piece of evidence linking the ongoing FBI pro to Gillum broader campaign for statewide office and this stuff's trickling out trickling out not due to the ... campaign or the Republicans\nBut due to one of the people whose caught up in this lobby\n\nThe emails and receipts released friday today as part of a supplemental records requests from the Florida commission on ethics\nShows that the agent the undercover FBI agent Mike Miller was in voice four thousand three hundred and eighty six dollars by one oh one restaurant in ... lounge a restaurant owned by lobbyists Adam Corey at the time to this guy Korea's buddies\nOr was would Gillum\nAnd email exchange shows that Miller paid the bill and Gillum sent him a personal thank you I didn't say thank you note or for the food now Gillum has been a line through his teeth all along about the extent of this investigation and he knows the extent of the ... investigation\nIt's been lying about the extent of the FBI investigation he's been lying about his involvement and corruption in the city\nOf Tallahassee and it is corrupt and today again is trashing police officers police officers that are forced to to to draw a weapon even a taser well then they blown it according to him\nMonth after meeting Mike Miller this is the FBI undercover agent for breakfast that the power plant cafe or at the Edison\nCorey that's the lobbyists and lifted the undercover agent to help foot the bill for a fundraising dinner at Korea's house on behalf of columns gubernatorial campaign I'll keep in mind or Cory the lobbyist than buddy of a Gillum didn't know that this guy Miller was undercover agent of course\n[noise] email exchange between Corey\nAnd lo and Bryce Barnes a Florida Democratic Party official will go on to become finance director for ... or ... campaign show them arranging a dinner fundraiser accords house for forward\nA Florida Gillum gubernatorial pack the pack was originally set up as they generally so now you have a his gubernatorial pack\nDoing a fundraiser and the meal is paid for by the undercover agent the undercover FBI agent not clearly that's illegal\nThe flyers build the event is honoring Gillum and in one email Barnes described it as the first kick up a event for his campaign so tend to buy roughly forty Tallahassee notable\nIncluding this one in that one we've passed way with the outstanding to get to thirty seven thousand eight hundred and fifty whatever we can push to get us over that forty thousand dollar mark would be amazing Barnes wrote the Corey thank you again for all your work to make it successful event last\nMinimum donation for the dinner was five thousand dollars a person\nCory the lobbyist embodied Gillum arranged an alternative donations from Miller the undercover FBI agent quote in ...\nIs helping to underwrite the cost of the meals and drinks we enjoyed quarter road to Barnes\n\nA year before he announced his candidacy in two months before the fundraiser Gillum and Daniels flew to Tampa to meet leach senior vice president of south port financial services and affordable housing developer and democratic fundraiser\n\nThere was no federal government there was no national government when the declaration of independence was adopted\n\nUnalienable rights natural rights aggressive as them reject saw this he knows that he's ... he knows where Woodrow Wilson stood and Franklin Roosevelt stood he knows all about John ... and\nAnd Henry crawly and all the rest that I've written about at some length\n\nHe knows mark swelling angles well and Hagel well\nAnd he knows that in order to create this utopia which is really hell on earth you have to destroy these institutions\n\nYou have to destroy the institutions unalienable rights has nothing to do with the progressive agenda\nPro union anti union minimum wage no minimum wage health care no health has nothing to do with that it is a recognition that we are human beings that we're individuals and we have the right to be free\n\nAnd we're supposed to be treated equally under the law\n\nNothing to do with economic outcomes are minimum wage or the laundry list of or the left wing agenda and Obama in this just so you understand modern history Obama in this\nIs a regurgitate in things that have been said by Theodore Roosevelt and his new nationalism speech\n\nWoodrow Wilson and multiple speeches that he gave and all of them attack the declaration of independence or turn it inside out as Obama did what he's doing here isn't particularly smart you just stealing the propaganda the past hundred years old more\nThey wrap themselves in the declaration of independence\nBy\nRewriting by rewriting\nI don't have enough time to get into this again if you read or rediscovering Americanism and the tyranny of progressive ism you'll know exactly what's going on here as I said when I wrote it over a year old I'm not talking and I'm just saying if you want to understand that it's right there he wasn't done ... Seventeen go\nFor\nOne [noise]\nI don't know what that means first of all let's use English to keep what they've got you mean to keep what they have the powerful in the privileged fight hard to keep what they they got\nWhat does it mean\n\nWho are the powerful corporate\nExecutives or senators and congressmen professors who indoctrinate their students\nMedia personalities who who are the powerful exactly\nGeorge Soros style they want to keep what they got what does that\nMean they want to keep what they got\nIf you weren't something legitimately by your smarts by your hard work whatever of course you want to see what you got why shouldn't the most powerful people in this country or the people who run government\nBecause they have something that you do not have in the private sector you know what that is Mr producer\nThe law the law they control the law\nThey can punish people they can find people they can penalize people they can put people in prison\nThat's why the communist socialist the fascist they want to control the government they don't want to control this company or that company or this building that building they want the government they want to control the government your constitution which he claims to support and does not\nDoesn't control the individual it doesn't control business it doesn't control the private sector doesn't the Trump private property it's intended they controlled government\n\nBecause governments where the power is\nGovernments where the power it\nGo ahead\nAnd the first\nOne [noise]\nAnd by the way is is to visit rhetoric if somebody really believes what Obama said that this is what's going on that these people are privileged they're powerful they've taken they get to keep what they've got\nOr if they believe what ... says and the others saying compared Trump the Hitler and everything\nDoesn't that incite people go ahead\nGo and [noise]\nA whiz who does that here we have that demagogue pointing fingers at others and that's what demagogues do go ahead\nOh say see this is real hate speech is that what people say\nThis really is digging in the hatred and animosity and jealousies he says let's not they'll use history and racial ... look at the full\nUse racial division or ethnic division or religious division what did he just do\nIt's incredible\nHe's talking to a largely African American audience he knows exactly what he's done you won't hear CNN or MSNBC all those host and anchors all their gas you won't hear them play this and condemn Obama for his race baiting hey hey dating you won't hear a damn thing about this\nOther than the fact you listen to my program go ahead\nBut the main thing\nThey going to listen to this emphasize they will say whatever it takes to keep their stuff to maintain their privileges even if it's not fair especially if it's not fair\n\nThis is the man more than any man was held the presidency in recent times was undermined the unity of this country not Trump\nObama not Trump Obama go ahead [noise]\nIt's a cynical kind of money frankly sometimes it works\nIncredible incredible\nThe guy with airs Dorn ...\n\nThe guy who led the terrorists that are prison the guy who put an embassy in Cuba\n\nThe guy who gave tens of billions of dollars to the terrorist regime in Iran\n\nUnbelievable the things he says about this country the things he says about his fellow citizens\nThis is nothing short a Marxist propaganda while\nHe's raking in tens of millions and by the way did you see all the conflict going on about his library how he's trying to impose his library on a a a lower middle class neighborhood and they've taken him to court you seen any stories on that I bet you've seen damn phew\nBut Obama was truly trashing cops and law enforcement and holder was too and they're nationalizing these uh these local police departments and some of the really reckless things that they said whether it was ... center Baltimore both towns by the way ... which has not recovered from what took place a\nYou're not allowed to say that stuff you're not allowed to say that stuff and yet the fact\nIs their rhetoric was outrageous again I don't consider it being the reason that these are\nThese cops were murdered the guy was an absolute not and so forth and so on\nBut the media will never be consistent because the media are of Obama's ilk they are

when you're putting down in context you have to take a look at what it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters linked heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a a story I'm actually working out for my local shows your tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago chicken in the state's voter registration it broke into your interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yes up or did break for\nDonald Trump beyond that at\nSince the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past few years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nOh by the way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independents that have registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people to go out registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology you left our\nWho's a thoughtful conservative job that can happen in DC well it can happen other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and ... is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst ... you you take a look at the economy we have the best economy in a generation I never faulted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap they didn't know better they went through school here\nIn from a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck they hear Obama and they go with I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you got some lines that are up and\nThat's the gun in the in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justice is tax reform the end of the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years and by the way record unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember our do about the white men white men\nAnd Asia and the only ... only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right out oh by the way\nBut you also have the biggest increase in that take home pay in thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to\nLay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there is a little math and it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary than the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year\nOkay All right then you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when\nYou do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated suicides histories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but I I haven't seen a benefit for the tax cuts well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the way personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that make it adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not seeing it it'll be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government in interest free one but\nIt's still there because well over Ninety percent of people do benefit for the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean old that progress that I decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that in two years answer is if anything he probably is attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty he probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected and twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often we're we talk about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president\nThat was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not having that problem you take a look at not having Tea Party and and white people specifically\nAll these angry white men that are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration and guess what\nDoes it make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd be foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've released cat to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is\nHas been dealt with about as peacefully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped for despite not even talking about all that might even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under Scott\nI'm Talking about the new eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration said that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying there with Israel against Iran\nThat's holy cow material now that's where this whole situation with hey we got this journalist who by the way you know has a interesting history of his own that goes into a consulate in Turkey we have some ah folks from uh the the Saudi regime that dinner\nAnd a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating bought bond so we we have a missing journals okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot there anymore all at the started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it\nAnd it's important to know who in what these people are that we're still dealing with and I'll bring you the rest of the story as the late great one would have said uh I'm going to bring it back them up you're on the other side I Am Brian mud in for the great one month\nHim now you're afternoons stimulated on cayenne S.

I are best friends\nSave it goes all responsible are held to account\nAnswers are good and I'm Guy\nRaz at my parents they're on ah the mysterious case of a not Benjamin Button but the ... who has gone missing two weeks ago today and at this point\nIt's rather obvious that we've heard the rumors that have come out with Saudi Arabia or the other day I mean like we know the crazy thing yeah there's a little interrogation and yeah you know I mean that it would just\nI just really hated when when we accidentally kill I I'm Sorry sorry we won't do it again really\nThat apparently is what we're actually going to get or at least that's the rumor of what we are going to get out of Saudi Arabia while also having the assertion that uh hey the king this young and and hip king who's the women could draw right now I mean come\nOn I mean isn't he like yeah when they get dry\nSo he's so did that guy he doesn't know anything and and he's not supposed to do anything so that's where we we are in this process\nBy the the way the president was even talking about that today he said that for the record I have no financial interest in Saudi Arabia but he also said that he spoke with the gang and hey he denies everything denies eyes everything so\nThis is typical this is typical for a lottery\nWe don't know the exact where it was obviously\nAnd you had a lot of folks who say yeah you know wage shoot sanctions bring it on I mean let's just whatever it was Saudi Arabia the first thing is one be thankful that we were very close very close to energy independence in this country by the way did he know that we are now\nThe world's largest producer of oil and not Saudi Arabia\nRussia us us\nNot a great we're actually facing the get there in January we got there a little bit earlier it's also good about now because if Saudi Arabia and the influence they had 'em in a pack a day decided hey you know like we don't like putting pressure on us and they go ahead and dramatically reduce production you could see a spike in prices obviously that could hurt the economy boom he's you know what happens there\nSo that's one thing we got to consider in this entire process but the bigger one again as you do have this new younger hip king in Saudi Arabia\nWho is like yeah women can can drive now I mean look how progressive I Am and and equal rights and all that\nHe's on board with us against Iran and with Israel where you can get that in the middle east you take it for sure that's what complicates this deal but the problem is still is mentioned three law it's evil wherever it's it's ... there's nothing good about it\nWe have had\nOne thousand five hundred and eighty nine Islamic terror attacks around the world so far this year\nWe've had Ninety four hundred and eighty three people killed in additional Ninety six hundred injured\nOh by the way so Islamic terror still alive and well it's real law and are the folks that govern underage still sponsor terrorism and the least of which is ... Iran but here's the problem the dirty little secret about sharia law in Islam in governments predominantly in the middle east\nThere are still over forty of them that carry the tenants of sharia\nIncluding by the way Saudi Arabia now\nWe haven't necessarily had on track record to see how long that's going to remain part of the government the bigger problem is\nIf you're on board with shrimp your moral compass really sucks and if you were saying that you can like ah you know kill people and will because I don't know there are a woman they were rights or you're homosexual what else are you willing to do like this journalists thing for example so that's where this becomes the tangled Web\nAnd so it's it's easy to quarterback this thing it's much different to to be pragmatic with

loving every minute of it I mean this is enjoyable for him a major sanction the hell out of the old\n... and Lindsey Graham anyway a in this particular case that's what makes me nervous and it's what makes me not just the the\nIdea of just say Janelle Adam okay well what happens for example of Saudi Arabia is isn't it\nSo we're kind of been with you on Israel and against Iran but uh you know\nWe aren't feeling quite as as cordial as we had previously\nWhat happens to them and what happens if they say you know what\nWe're just gonna go ahead and turn off this big to do back and see what happens to oil prices and see if we can do something that a wreck the economy a little bit there for you know Presidents Day and things that that could happen any number of different applications so I think it's\nEasy for a Lindsey Graham who's out there and loving every\nOf it enjoying this newfound freedom maybe being the person you always wanted to be that he finally feel that at the speed is kinda fascinating if you think about it and I digress here you have Lindsey Graham is like I came out maybe said things that it would that have always meant to be sane\nAnd people did\nYou know you're talking about the Trump effect me take a look at it and the Republican Party Mitch McConnell got an incredible reception in Kentucky the other night I mean what does that ever happened\n[laughter] I mean\nIt's an interesting day these people clearly enjoying this this newfound freedom of the Trump effect that has come for them\nBut it's complicated it's complicated so I don't know but let's just go sanctioned the hell out of all that's the best answer and I'm not sure that we're necessarily going to find our our friend who uh is mysteriously ... where exactly Jamal soggy\nLet's go to Aaron in Kansas Erin go\nOh just a quick question if the king denies any knowledge of it ... it was a body ah it's obviously is not in the consulate anymore give us a body this poor guys in a hole somewhere still being torture\nYou know it's an interesting thought a if you were going to be really uh I don't know a ... if you're going to engage in in a war game I mean I I suppose you could end up putting up any number of Syria ... scenarios that at least of which would be well maybe when you ... the study officials leave\nThe consulate they left with them\nYou know if you are ... there there are any number of things that can happen I'm not sure that it would make sense for him to remain there and be tortured because when you're gonna have many more potential witnesses add a lot more difficult situation for even turkey to account for at that point so\nOf all the scenarios that two weeks later he's still there would be tortured I think would be among the least likely but hey see your point anything could be possible for the call\nNow I've been talking about the oddities the oddities politically in in some of the assumptions that often or not wise\nFor the first time such twenty fourteen

Fox News President Trump warning of a rush to judgment it when it comes to the disappearance of journalist you mall 'cause she'll be at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul it's evidence now that the Saudis had something to do with it\nWhen I ended up writing this was a headline I Believe it was on Sunday on CNBC how Taylor Swift political adores men could become the biggest red\nEver at the polls ... ever as the polls [laughter] I mean that OK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought\nHere's an actor last way pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking or stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in her home state of Tennessee\nThe effect of sweat surprise endorsement which was made the on Instagram post were felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now I'm\nGonna get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media as recently as a couple of days ago were still like oh my gosh it's happening I think it's quieted down a little bit over the past year or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going hey\nSo he was up in Tennessee or see I'm Taylor ... specific endorsement of the Democrat so Britain and tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nShe was averaging three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee alright Blackburn three point lead in the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect\nWhere is she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race or lead is now nine points\nSo oh\nNot exactly what you probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighed in on is negative six percent in a week so I like to say you got two sides histories and one side the facts but here's the deal\nYou got a lot of folks are if you buy the millionaire the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction I enter science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing that I'm In in the south in particular\nYou have a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities that are weighing in and specifically when she ended up outing herself pretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much\nEverything including the person she was endorsing seat if you're in Tennessee and you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons among others now\nShe said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values but you see here is that the the dirty little details Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from\nPennsylvania Pennsylvania\nAnd she happened only moved to Tennessee to pursue her music career high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life\nYou know in the you know Taylor Swift is to Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is due to Cherokee Indians you know the the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas that one now\nShe spoke of supporting el ... writes\nGB T rights as part of her Tennessee values by the white [noise] just what the Democrats the she endorsed\nBill Britain's and he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the right for it as much [laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in they'll go\n\nAnd then you got the optics you see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in Nashville that are yeah\nBut here's the thing anybody noticed that you got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who\nDoes not support gay marriage and host of other old GB T rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania so she's endorsing in the old white guy bat evil these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\n[laughter] I mean and there's a lot more we we can continue\nDown that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those into the the they pretty much get the point to and yellow and get a lot\nIn terms of Tennessee values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity in in Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the effect that they weren't as a painting I mean come on\nAll these celebrity endorsements worked right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm either way it wasn't an awkward moment I mean I did the trick always does\nAnd so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kind of Mr moment you see if she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nTend to the algae beats he writes values she couldn't actually weighed in in the primary because Columbia University actually did prove that\nSome Democrats are impressed by celebrities for example Columbia University they did show pretty empirically that in the two thousand eight democratic presidential primary\nOprah Winfrey's endorsement really did encourage an additional ... million people largely black do vote for ... Obama over Hillary Clinton\nSo if only Taylor Swift headway then whether Pennsylvania\nAlgae B. T. Tennessee values maybe she wouldn't have ended up with an old white guy who doesn't support gay marriage or the L G Beatty writes bend made her look like she is as clueless as she actually is that she could have had somebody\nThat you know it was going to shake it off do whatever it is but she does these days but nice try Taylor nice try and find a way by the way I asked for a tendency values part of the reason why you have the Democrat Bill Britain's and that is not supportive of those things\nEighty one percent of tennis fans are Christians fifty two percent of the evangelical variety\nOh by the way you might want to at least investigate the state that you claim to be from that you represent the values of just saying\nTo science histories one side effects anyway uh we're we're just getting warmed up this hour Brian ... in for the great one month\nIt's hard to imagine a more comprehensive takedown didn't Matt Damon ... cab at all and that's it now\nAnd he did\nGreat game serious Damon added several layers of really go to Kevin O's angry aggressive testimony before the Senate presenting him as a sputtering sniffing wait ... beer levine oh the ...\nCarey I owe a beer by the way below beer beer by the way I don't actually up here I don't really like beer I just ... me I'm a white guy insert joke here anyway but I Am a caricature of of\nJudicial temperament and the light of the sexual assault accusations against him when she has denied the sketch included in especially devastating line yeah they're standing in line not backing down I don't know the meaning\nOf the word stop uh\nThese guys are furious that evidently was what they had ... this is the moment you see what's gonna happen I don't know the meaning of the worst stop that's gonna be the one you know that means because you know hey uh-huh\nAnd then a few hours before the dress rehearsal at the show's next episode Kavanaugh was confirmed as a justice to the Supreme Court\nOh\nSNL can hardly be blamed mocked for failing to keep Kevin off the court\nYou know this is the world these people in this world that\nCan go and talk about your Tennessee values sailors with\nWhite guy he was not supportive of gay marriage and talking about your own gp values\nUnreal he's writing by the end for the great one more going on [noise]\nEvery time you go on line your Internet provider an advertising companies can track what you do and sell your personal information so how can you protect yourself computer experts recommend using a V.

had that music vigil of ... a vigil with\nSpringsteen and Tom Petty were they were pounding the war drums you recall that\nNot really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we won't back down um it was all a\nIt was all in a kind of aggressive music or that hinted towards we're coming at you but they're the same they recover from the same cloth especially Springsteen were they were anti war or if they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping that God that people are just not taken serious anymore\nWell I can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where this celebrity is going to play if you're in California I have no doubt that it plays in fact there is research that did show\nUp from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talked about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell the the first thing is you've got to find somebody who's open to the information if you find somebody who's close minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swath of that population that is not\nNot going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most offensive thing and I say there's not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of the judgment until I was sixteen that kinda thing didn't come up where where it was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania [laughter] name they drew many of the folks in Tennessee that those people\nAnd so it's kinda like a no offense to you and in in Jersey job but I mean in Tennessee you know Jersey\nNot not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point states\nAll jerseys kind of cut in half you know ah almost at the center of the state um for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know\nThe more conservative area but I just ... hoping to God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more\nThat's my hope\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is an irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know I just a\nWedding out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really ... you got some work to New Jersey oh let's go to a liberal land in Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota ailing\nOh I'm a liberal I have

B. S. that MPs is somehow\nConsulting with Trump did decide what to do at a time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have a western mine are Judeo Christian ethic we believe in due process at least Republicans do so what we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian bought a Saudi Arabian government in a Saudi Arabian consulates\nIn Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times in the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor\n... then we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show gave murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and ... and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out I guess Trump's responsible for that to\nIt never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the answer of course is no\nThis is the ah the event there's your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a bunch of other incidents that have arisen in the past several months that Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event\nHow can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all\nAnd somehow wash this upon him\nAnd stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen now is that possible but it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch it as if MPs his own speed dial with ... and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media\nWho thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that Brock Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Iran man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that and so because Saudi Arabia\nIs the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weak in Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not being enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThe ... the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel and Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together and lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding\nFriendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia by weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight\nYou may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost the five hundred billion dollars\nA of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran\nOur enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis\nCountries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal ... show gig and stupidly they decided to pick a consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a\nViolation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks are the odds you\nKnow what I say have at it but according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the midterms and so things are heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and a Montana president it's going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp that allows the thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days the news media said wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can't have that so they started this other thing about Jamal ...\nWho was killed in Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen by illegal aliens\nThere was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage MS Thirteen with are girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now\nAnd so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction and his resume and prove all rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what\nThis is going the wrong direction\nIf we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's going to happen in the house I have no idea\nSo so let's continue with more than ... line becomes available which it never\nIce Karen Lewis\nState Mike Pompeo checking out this weekend tissue

the great when Mark Sullivan way of case and Chris and Josh and many others to lines are open\nTo you know the ... ... if you'd desire to join his eight seven seven three one two three one one last thing before I go to you\nI keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on\nThat uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you\nSeventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine nine percent never get U.S Supreme court and so if in twenty days the Senate flips through the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirm any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point and Trump is reelected which most of us believe he will\nDo this and that stays democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate you could nominate but they will not confirmed one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental\nSecondly all the investigations\nThat the house of becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely the investigations of every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life\nJared Kushner's life everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare and the next two years will not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving the mob power by putting their house back in Georgia Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens it's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another\nAspect to courses foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good\nNorth Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by the Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria\nForeign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international experts the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history how were the stock market react if Nancy Pelosi begins investigations\nEvery aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats who wants to eliminate Trump from office so if you went the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about a and only about investigations and impeachments in a hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot\nSo when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them and and play some of his thoughts later on if that happens\nDo they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse ed comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good\nAnd so think about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are as incentivize is they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivize and if you incentivize the mob\nBy buying them off or paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now we have are keeping a Los Angeles than Chris in Atlanta line becomes

though and if you look and recently um John Brennan the laugh test today and they say he confirmed that his operative so I think\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue in the final point\nOut on the on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS\nWhy why why do you rely upon al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe al Jazeera out a cutter why do you believe them I wouldn't believe one word they said\nOkay I hear what you're

instead of dealing with that let's talk about ... trip to Africa how did things go\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much about it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live\nAnd she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special but uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just it's on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a bill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told them look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S MCA and its works good but we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just had to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nMany jobs and talking to my Everytime I Can't I'm actually talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs which don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products are there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal and they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent of the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country and the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states so it was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they show Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and in ...\nDuring early voting from ...

Trump and say this is a bridge too far you can't sexual ours our first lady\nFor commercial benefit and get away with it which is the late night topics of cold there and the Jimmy ... you hear it constantly sexual ... making fun of the brilliant first lady we have millennia Trump\nSo how is it worthy of constant unrelenting criticism when a porn star is called horse face by the president but when I first lady is depicted as a stripper engaged in sexual acts in the oval office\nThat somehow that it's not worthy of being covered\nAnd that's the other first ladies do not envelop her in fact have you seen any efforts by Laura Bush or Hillary Clinton where Michelle Obama to spend time and to make more legitimate interview with the mainstream media she's legitimate with me millennia Trump who is by far the most brilliant\nFirst lady we've ever had she speaks five or six languages she's wonderful\nBut the media will not allow her to be the president's wife without sexual I sing her calling Aaron ignoramus doesn't speak correctly doesn't speak the English well enough for Stephen Colbert bear who makes fun of her on a constant basis\nSo if we lived in a fair country with fair media you know a media calling balls and strikes\nYou would have criticisms against those in Hollywood and the entertainment industry\nWho wants to sexual lies and make the legitimate and minimize or first lady throughout the world and you would have the other first ladies the other flowed is is coming together to say stop it don't do it can you imagine just think for a moment\nIf some country star\nFour or five years ago sexual allies Michelle Obama and put her in sexy outfits performing sex acts in the oval office but shallow bomber\nWhat do you think the view Kobe or Hollywood the New York times every big city newspaper every\nBaggage Zeenat they still exist websites would go absolutely crazy this would be the worst thing in the world to make fun of and sexual lies the appearance of Michelle Obama and it should happen I Want the same behavior that\nWould apply to Michelle Obama do apply to a lot of the Trump because they're in the same category doing the same kinds of good things may today\nEarlier today millennia Trump plane filled with smoke on her way I think to Philadelphia and she still made the trip this is a brave courageous woman who's married to a great president but the media wants to make the legitimate both diminish who they are and make them objects of scoring and ridicule\nBecause it plays well I guess what the audience there was an audience out there for this\nYou know about fifty percent of the country loved the guide fifty percent load the made him the dislike and the hatred for Bush was nothing compared to this\nAnd so I'm waiting for the apocryphal see the stop\nAnd for the news coverage to begin\nOne more big our room it remains was to\nIs no federal judges there is no legislation there was no federal appointees there's no new attorney general it's over\nThinking about that\nI'm following the rules that the producer gave me [laughter]\nWell that's what John thanks for your call let's move on and Scott in New York City it's got a New York city welcome to the mark ...

same ideology\nThat that they have today about um you know bringing out here to the country\nAnd he works for the Saudi royal family for years as an editor on one of their papers so he has a history

that\nBoston Globe her hometown newspaper quote Warren reveals test confirming ancestry NBC News nobody but Clinton network NBC News quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she is Native American heritage when you break down the numbers\nThe testing that this person did involve samples from Columbia in Peru not from America\nAnd that she is something less than point one percent

group\nAnd your Louis Farrakhan using hate speech against Jews Twitter went up and you if you're in the group like Brock Hussein Obama and you admit in the presidency\nUsing drugs committing felonies

does know what a normal mother or father would do to protect their house or a normal person would do to protect their business I mean this is no different than\nPutting a lock on your door having a fence around your house having a ... a alarm system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do your gear up\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up\nTo protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing is protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\n\nNow all of this I said to go back to court point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this filling in for mark before or many of you know me I I play tennis in college I was almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a another nation they both came to this country is a student with a student visa legally\nThey didn't break in and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell\nThey love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break into your house 'cause I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\n\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation sets\nYou you know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing\nWith an evil nation in Saudi Arabia again he hasn't\nStood with them he said we're investigating we're taking the time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out\nThere will be a very strong response from this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't terms amount of actions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media is treating him with this caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and is an outrage enough to on this one story but then they say this president being outrage over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's on hand she's a terrible person should calm down it should be loving which one is it\nTo the media which one is if you want a president that defends his country and fights this country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care of adding to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing its thing he's ... he's crazy and he's mean and evil and he's so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts\nLike journalists are somehow more important than average people I'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing a normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come and defend and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you know I've been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure but they just allow women to drive and the only reason when they limited drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia\nI didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb they will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut off ... ... feet\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify with Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't
