I mean I've done five books now on on these phenomena foreign them at in black and one on the women and black and\nI have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI on and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking ... you know go on and skins live ... white white\nUm and people talk about how they seem to have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nPay for the even talks about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right after paper they using wage of bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe this the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I guess I'm you know I'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the use animal relations are carried out by something other than just um\nUm humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or rather investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... you know you've got a really weird lungs and exploit couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain the recent powerless demanding black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the\nGovernment agencies are responsible for their mind they but I think it's a very small cats are great but says they the January unexplained ones and the way it was what I think is happening on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually it employed the legends of the men in black as a means to cover their tracks in other words the maybe paper within governments who know that many black all too real but\nI don't know what they are but he doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the ... the most chafe resumes too to threaten and quiet people who move I may not want to have them talking about cases so the government may actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't think they do fully\nThat sort of leads us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction ... with the government doesn't want you to know that ...\nLatest book or whether or not you believe the abductions are real the\nFiles one alien abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the ... documents that nicotine squeezed out of the U.S in the

we're talking with the red burn a you know there's an old joke about paranoia paranoia ... but something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean somewhat isn't really following you around it's sort of the the the inspiration for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction piles\nYou talk about the world in which we live where mass surveillance\nIs sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately yeah and of course you know\nSubsequent generations\nDo growing world wherever I've never known any different you know I'm\nRight paper the night before the Internet age will remember\nThat was not that sort of worldwide surveillance that we have now and um you know I think that's what I Am fortunate things for future generations it's going to be helping normal thing for them and probably accept it as well\nOr you know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to\nTalk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and it'll be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways but in fact they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things so that's the word alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what ... alien abductions are all about that that idea which seemed preposterous are too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYeah I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually official publication guy to first of November ... people can already got it\nBut I'm the reason I wrote\nTop secret abduction falls is because over the years I collected a number of official documents on abductions which are painted classified for the fame Information Act in the ...\nUm the U.S some primary I was in a position where I could actually sort of put the book together you know provide the raid with yes it's another book and I started going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present paper with the guy just showing falls or be put together now\nOh the book actually with the contact a movement of the Nineteen fifties which preceded the abduction phenomena by just about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would\nGo so to speak but um\nGovernment agencies do ah put together falls on paper to claim to have had\nA man and Kansas for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George finds hassle true and bathroom or feel Angelou chi all of them had FBI falls open on them one of the main reason Spain was because they claimed when\nI'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and see Israel eons but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or government is very different two hours and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes\nOf the FBI to the extent that for example George finds hassles FBI file um he's extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm over ... she was about four to and so on so you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon\nWith the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacteria and Bonnie hill case which is I guess the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote a book on the case they interrupted journey now in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get waited a they don't fail writes\nThe you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd they get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British\nNational archive and it revolved around among Ronald wild man\nWho was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and he was like the early hours of the morning to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the call started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomena within you follow gee what's intriguing is that they\nThey uh British police force actually handed over the investigation\nBecause they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British will laugh or schools told they have\nPromised in security services are sort of like the the James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that what's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the\nThey ... they promised and security services interviewed Ronald wild man by the same time too with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect is that he told the police and this is a direct quote but he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction little in today's world that Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about it it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was ... at the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact these and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of bemused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you have a hard time taking them literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts men or that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate\nA public opinion is that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... ah first book flying saucers a blended published in the early fifties that\nThat sold him huge figures are gigantic numbers of books for sold 'em and a ... he went on to like just a it's a little around the country\nAnd he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly had this sort of a call me and this type of governments on the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file honor dams skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the\nWe can we live out here do you\nReally really and

the total dollar amount of\nLosses or a livestock losses for ranchers and farmers could be but it's a pretty substantial\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the FBI\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\nWell I think you know the the black woman clearly a real one\nThey just seem to be tied to both the abduction phenomena what they know and I think there's probably some true today\nLying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that operates outside of government you know it may actually it may sort of do research and work for the government\nBut it's not you know the CIA or anybody like that ... I don't think I think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and\nAnyway she took 'em there and she never could turn out to the parents or anything like that\nSo she took them in and raised in Missouri on and uh they uh when they got in their teens\nI noticed that they didn't have any hair on their head on anything but it wasn't a Bon Jovi where they had moved out the ... and ... she took them then they went to school and we were fourteen years old they are stuck out of school because they were extremely intelligent\nAs a matter of fact it ... a built a Kevin ... there's no strong raped by late summer and um they um you know like you say very intelligent boys both with twins\nWhether any of that um when I when he was about sixteen Seventeen years old got a very bad a cut on his own detour farming action that\nWell they couldn't do local hospital and they ah it felt like they will have to lead transfer you can cook it lost so much blood but when they took his my tight they couldn't find any type of matched ... anyway and they check to a place and then they checked his twin brother and he had the same lead type\nSo any of that they had to use his blood transfusion lean re they went back to the phone and nothing happened and they went into the army they drafted in young the Nineteen forties to\nWhen they came back from the army they went out in the swamp and a um ... ... let's say that there and they link town maybe once a month for supplies and so forth but then they had set up a ...

out like that and he couldn't figure them out any advance are they missing and they they never heard anything from even want to\nThank you for sharing that story I'm going to get ... take on that Thanks John appreciate your calling Nick have you heard that one before anything like\nThat story but what I have heard all kinds of similar situations where you know ... in within the family was known but um\nYou know what the grandmother you know back in the thirties or forties long before you know the whole model to review college he took off that that were abduction like experiences ... fan in other words it's not just something that began with a bacterium bony heel case\nIt's just it's just a case of trying to find the earlier ones and very often that does come through you know what a family member decides to\nTo contact someone like me you know and and share a story that goes back to you know the Chinese or the fifties lie about one so I'm you know I think we can push they the

missing but it looked like they were attacked and according to many people in Russian uh yesterday I don't know if your guest has any conclusion to that story was uh\nWhen I log house yet I outlook

circumstances and I'm\nA ... to ... to this day I mean there's everything from\nLike violent big foot type creatures attacked and killed them or you have sort of Russian military experiments UFO activity and despite all the research on the top of several books have been written on the subject there's no\nSort of one hundred percent consensus on on what actually happened it's it remains you know ... but there are a lot of\nWeight aspects to this story which I guess unfortunately you know we'll never really know\nThe answer I think it it's going to remain a mystery unfortunately\nNick I don't know how when you sleep but you are you're a as a prolific an author as I Know in the world or any one I Want to talk about anything else you got coming up we got about a minute left\nUm well as I say well you know that's the new books a top secret abduction falls that's the one I'm sort of a you know promoting narrow I'm I'm not as I said the reason I wanted to ride it was because he has to

in religious studies from Harvard University where he studied religion and culture he's interested in religion and science spirituality at ... church religion new religious movements electronic media and popular culture and there's currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other worlds\nSpirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending a Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're gonna catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] give me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right um people um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of how my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this on the move here in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how are these sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led a um a lot too and at least a new vocabulary that people are you now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interesting spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with the puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still in America seem to have a lot of\nI guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they are pretty high numbers in America um believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation and traditional relate with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about that how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real sense of relief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation in traditional congregation so if I tried to think about and\nTrying to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi verse was thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of odd mystery and and wonder I\nThink those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard times too late ignore me\nGeorge it's too late [laughter]\nYeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort of that you you'd sort of reached out look and look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions in the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about\nThat and maybe I can just say worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes you know I'm going to have a\nAnother ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um since Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and wet\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter] and that there's something else as the tricky part something else is the\nIs the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimensions reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive I'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In a\nWay back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and\nThe reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that they find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that uh the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just to skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um\nAnd I'm so happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to [noise]\nYou know think about the possibility that above our free spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um\nThat we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration I some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and uh they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get

in that song there are men have got to feel at home in the universe again and I I Believe a great deal of the despair of our time is due to the fact that men meeting people of a false picture of the universe and our destiny having lost religion and gained nothing in his place\nToo many people have come to believe that life doesn't amount to much there are several people who are profiled in the

about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah he and his wife is is quite a story um but you're right they're they're ... and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the um you know sort of like out of it being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer and brave\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his ... am\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual low level or worlds to reality I Am headed into an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make the right and the situation is he he embraces map addict and geometry as a kind of a\nHe kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty onto him but I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he develop\nOther than the book he developed the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he is very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nThe book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know sometimes give talks about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that [noise]\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get one of things that can happen or does that happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be\nIn some other reality and then they come back and this one outside audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some other experiences as well also in that chapter six I'm\nNot a little bit in the chapter on here Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer a wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a fact of that book but she talks about time flipped from and and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise] so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on as as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear or something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that prime flows forward\nUm in fact so you know I find that a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called up a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block prior we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defending future's all those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions Scott defending wants to look at it just got to my book but you can also look at Brian Greene book he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that's the kind of questions that you as a professor religious studies tackle all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how we are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lifted itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should start ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nDreaming felt he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment and Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him than and higher space last or is there um that's what he believed to happen in some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we could talk about that as a as additional facial dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and have you thought everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that everyone if they ... kept a journal by their bed\nOf their dreams and and they follow you had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believe that if everyone did it they would be able to see that all of the all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and confidence I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences want to talk about say onto a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we've discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for visible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away takes us into the break you\nKnow you can show up dates with other ... fans would you joined

of flat land where this uh summer hire dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to the world pulled them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached down and grab us and pull it up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and the and habits book a flat land so\nYeah people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as as kind of the higher dimensional objects that than themselves into our world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific yeah that is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have people who have let's\nSay these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experienced like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics I have different voices in the book I'm\nTalking about what the meaning of\nThese events are ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of insider intuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences and so on\nAnd and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like\nLike all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right to have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went through\nAnd he went to sort of like popular science book um\nAnd I think that you know that's one point I tried to making the books I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nAh well I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah\nYeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right on ... reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um\nAnd we talked about dreams earlier I think a through dreams and you know in the sixties and other times you know Americans used psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into\nAnother realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the chance to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely there are all different all different different methods\nAh so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that isn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell\nUm let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other uh parents came on an\n... ads higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because [noise]\nYou know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in and flat land let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and\nAnd what do you see well if you're a flat square fighting around on a flat world you you actually\nDon't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle and he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every everyone and flat land and just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled\nOff of the two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly\nA he suddenly has powers of vision that he never had right he can look down\nAt flat land he can see for the first time not just lines that he can see A People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see he can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines\nHe can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle 'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he could even see inside the trial like in the inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nPeople have used to say a ha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power the vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire dimension we look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look down on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out\nYou know you could see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside of one's body you could see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um\nSo you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision um and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about\nWhen you go on a vacation or any

that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nWell Marsha I just wrote that down I'm going to give that a try next year the suggestion that dollar [laughter] from the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\nI'm also I'm prayer will open the dimensions a live show in a two king six is sort of them was frightened by the Syrian Army that's surrounded both him\nAnd I shall pray to God to open the eyes of is serving his sermons eyes were opened in other words he was able to look into another dimension the\nMoms were full of horses in chariots of fire and you couldn't call to serve in much more than that\nUh as far as other worlds if you go into he bruised won it talks about that God created the world's and that's the plural formed also occurs in chapter eleven so there are dimensions out there uh the Bible talks about them as being the unseen\nAnd also there's other worlds populated with intelligent life so I mean now also um if you know you're talking a little bit about we gee boards and um the Bible tells us specifically in um ... ethics minded dead known nothing and we're not to get involved in Nick romance seat\nA San says any of that it didn't work out too well with um\nKing saw when he approached the which should end or the next day he and his boat\nSt John do you have a question for Chris\nOh well I'm just saying that you know you want to practice prayer is a very good form of meditation and uh we're promised an axe to Seventeen that job will open up our ice and real prophesied despair will move on\nAll ... all religions All right but thank you I appreciate the call appreciate it we're going east of the Rockies a dog in New Jersey I doubt\nThat morning how are you know whether this evening good what's on your mind\nOr is it was very is there a newly hit a practitioner maybe there's something you do before you go to sleep to help you um uh out who are prepared to uh uh be able to remember these dreams or how to ah make them more loose it\nI don't know that's a little Christmas is a Christmas tried that has any expertise but we'll ask him\nThere I mean gun in his book I'm On dreams doesn't really talk about uh preparing yourself at night although I think there are other\nFolks out there who've written books about how to remember your dreams who do actually you know say things like you know\nTalk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dreams on so I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down on as many details as you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice\nYou'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrian Adrian sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said\nUm you know help people remember more and more details as you go through the process so that that is pretty simple technique but there there are there are others out there who talk about um dream and dream interpretation\nThanks dug up going to take a call from a this was a first for me from volcano California the caller is Brendan good good morning Brennan\nMorning what's on your mind on about is a street paralysis so I keep having episodes where I'm\nI'm I'm I'm just a little bit I'm suffer from insomnia so when I get on these worldwide all sleep\nConsecutive days very well it seems like after about five or six days of this but\nI get on this trip where I'm falling asleep on my body is falling asleep when my my mind's away I guess they caused the process but\nIt's almost like I go into a different universe and there's all we've seen that I see and usually are trying to get me\nAnd pull me out of my body and not only that I hear them they talk to me so I'm I'm curious on what your thoughts are on is this just ... you know might just listen to any like\n... Internet or ... was there the doctors will say or is this an actual dimension that\nDuring the state of my body is and I'm able to actually I don't wanna say teleport but you know something along that lines into that and it's very scary yeah\nYeah yeah right at all I think I can recall\nYou rented let's let's let's Christopher respond thanks Bernard for the call so does sleep deprivation lead to other realities I Wonder\nYeah yeah um well he mentioned the word sleep paralysis and he also seemed to I thought I heard him say consulting doctors are with computer there there is a category of sleep per hour from there are\nThere are things that happened when people are falling asleep or waking up in the sleep proud has thing as Gary ... is a very common\nYou know people wake up and they can't move um [noise] you know and it can I think I Believe it can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so [noise]\nYou know uh get the question is is is merely a a physiological biological um\nIssue or a problem or is it somehow opening the spiritual world I guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is you know these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness I'm\nYou know they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology\nBut um it it could also be um an opening to\nOther realities of the spiritual reality or maybe I don't know you know in some cultures um in some cultures you know people have visions um [noise]\nUh that that can be traced to you know brain chemistry or some sort of a from ... from ... aspect of their of their biology or the brain chemistry but I don't think that rules out the possibility that you know their particular use your brain chemistry as it off or\nYou know and it was white thank you very much appreciate it I enjoyed the book it's called other worlds I Hope people will check it out thanks also to him earlier guest Nick Redfern and we've got his the links are\nPosted on the coast to coast website and thanks to my colleagues there at coast a Michael co CEO and Donna Walker ...

logical community\nYour turn their heads away from these kind of phenomena so um you know that can be problematic but um I always tell people I mean if you look back in history [noise] um you know he told me being a couple of centuries 'em\nBefore a lot of recognized animals where was found to exist in the first place so I think it's important to remember that it's um you know there are surprised

back when those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or um something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA as an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell in this book about something called the winged man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah I run a plea um that was in a place called the kind of chasing central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid\nSo I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a woodland let far Iceland\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be to the hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of ... just the same you know they become known as window areas where it seems every fit in each brother comes through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody had seen this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use over the woods I'm at a high speed um you know kind of a like a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police older [laughter] I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou know ... that's the I think that's the responsible way to do is to sort of look at the day to and and share rates and that's what I Do I put the diatribe for people to say and if I got out and says I tell people if I don't have an says I'll tell them you know they said that\nShe's a ... or ... or or possibility\nUm [noise] you know I'm not going to tell people that big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of the moon\nWhich [laughter] I don't believe that date by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called bats watch and you share that with this\nWell yeah the the the ... is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees that more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up is not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people are like what was the fact\nAnd then he's never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan\nFailed um he saw these strange ... he was driving along the road and it was sort of\nHumanoid with this huge wings\nBut it was kind of ... as well [noise] scares me and how the shining a yellow eyes but they sort of the ... the hair angle\nCombined with the large wings um you know the the the hat everybody in the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he caught it looks a bit like\n... and I'm I'm from loyal in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I'm going to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now on on these phenomena foreign demanding black and one on the women and black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI on and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking\n... you know go on and the skins why why why um [noise] um people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nBefore they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women and black of turned up in homes right after paper being using wage bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe they ... the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I only got ... you know\nI'm asking it into context ... with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the use animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they aren't humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or rather investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... you know you've got a really weird ones and exploit couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain the recent powerless demanding black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the\nGovernment agencies are responsible for that might be but I think it's a very small cats are great but says they the January unexplained ones and the way the ones\nI think we're going to have occasions and there is some evidence to support\nIt over the years agencies may actually unemployed elections demanding black as a means to cover their tracks in other words it might be able to think of them and know that many black radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't event\nFrom using the legend a moat hey\nAs a main too quiet April or may not want to have him talking about that is so the government actually not know how many black really are and I don't like to fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't want you to know that ... latest book\nUh whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on alien abductions are real

that doesn't mean somewhat isn't really following you around it's sort of the the the inspiration for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction files\nYou talk about the world in which we live where mass surveillance\nIs sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately in of course you know\nSubsequent generations\nDo growing world wherever I've never known any different you know I'm\nRight for the night before the Internet age will remember it was not a sort of worldwide surveillance that we have now and you know I think that's what I mean I'm fortunate things for future generations it's going to be helping normal thing for\nProbably accept it as well\nOr you know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and they'd all be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways but in fact they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would put time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things so that's the word alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether\nOr not the government understands what ... alien abductions are all about that that idea which seemed preposterous but too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\n[noise] yeah I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually facial oh vacation guy first to November people can already got it but um\nThe the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I collected a number of official documents on abductions which will be declassified for the feed me from ... in the u._k.\nUm the u._s. and finally I was in a position where I could actually sort of put the book together\nAnd you know provide the ready to leave us it's another book on Eileen abductions bus instead of going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present paper with the guy just showing how falls or be put together now I start the book actually with the contact a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomena by just about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak but um government agencies\nDo ah put together falls on paper to claim to have had I been unconscious for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George finds hassle true and bathroom\n... all of them had FBI falls open on them one of the main reason Spain was because they claimed when\nI'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and sees would I aliens but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or government is very different two hours and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes\nOf the FBI to the extent that for example George finds hassles FBI file um he's extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm over ... she was about four to and so on so you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon\nWith the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacteria and Bonnie hill case which is I guess the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote a book on the case they interrupted journey now in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get waited a they don't fail writes\nThe you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd they get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British\nNational archive and it revolved around among Ronald wild man\nWho was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and he was like the early hours of the morning to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the call started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomena within you follow gee what's intriguing is that they\nThey uh British police force actually handed over the investigation\nBecause they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they\nPromised in security services are sort of like the the James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that what's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the\nThey the they promised and security services interviewed Ronald wild man by the same time to with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect is that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing that goes that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction law in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of felt a bit strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking\nSort of amused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and winter Venus and things like that you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government use really does followed them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts men or that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers of land they published in the early fifties that\nThat sold him huge figures\nGigantic numbers of books were sold 'em and a a dump ski went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type of governments um that communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on a damn skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with a million bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the communist angle and I'm a number of the the contact chase I'd sort of similar approaches for example to get him the K\nNineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of the lectures that I wrote to each other back and forth were opened and sailed back down with type and I'm\nNow they can clearly be done you know a family without making it looked like the ... I was taught open race failed it was almost as if\nWhoever was doing base wants to Greg and call it ... know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it\nAnd that went on you know for for quite a period\nOf Greg is working tonight at our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the you up all the old who you know I'm not as credible is Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know that there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an alien abduction then I think sometimes people can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know\nAnd which is a dangerous road to go down um but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many papers so Shiite that we've ...\nI'll tell you what were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side are saved some time so people can ask you a couple of questions that we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons I like Seventy one\nDuring the ... the bones have been ... ... ... ... ...

Redfern tonight a in a moment we continue our conversation about his new book a top secret alien abduction piles the very real X. files about abductees and weird incidents such as capital mutilation and black helicopters\nAll that conspiracy stuff has is grounded in fact and we'll get into that a just a moment and save some time or a couple of your calls and questions and comments as well be right back [noise]\n\nMethod you ... if you're considering going back to school I felt so following questions do you need the flexibility to take classes and your schedule you have college credit to

cattle and horses and\nDeer and uh other ... other kinds of creatures but a cattle or the the ones we know best that have been publicized most I Can't imagine what the total dollar amount of losses for livestock losses for ranchers and farmers could be but it's a pretty substantial\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the FBI\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\nWell I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and I'm clearly a real one um they just seem to be tied to both capital mutilation and um the abduction phenomena and\nOne of the things as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that phase\nWhere ever flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organized fashion that up right outside of government you know my actually my sort of do research and work for the government\nAnyway she took a man she never could turn out to the parents want or anything like that\nSo she took 'em in and

running out of time here with ... on the payroll\nThey um they said the swamp and or some people are at the same because they hadn't seen in town any of that they were missing they couldn't get anywhere in the only thing they could find was rocket cherish carry with some ... some rock\nAnd they called date for college women very you came out like that and he couldn't figure out any advance are they missing and they they never heard anything from even want to\nThank you for sharing that story I'm going to get ... take on that Thanks John appreciate your calling Nick have you heard that one before anything like\nThat story but what I have heard all kinds of similar situations where you know ... in within the family was known that um you know what you have a grandmother you know back in the thirties or forties long before you know the whole ... narrow view ... took off\nThat that were abduction like experience he's ... fan in other words it's not just something that began with a bacterium bony heel case\nIt's just it's just a case of trying to find the earlier ones and very often that does come through you know what a family member decides to\nTo contact someone like me you know and and share a story that goes back to you know the twenties all the parties like that one so I'm you know I think we can push they the barriers back significantly you know when it comes to when this whole phenomenon actually kicked off\nTrying to get one more call in the first time caller Josh in Toronto hey Joshua ... read from\nYour evening gentlemen how you doing All right thank you and your mind\nYeah basically had something on my mind it was in Nineteen fifty nine case if nine Russian student hikers who went missing will not missing but it looked like they were attacked and according to many people are rushing a yeti I don't know if your guest has any conclusion to that story was a\nLog house yet I outlook yeah\nYeah the ... or ... stories and interesting one you know it was um [noise]\nYou know a bunch of Russian papal um you know where it together with friends and um\nDied under very all circumstances and I'm\nA ... to ... to this day I mean there's everything from\nLike violent big foot type creatures attacked and killed them or you have sort of Russian military experiments UFO activity and despite all the research on the top of several books are being written on the subject there's no\nSort of one hundred percent consensus on what actually happened it's it remains you know ... but there are a lot of\nWeight aspects to the story which I guess unfortunately you know we'll never really know\nThe answer I think it's going to remain a mystery unfortunately\nNick I don't know how when you sleep but you are you're a as a prolific an author as I Know in the world or any one I Want to talk about anything else you got coming up we got about a minute left\n'em well either so but you know that's what the new books a top secret abduction falls that's what I'm sort of a you know promoting narrow I'm I'm not as I said the reason I wanted to ride it was because you have to pay a lot of books about abductions but a book that sort of actually addresses\nFate of any information files on everything from abductions to missing time to black helicopters you know it it presents a new angle on the abduction issue if you like\nThank you Nick it's always great to be here when a urge people to take a look at the new book and also the monster book it's a great one to have your library if you're interested in these kind of subjects always good to have year thank you Nick\n... thanks electrode and coming up something that uh that uh might put a different perspective on that kind of subjects we talk about on their show it's a whole other world

in religion and science spirituality and on church religion new religious movements electronic media and popular culture and is currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other worlds\nSpirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending a Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're gonna catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] um no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences what whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality but as you know this on the move or a new direction by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how are these sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to it and at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\nLimiting a around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that uh that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still an America seem to have a lot of\nI guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America\nI'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about that how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real sense of relief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and try to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multiverse or thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and the Braves with ... with offensive on mystery and and wonder\nI think those concepts just sort of uh the the bed for for new spiritual infections and I and I um and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time relating normally charges\nToo late [laughter] [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out look and look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I can I ask the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about a talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm ...\nAnd the ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or mentioned three facial\nMentions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um since Einstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world an on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talked about an additional spatial dimension [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw the line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional object has length\nIf you then draw flask where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and wet\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and height and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter] and the the something else as the tricky part something else is the\nIs the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive I'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members of the\nEver wrote the book just the kind of encourage people to\nYou know think about the possibility that above our three faces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um\nThat we don't see we go through our life I'm thinking that our world is the only world\nYou know may maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil so in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment are

white other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions there's a character who's a explain named Jay be Priestley\nI wanted to share a quote with you because it's sort of flows from what the Robbie with singing about and that song there are men have got to feel at home in the universe again and I I Believe a great deal of the despair of our time is due to the fact that men meeting people of a false picture of the universe and our destiny having lost religion and gained nothing in its place\nToo many people have come to believe that light doesn't amount to much there are

reporters\nPeople who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing terrific come in and you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she is very good at it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic\nApproach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist

believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah\nYeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King to hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nAre [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words\nI have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC

teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... ... it's more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or\nOnto a supercomputer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots\nThat third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime and I was reading some of those sanctions in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once in a book and there's not that big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do we how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture\nThem and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really\nAbout what's going on right here and right now even as we speak in ... in labs all over the world or I'd tell for example the story of Ilan ... are being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so\nThen that's where we go with the next ... the classic study

of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book\nIs ah is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving a physical life on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles that at all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trait\nAnd we're drawing a traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were to find the natural order of things and he got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine I it was very Meyer and it was for a merger and right yeah and we all know margarine is not so great for exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against\nYou know a billion a court in the science you know billions of years of\nRight where we need to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the de ... thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back to quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not\nOh he's doing the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means ... who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuits are feeling a industrial secrets and focus on but he recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church\nOf artificial intelligence\nYou know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory where now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robot Howard by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we\nThat they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side\nBecause he did that this technology we're creating\nWill run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs that say you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go you\nKnow ... you\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we once posts about being very good at that well you know like you they're ...\nButton it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small but you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and I think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine so\nI like that the cushy Murphy app yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose it you lose a\nYeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that said you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer [noise] now how ... easy with that the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up

I Know several people who have a ...\nWho have a trouble walking or they lost their ability to walk ... spinal injuries and\nAnd the this to them as a dream ... you're just being able to walk across the room because of a of an exoskeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three ... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess but we're\nYou would that one no I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement a called the trans human movement where as you say the ... the idea is to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I\nBreak it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was the power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms to the vet them right off\nNow here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms\nThat he can move with his thought so they're they're wired\nTo his mind and I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton that I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just it it you know so so for a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella Scott what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but neither seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nI mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's what it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see that politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death\nBy having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but [laughter] and inevitably it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right and then I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead\nTo what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I quote him in the book in Russia is\nVery upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not shoot another word to give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat's basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight you know ... in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we had our just still the same you know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you maybe the biggest problem we would face in the law of\nUnintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism you know\nYou know I mean that's that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ...

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the least looked into it and his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found with a woman was wearing these woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the ...\nAnd they found out that they they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at the husband he ended up being charged with murder ... this kind of a Internet of things that are fine on every aspect of our life that can tell\nBabies and that was I remember that yeah yeah they they won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't so I mean I think\nSome of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing in science journalism in a book like this is really helpful 'cause it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a ... right and you write up after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that\nTime so it's a bad since you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason yeah\nThey um playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be on the on the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] I think you can you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the revelation that talked about in mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance fine\nIt says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this area that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is\nYou know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of ... of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... it will\nReach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's in the form of a big computer server\nOr it's in the in the body of a among careless or a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and soul yawn ... you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like the sky net running it's\nLike running on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the horror from saying or from the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting on well you get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that it's a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a kid more elite dishwasher six so ... ... ... those exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject\nOf immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always result them so keep that in mind let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast am David\nGoing hey my question for a minute or so ago and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah and then or if they do we just lose him and we just lost [laughter]\nOh no Well James is in the in the Washington loose trying to him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh I enjoy your show but uh I've been on any kicking machine going on forty five years yes er here and I was a bank or do generation I'd like to know from your gas to remove pills that these two will\nBe overcome through ... or or a maybe a genetically modified pigs I'll take my answer off the air and\nHang in there James hang in there James we need everyone there you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine as\nHe's on dialysis is on ... and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's fight with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her\nFight if they'll not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're\nMaking enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second\nGeneration a that will help actually restore\nSight the people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these by merit a there's a lot of great research and I've reported on on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cells\nOr ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended

long I I started out listening to art bell and I've tried to call in a couple of hundred times this first time I've gotten through this is such a great privilege it if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible a\nAnd there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline uh\nAny discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be ah the Bible for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a drink and the and the Bible as something to be studied and pondered over\nThree of the model the aesthetic religions from the middle east began their roots with the Bible and and polluting the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the Newton is in the New Testament to the current New Testament yeah I mean\nThe the story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods\nThe story of Jesus in the ... all of that validates not counting the historical values a historical cruise you know that that line up\nWith a so many of the stories in the Bible or many of the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nOf the historical value of the book uh Daniel is so accurate and ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future as far as he did but\nThat that Cruz when you look at the troops there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much for humanity\nYou know oh I agree I agree we yeah we stray\nAway from that and people and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right that's terrible whole book or you know and they'll a skilled in\nAnd you know it's called proved texting and it's yeah it's there's a there's an old saying I've I've said it before I go ... but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was\nThat some people um some people rely on a on scripture I'm like a drunk leans on a lamp post not so much for the looming nation but for support\nAnd I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a um I I was writing I wrote an article about um about\nThe true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told and I was interested in how many troops um how many murders stories there are in the Bible and that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that\nIt starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murders stories still do what I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus they where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible in the New Testament the Greek word says kill\nBut actually the word that's often used uh the Arabic word is the Jesus who was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about him in a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out\nYet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity has a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to\nBuild a\nLegacies you'd think that that has hurt us and gotten us away or you are from the central message of the\nBible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God and I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter]\nI'll take the bullet in protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know people go way far onto their way to create these\nStructures were there shooting people killing other people in the name of God and I uh that's where I

as we know it\nOminous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel the no prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked it uh at\nA later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think an elite group\nOf science reporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing terrific how man\nBut you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she is just very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future\nIs all about this what else to be a great gift for for Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family and ... and but I mean I what what is the science\nThese days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life ... eye and say try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA a thing as a human vacated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I Walk with me had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories are and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in a sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto it very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robot\nThat third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in the near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nI tell for example the story of Iran ... are being very very involved well you know he's involved in Dr ...\nThen that's where we go with the next ... the classic study so much so that the pope wrote fetus at

instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book\nIs a is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about that that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of\nMorality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like ... whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trait\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow were defined the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you know don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for us but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're\nYou're fighting against you know a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we need to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back to quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy your beach or something that people do by flipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about\nSome of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the phone but\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence and\nYou know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect\nGod because they know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because\nWe want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYou know ... you write in artificial intelligence now can beat the pants off her you know the the goat champion and so it's pretty that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just anti adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we want spoke about being very good at that well you know like you

I Know several people who have a ... who have a trouble walking or the law\n... been spinal injuries and\nAnd this to them as dream ... do you just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three ... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess\nA but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that yeah the the discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement are called the trans human movement where as you say the uh the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I\nBreak it down into three categories as the usable a trends human augmentation there's so there's usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was the power lines when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms to the zap them right off\nNow here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we're mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you\nKnow these are these are arms that he can move with his thought so they're they're wired\nTo his mind and I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I'd tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you\nKnow she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and maybe even end um [noise] even\nIn the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there you know where you know write it just it just it it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but neither seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death\nBy having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then in ... new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight you know ... in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we can are just still the same you know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ...\nAnd yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war\nBecause you're over welcomed by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ... you know I mean\nThat's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for some term in there but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nUh and his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story\nAbout the the scientists want to put a a a a new head an old had on the new body\nRight yeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those\nHalloween he kind of moments right there were like All right now there's this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then\nWhere does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up they the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered in the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how they came in\nHe killed he killed his wife in the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang on to that thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the ministry\nThe end of life as we know it might go Guillen next on coast to coast am in for George ...\n[noise]\nMy name is ...

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I could pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing of the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculated how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they they won't have soles God didn't make them they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't\nSo I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful 'cause it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right and you write up after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book maybe totally irrelevant right because by that time [laughter] beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason yeah\nThey um playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur defense and ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] I think you\nCan you were talking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the revelation that talk about your mortality\nAnd when the wrath of God is or out of a finance fine it says is that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible\nThat might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is\nYou know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of ... of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... it will reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence bean whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a among careless or a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and soul yawn\n... you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like the guy net running it's like running on on\nEnergy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the horror from saying or from the crush souls of the people\nIn stumps on on you know getting on well you get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that it's a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a kid more elite dishwasher six so ... ... ... it was exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations\nBut it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast am David\nYeah hey my question for a minute or so ago and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good\nQuestion [laughter] yeah and if they do we just lose him and we just lost [laughter]\nOh no All right Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh enjoy your show but uh\nI've been on and kicking machine going on forty five years yes er here and I was a bank or do trend ration I'd like to know from your guest or when we feel that they too will be overcome through CRISPR or\nA maybe a genetically modified pigs I'll take my uh and throw up here and\nIm hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\n... what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine of\nThe ... years on dialysis is on kidney machines and ...\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nI'm the they're making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her\nFight it's still not crystal clear she can she can make out fate than it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are already working on a second generation\nA that will help actually restore\nSight to people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney from I don't think we need to create these by merit a there's a lot of great research and I've reported on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using them so\nAh ... it would create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very hopeful\nThat is where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and for your joyful spirits and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next on coast to coast likes to\nPlay there you go again by the around the wait I didn't mean by that\nI just wanted to know what I mean it's all about you I agree with Alexa Kim and share like

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year so they have intelligence that it's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla\nEt cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different and one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever\nBut we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no familiarity with the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old Fred ... who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\n\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on us and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find an archive news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what\nMaybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so but again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer from the Watergate church\nWas coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explore notes that\nThis thing came up to him while he's on his horse and look them either I actually spoke to him large hairy by pat he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with a ... church butter de saint church\nAnd it's in there so to say that these things\nHappen happen with ... with\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge here Hubbard being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on a about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fellow over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this and uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right\nUm which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a stunner I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of

I don't remember where it is in the in the book but there was a an incident where somebody's camp fire\nTheir camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just kind of playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things doing an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water um it\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match\nProportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well must be young kid the attitudes are different\nDifferent reports to a generally not hostile shy when they get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big boy that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on pick for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that pick for was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the fall on on books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get them or just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people and I I Would have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there\nAre references to these huge Wildman carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though you know no\nNo and that's a that's the tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't they name there and if somebody's writing about it since it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him are apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nSo this is the part that really really unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm\nAnd I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that they may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them in this well I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in a wall Mike how will come back from nowhere completely though\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] then\nThe same man told them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me\nDon't turn around get back on the horse or get back on my ... a TV and leave and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got their\nSo called jobs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I recall I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big what milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and\nDifferent kinds of groups um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer terror there an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the\nMiddle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound deer native could have done it and\nThey don't know how it got way up in the tree and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast it goes to a um [noise]\n\nFind out more about two nights gifts to log on to ... am dot com [noise]\n\nTwenty four hours making team divergent somebody's\nTrying to say I'm Sorry I mean are you if you listen or just sent in size actually gets you argue is my first shady at ... am liberal colleges we have one\n... users either anymore it's reality t._v.

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take film or anything while\nThey were in the wilderness with my new topic about today\nNobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a big foot in the wilderness for a minute to have like they got on a PG ... day there's probably pushed one hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrion ...\nWhich has the ability to catch that so I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the person film is real\nWhy haven't we caught the spy on film and that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven there was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot stay there\nBecause every other time they immediately run they all look at the camera like this one did they won't hang around and lingering knowing the people were watching him something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back your skin Walker day but it the the comparison is pretty clear is that that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nIf you uh had activity in one area and set a camera up it would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it attached to it\nUm the description from the tribes the you mentioned in your books suggest this thing has camouflage abilities that he can poke itself the change of shapes and it can hide\nCorrect that's again one of the reasons that makes her different topic cope research\nYeah I mean we see it when it wants to be seen I guess yeah\nTry to get one more call in Tom in Vancouver up there in big what country Hey Tom are you doing\n\nIs Tom on the ... fellow\nI think Tom has gone ah okay so we're about out of time to have a great work or the title being sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty two does that suggest that another a book of archived articles about these sightings good from some other time\n[noise] [noise] well not really no I ... and just so everyone knows the book that contains the actual article rewrite for the articles this is the real deal\nNineteen twenty was cut off point for copyright criminals article oh so by more than\nYou could print them after them you can't because they're so for\nA while it's a terrific a piece of work uh I Love reading it I I Want to go back and read it again because there's so many details that escaped me as I was preparing for the program but I I said some of the writing and this is just terrific\nAnd it's always great to have you on the program and I don't know what your sleep but I Hope you're taking care of yourself\nI'm always I'm always eager to be on your show Georgia and and the response I get from being on your show out of this world good so I appreciate the effort you put into it\nWell thanks very much I appreciate it and maybe we'll have you know get Melba catch them back on here some time to talk about that DNA stuff that'd be great\nOr I ... just again the big for a while bend a giant is the new book check it out if you get a chance at the moment we shift gears to talk about the true story of the worst the disaster in us naval history and the fifty year fight to exonerate an innocent man Indianapolis coming up momentarily we'll be right back [noise]\n\nNever missed a DJ on a show just sign up for the ... ... email newsletters relief for ...

the worst disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced and award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nHe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nHere from\nSarah like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nOr actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of the ship to a single line which was the ship that carry the bomb in stock\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter] imagine that and you know\nThrough looking to what was available at the library I still couldn't find anything so I I Hope someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it though I\nYou know I thought out what I could that thought you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it and you fast forward graduated from college and no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I thought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to me of the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was a\nKid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so yeah they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visit them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the clip notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and great misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very high and high tech from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I pray that might work and I had been praying have an opportunity to work on an iconic over story\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive I get this email from that young filmmaker and a lot it\nWell what they didn't say about her journey with an apple is with that I'm ... I'm going to have a story tell her she wanted to render the story as it rained play and she actually said that she wrote an part little ... than to and major\nProduction at home when we found a brother\nThat we only they when they are even\nThough you're getting ready to train ride or I don't know how to raise a family and friends theories that and contact with ...\nAnd I'm no number one that I'm a veteran now that I I've been trying for an opportunity to a story that's like this one um\n[noise] and my only problem was is that also wanting to fight and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] ...\nThat I had to figure out how to manipulate or in a way to help her but uh eventually over the course of several men finally met\nAnd then a green could work on it together and they didn't really get started in earnest of twenty four and then when we get a project and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to write a wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the that did people had who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a mall part of that um that was definitely\nOf what I wanted to tell but really I mean that major objective of it with to tell the whole story of this shit you know she'd been reduced to thinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent demanded\nMost of the Pacific war and the campaigns that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise you know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did\nA besides being sent [noise]\nBut I'll tell you grab me ... my father was a an open now and he ... he drove a landing craft from uh the ships to good troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about uh the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to ah give us the version that did you guys would help uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned ... was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle if that's an hour where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was protesting sitting in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the state full journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nAnd what we tried to do with you even who recognize it even though men were at any time that they were all acting out of your content and doing what\nI'll tell you what we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ...

somebody\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Lynn Vincent I interrupted you before the break we you're about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYet a commander ... lieutenant commander ... as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use the ... um\nWell it was it and then more sports that he had left after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and Japanese language\nAnd it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from commander had him at his point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted in Indianapolis\nBut because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality alive he was a commander who cared for his men\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on death and submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around banging on doors asking for radar and more technology for his that marine because that means that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his rather than commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nAnd there was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening\nBy that point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nThe shark ... attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on their back you know from sharp to shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them there's one account you have the sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs thinking oh there's food I'll just reached out and grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young intern by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off and thinking he was going to wiggling toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are uh happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah the everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before and then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a\nSixteen rats between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's\nRight so so there were so any water that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in in the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not\nTo drink the salt water no matter how their God but there were others who\nAlthough they knew that the sun and the measure and the the hydration itself with perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one toward the water through it into the into his mouth and thinking that that would drain the folk out well of course it didn't and then other when you know take mall heard is that the water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gold thing it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called hyper ... and\nBlood vessels bird\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander a who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it without a site all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it'd sunk quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who winds up testifying at the court marshal later\nA un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who would have been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight and\nThey the the you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is true or something of that nature but yeah I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times and yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they\nHis son who you know this gentleman Richard ... to have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the when his father and it did line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after\nWhen were released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda incidents are a lot about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but so there were survivors and uh what came next is equally amazing we'll be right back\nFind out more about tonight just going to go to ... stadium dot com\nRound on why\nSeventy five Paul Simon issues for solo album still crazy after all these years gone at last\nFifty ways to leave your lover and the title track all reached the U.

things worse is if things just sort of dropped through the cracks that made their survival you've been more improbable\nWell at their mentioned there with the um\nDeparture methods that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there with the tenant Philippine I who had read the the thing that\nA ... a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well\nHe wasn't the brightest guy in the world\nAnd that as a matter of fact hadn't received to report thing as match that he thought well\nIf I don't have to report a rival that shit I guess that means I don't have to report NATO rattles either and then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the pending invasion of the Japanese island\nSo all of these things along with the lack of a stretch signal combine to make it in Indianapolis but crack\nAnd it wasn't until a PD one inch or a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when um it happened to be flying over the area that the survivor's on it in the water\nThere was a very poignant story you tell in the book Sarah ah about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and trying to ...\nYou have these uh guys in the water or something you hang onto their they can't do any more there are other supplies they have to hit back and there was one guy who's swimming way up in the middle all by himself just swimming is if I don't know where he was swimming do or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left in your plane to help this loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to any of these men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take it for you know our ship or else the VP is the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carry till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time is when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and a lot of big stuff going on all things did fall through the cracks but uh [noise] is it an accident that the story was all out of the newspapers do BJ day well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the times did not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred beginning on August second uh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August\nFourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth and fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil v J day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines you know Japan quit the war is over\nAnd then maybe below the fold in a very small articles USS Indianapolis cruiser sunk\nAnd reporters that time believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was you know resulted in the last of almost nine hundred men\nOn the very brink of the end of the war\nSooner or talk to me about like captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and saying was the court marshal inevitable let him slide given that the war did or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families\nWho lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is a tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know [noise]\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating this in the streets but there are families now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who is involved and who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one new thing\nAnd that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nAnd a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented the situation\nAnd so really you know\nAt the time these names the you know admiral king and ruin the limits and all these these men who were essentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nYou know the the American public you know holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom and have them testify in tarnish their name like I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was\nBrought to cart court marshal there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little is to talk about the court marshal or or mentioned earlier uh the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commanders to testify that had never happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain that he failed to zigzag than the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two churches um and not only was it unprecedented to bring in command her how she invited to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all\nFor having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels son captain Charles McVeigh was the only captain who was ever court martialed\n[noise] excuse me and I'm\nSo glad he did have to charges against him one was and by the way the navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college and so forth and we found these records where\nThe navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would stick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lights of the Pacific war who were involved in this you know the the commander of the civic forces the commander at Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global sea power\nAnd admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admiral our theory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into open court and so that's why they were casting about for something that would stick with McVeigh and so what they charged him with was\nFailure to call a band and shit in a timely manner which was quickly disproven because there were a lot of witnesses who um heard him call abandoned ship and then heard it passed man demand the second ship as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned was failure to think that\n... was an anti submarine warfare tactic worship which they're back and forth across space course\nHoping to throw off the aim of the Japanese said commander\nAnd indeed had to make they did see stick as these ... evening twilight or just before the ship was sunk\nBut the standing orders that the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion um and then when commander ... testified at the trial he said\nThat he would have stuck to the day whether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference but he was testifying and Japanese through translator and the translator did not\nTranslate exactly what he said uh correctly and commander ... could understand enough English to know that but not enough to really repair the damage and also he was you know\nIn this very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either but I'm In\nHay fell a sports fans that Danny west that I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history are back in Nineteen sixty four for the

news I think it was last year that the ah Indianapolis had been found a there's a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the some commander of Indianapolis and you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship\nI didn't know what he was talking about it for the way of [noise] and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before the petrol group which has the vessel that\nYeah even uh even the cap and didn't know what it was that this with\nThe most closely guarded secret as the entire war and the most highly classified naval mission of the war\nAnd so even a even as I said even the captain didn't know what it was only major from and what it was and his uh his companion happening fame now when it was along to monitor the radiation so\nThere was a little chance that a Japan would've known and I don't know that extra precaution with taken\nBecause ship with traveling so fast almost at thirty not that they cut it out ran any Japanese submarine that were to try to target or\nSome funny stories about speculation among the crew about what it might be a because there was a fairly conspicuous package that was delivered there and in fact as you noted in the book the the the uranium the\nThe radioactive part of it ah element was carried on to the ship in a briefcase but there was a lot of these stories that we are told about what might be in their right though Sarah\nOh yeah I mean again these are teenagers and they have this large crate that's delivered which is really a diversion to everything but they brought you know they see this crate come aboard and it's surrounded by a marine guard\nAnd of course there first gas is Rita Hayworth undergarments or scented toilet paper for Douglas MacArthur

to blame somebody in the ship itself got blamed a and all of which you would like to tackle that\nWell they were in effect blaming\nIndianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship so they were saying that that was happening they followed that with the ship fault for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm

missing for one one series of books\nAnd a documentary film by that title in fact ... was here last month to talk about the latest in that series broaden his uh his Web is net and his uh focus again\nOn the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project but one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project\nA groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies you learned as a police officer\nWho the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist to get accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time\nWell you may have been focusing on missing for one one the last few years but never lost interest in big foot so eerie is with a new work gets an archive of big foot and wild man stories and news reports dating all the way back to the year's sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\nHey George thanks again for having me a\nAbsolutely no good\nTimes on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] [noise] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it did you I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last say seven eight years focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on the first pages of new news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like ... when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big foot Wildman and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when you were first year you recap the ... project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains to the earth\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of fed acquaintance I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar and counter and they said you know if you have Twenty years of police officer you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially I said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research on top of graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the hoop of police that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you could break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness to come forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nMany of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey you can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples so tell a story for normal\nWhen we come back we're

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied them year after year so they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever\nBut we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles uh\nAre made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows how's Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a snake long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone so uh I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you've made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find an archive news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what\nMaybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so but again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where and explore from the latter day church\nWas coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explored notes\nThat this thing came up to them while he's on his horse and looked him I'd I actually spoke to him large hairy by Ted he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with the latter day church latter day saint church and it's in there so\nSay that these things haven't happened ...\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventy sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black white mass landed in a field releasing a huge error covered being that we're seeing briefly and disappear now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nA big what people who think it's an ape just crazy\nYou know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a book on about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that go shit topics I'm doing research on and what I read this all over for a while I don't think anybody's ever heard of it\nAnd a book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with you a topic that I did on this topic\nStarter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and uh it's a tremendous book

it\nIn in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt these look like human\nFaces these are individual basis that he's drawn a\nDrawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that the general consensus that a\nThird of matches what other tribes dated all across the U.S and uh\nYou try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to find a group or an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson gambling film and it's you know people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that's being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures at the beginning is that that that you're you have drawings up and this and the beings that are described in the\nIn in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nOne I did a good one film and wanting Harvey has the ability yet if let's say somebody goes in to a bank Rob the bank has a beard on as a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving\nArmy has an ability to take the here are the face I can see with the face looks like so you can identify the perfect\nSo apply that to the powder and get one film Harvey took the hair a face a ... bike it's in trouble for it and it doesn't work like a native uh\nAmerican man\nI guess the argument could be made in probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female\nThat are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members\nOf people from northern Ukraine of people from China and I put these pictures up there\nAnd it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you were a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but there was a an incident where somebody's camp fire\nTheir camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things\nDo an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy when they get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big boy that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on pick for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought the big for was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the fall on on books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge Wildman carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the name there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said\nA friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him are apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nMontreal Canadians set the time of his retirement she was the leading defense men and leach history was two hundred and Seventy goals [noise] this week in Nineteen sixty seven the New Jersey Americans who later became the New York and New Jersey nets played their first KBA game and jumping ahead this week in Nineteen Ninety three\nJoke Carter heads only the second baseball World Series winning home run\nAt the Toronto blue jays when game six of the world series to beat the Philadelphia Phillies games to two\nAnd I can still remember every fossil moment\nYeah I'm a Phillies fan that your heart radio weekends porridge time capsule\nYou have an old car taking up space be a hero and support our nation's veterans by donating your car to the Purple Heart foundation your car donations\nSome people still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just settling well how about settling for the skills\nThat people still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just\nSettling but when you think about it I\nRemember thinking mum had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower which spot in trouble before it happened well now it's on us to protect our home and family\nWhen you meet a veteran [noise] you're meeting a hero\nWhen you donate your car to the Purple Heart foundation\nAnd spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's why parents trust blink blinked video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home is like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or wire free set up and minutes and run on to double A. batteries last up to two years brilliant technology\nWendy what a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after easy in ...

two authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court I'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nHere\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb in stock\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter] imagine that and you know\nThrough looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I I Hope someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could say that you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and you fast forward graduated from college and said well no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to meet the men\nWho survived Indianapolis and\nI mean yeah I was a kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visit them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their story teller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very tight and project from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an eye on it for over ... story\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive to get this email from this young filmmakers when they're flat it\nWell what they didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm going into an apple is a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote an eight part series and the two major\nProduction company and they said hey this is the ... on the other\nThat we only they carry on foot\nSo you're going to be the right stuff she thing right or I don't know how to raise a family and friends the race that and they've contact with them\nAnd I'm no number one that I moved to veterans and know that I I've been praying for an opportunity to a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all the with wanting to fight and I wanted to help rewrite the book [laughter] [noise] ...\nThat I had to figure out how to manipulate or in the way to help her a eventually over the course of several months we finally met\nAnd then a agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest and a twenty four and um and then when we fit it OK project tickle me and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the that did people had who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely part of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective was to tell the whole story of this shit you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well\nYou know everyone's got to know what it incredible shift is less than what she did\nA besides being sent [noise]\nAh I tell you grab ... my father was a at open now and he ... he drove a landing craft from the ship's took good troops on to the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that that you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned ... ... ... ... ... ... and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know that he was the fact is at the battle if

I mean it's kind of moment of that whole situation I don't think so I think the iconic moment is the one step for man that's another one yeah yeah I mean there's a couple yeah but um but we now uh now I have not seen the movie um but there's a couple of articles that are out talking about the flag and first of all the flags all over the movie\nI mean they they think insight you know Fifteen twenty examples of the flag all over the place in some of it is like the just the patch or yeah which would you kind of understand would be really obvious if they would not even only just that for example\nUh apparently they don't show them planting the flag into the moon however in the scene you can see the flag planted in the moon in the background was already been planted there and they show it somebody they're avoiding the flag they just don't have that moment not good enough what if those forty year old women or they're not like I said how to\nAgain there was there already is someone else comes and\nThey get there a couple of bottles or short innate you might not understand that but I mean are we not just the\nVictim here of of\nOf the budget the outrage it does not seem to be a thing no it most of it's not most of it now\nThis okay today there's a tweet from Donald Trump oh did he say something crazy of course they did is a tweet from Donald Trump today we're also talking about a war in Elizabeth Warren's Cherokee heritage\nWhy why he does this matter I mean you know again we have to Saudi Arabia thing going on that it's much more important I mean not to mention that we're going to hit a trillion dollars in debt again for this year\nAnother trillion dollars in debt there's no sign of that letting up despite the fact that we're in a good economy were were were popping out a trillion plus on the books when unemployment rate is almost at full employment\nWe're almost at the peak of our employment situation we are at a point where we are the stock market despite a couple of bad days this week a has been raging for a very long time\nA housing prices are up everything you know everything is ... pointing in the right direction and we're still throwing a trillion dollars on the fire\n[noise] I'm just put this up this new banner from CNN\nThe disappearance of journalists puts spotlight on Trump's business ties and that he is because candidate Trump talked about uh doing business with the Saudi Arabian yes he's talked about that for a very long my gosh are you kidding me now\nThat the only reason why they care about the Saudi Arabia and say forget about you forget about gas prices forget about the economy forget about the tech sector forget about all of that\nThis is just another way for them to talk about Donald Trump don't play that game just don't play that game\nI Wish I cared about anything in the world as much as CNN cares about what Donald Trump tweets\nI mean there are absolutely chemically obsessed with this man they are it's it's incredible they are chemically addicted\nThey cannot break the bell\nAnd unfortunately the one who loses in that is them\nSo how do you manage to separate Saudi Arabia from the United states you kidnapped and killed a Washington Post writer they blame it on the Saturday and you will encourage Americans to react with outrageous those crime against read or the breath of quote turkey ever pull off the subject like this you at\n... or want to have a history of deception two thousand sixteen ... to get a parliamentary majority would approve a new constitution making him a dictator for life but he fell short of the majority so what did he do he pretended that the Kurds had attacked and attacked Kurdish villages viciously that'll ever taught all the Kurds out of the parliament\nAnd to increase the proportion of his followers and the legislative body that was not enough to give him the power that he craves in July two thousand and sixteen\nThere were the who wants to see him he took advantage of the emergency powers to toss over a hundred thousand people who didn't support him out of their jobs at the jail tens of thousands of them but who actually perpetrated back cool\nI suspect it was or to want to himself\nHow could eared ones darker forces have created the impression of a murder that would separate the Saudis and the Americans\nFocus on a Saturday writer for the Washington Post\nThat's an interesting theory Howard Bloom will have to keep watching this one thank you\nSo have you ever taken ... listen to this story over technologies recently received proposals from Wall street banks\nValuing the ride hailing company as much as a hundred and twenty billion dollars in an initial public offering that could take place earlier next year and that's an amazing story\nArchaeologist and Italy have uncovered and inscription that they say may show that the history books have been wrong for centuries\nAbout palm pay historians of long believed that mount Vesuvius erupted on August Seventy nine eighty destroying the nearby Roman city of bomb pay but now when in scripture and has been uncovered dated mid October almost two months later ...\nWell this year more than half of all the United states have confirmed or possibly ... possible cases of acute polio like illness that can cause paralysis and mostly affects children\nAll those thirty states said that they had cases that were confirmed suspected or being investigated including Fifteen states that said they are confirmed cases in two thousand Eighteen and total forty seven confirmed cases in forty nine more were suspected are being investigated\nFor a total of Ninety six it's bizarre story Dr Gary right now are with us scary what's going on here\nWell George this is a real mystery tonight uh this plastered paralysis is been around for three or four years in the United states and it hits the voluntary nerves in your spinal cord not up in your brain\nYour legs your arms your face your fingers or swallowing and even your breathing can be paralyzed\nAnd the average age is about seven and a half years and they've noticed that comes after an acute respiratory infection in the late after in the late fall\nAnd it doesn't look good any good traces the spinal fluid and some of the children show a virus called eighth of a new one but not all of them have that most of them have clean spinal fluids and they don't know what's going on right now they said our chances are one and a million of getting it\nHowever India has had fifty thousand cases over the last couple of years what cuts are right down to one\nIn ten thousand\nSo what we want to make sure that it's not coming in and it's not going to come here but the\nProblem and here's what we do and it seems like it is easier\nYeah we don't know the cause why is there an increase why is it reported in countries all over the world who's at risk what are the long term effects what's the prevention and most important what's the treatment to this infection\nWell that's good it's scary though Gary why does it affect just children apparently around it\nMay it may be a because of the the respiratory virus that was out last year called de sixty eight really hit children are very hard and put a lot of the hospital and they noticed an association between severe respiratory infections in children and uh the acute flattered paralysis\nSo it's usually a you have to watch out for is that about a week or so after a coup respiratory infection\nOr the children started getting weakness in her arms and legs and you should get him to the doctor quickly to have them checked out for this\nAll right thank you Gary today in Canada has become only the second country in the world to approve for recreational purposes across the board\nThe use of marijuana Oregon he is the other countries amazing stories all over the place up next we talk about one of my favorite writers and producers rod Serling his life working imagination next\nOn coast to coast am\nHey if you're buying gifts for somebody you really care about you know it's a difficult task you trying to understand what are they like what don't they

the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately you what was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he's the one who probably pitched it to the network ...\nAfter that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see\nThat kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say a rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write your collections of short stories\n... sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up the night gallery movie or they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nI'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nIs there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nOr is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're gonna ear and\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are they can be re Andrew reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't around surely one of the co writers a planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a so he did get coal credit but ever since\nThe movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was that gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he\nWas a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe he had that he really wanted to believe that you know the alien had been here you know a thousand years ago\nAnd he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff but he was also a very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you'd never saw a spaceship or\nAnything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies\nA rod narrated some very popular ah documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search engine astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of and during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever\nYou know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials that's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often a complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story and twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he\nUm he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah as you said if so they're so different it was very hard to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction and fantasy to western comedies to you know it went across the board so um you know I you know I\nHave a couple of favorites you know just a you know to\nThrow a couple of my favorite at this point probably as it's walking\nDistance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know really this youth and go back to a easier less stressful life was that the Willoughby\nOr it's just like really as kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its well distance yeah so they\nBoth very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme is or was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was a classic\nA man is absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still note to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that stuff\n[laughter] ever [laughter] and then just so many good the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and starve to ever\nFlown who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater or he start in that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nAll right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas per ISI about some of the older type television programs check in with us next on coast to coast they I'm\nNever missed a detail

competition\nUh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know and you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would I Would say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it\nGives to ah to writers and creators that's you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS CBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nIt's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look\nBut I've always been amazed at what I was able to do with regarding the size of this sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer or the lighting directors which I just\nI was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was ordering from Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that it that's one of the striking things about the series is is\nThat you know of course the production level in terms of budget you know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of thing so they ... had\nTo work with a you know more a relatively modest a set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern um he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make\nYou know young actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like eye of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we got kind of got the budget back under control\nHe jumped started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to be Robert Redford yeah yeah has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first\nAppearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was very good in that too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show and Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders\nAnd and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spill person you know a sense a few things\nWe found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery a because everybody thought she was ugly in a she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode or certainly wrote that one and uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and\nThey turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically a vote on episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nI I you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally or at least ... years later that was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas ...\nRobert ... absolutely right another great and you know great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to half\nHour I'll rarely yeah okay\nYeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episode and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nUh and so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a yeah helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah yeah cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead I\nMake a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seems like it was very escapist were then maybe someone stay back in the sexes I'm just speculating if you had to write for a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nAnd I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really light that my second question would be about\nIs down\nAnd for

struggle with those shows that ... day and\nHe had a time machine you know one of 'em this guy or you know way back in time three different times and he thought he would try to prevent that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that while he failed at one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that\nSo I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany but already thought he could alter that event\nCourse but a man I don't know we it it'd be hard to say which me my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story\nThe guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store and the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine\nWhen he got a break from the department store you went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was to grow up man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down he went and a back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts instead of a you know empty cans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story you know and the guy that Rand a department store\nThey found car well given these gifts out at this a place like a John ... mission

oil Santa Claus he raced in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it to Mr gundy\nHuh you know said merry Christmas\nAnd both of them got pretty pretty toasted on the wine and they walked outside and they seemed Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer\nAnd arrows society and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned

that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked at a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut\nAnd ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out things usually working life\n... ... that's true but people of color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball cards from the Nineteen fifties I don't know where they are I've asked my mother who is eighty nine years old mom checked the ... where are they she says George you we gave them away\nWhat I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle card oppose it was in great good shape your real good shape right what would you ... well suppose you were at a tag sale\nAll right you're running around out there in a city angels and you come across an old old house I hundred years old the coup all out there and as a

Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cars have been worse if you'd given them to him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value of very much and probably it would hurt the value you don't want to do that with a you know you're better off having 'em sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff so they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really\nI always think if you do a little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right here where everybody's on the baseball card that nobody's buying football cards which means you should\nBe eyeing football\n... interesting to\nWrite basketball cards\nI once saw a guy who had a complete [noise] he had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called a big plate he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie guards on\nOh I don't know what the heck that the work that day she's managed basketball\nCard but nobody collects football cards and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be buying it get yourself like addict but his rookie cup Dick Butkus card right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think I threw away a wholeness Wagner card was worse than they\n[laughter] they have a an artist Wagner

history\nWhen what makes these collectibles so expensive and so he's on after\nI always say you know the way to make money in and take the jets instead of sitting around and saying well this is rare this is exceedingly rare there's only one of the world and it's obviously a four hundred years old the\nWicked dusty it is right that's not the kind of what makes things give things value is what I call marketability\nAsk yourself who's going to buy it you know everybody loves baseball\nGot its an American the love baseball one of the reasons Mickey Mantle baseball cards are worth so much as it

how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nHundred and ... and I know that three of them for example it's a good life in praise of long distance call with that guy Billy ... who was a kid that scared everybody into the cornfields\nFilm or feel to them that you filmed episodes do and so if you take that up a notch and make a color than to get done you're completely in another universe and you're not for me you're not in the twilight zone anymore\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately yeah what was his role\nWell he he created that series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery it was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\n... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence\nCome up all the time in episode where you say oh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did right and you know a collection of short stories\n... sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually the stories that made up the night gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um some but she never\nHad the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThat there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out or ... or early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nA is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're gonna ear and\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay\nYou know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be ... re introduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't rod surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it did he well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written\nBy Michael Wilson and rod Serling a surgical credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what did you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift\nShe said that he wanted to believe he had that he really wanted to believe that\nYou know the alien had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff but he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or\nAnything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated\nSome very popular ah documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of and during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever\nYou know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time there were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often a complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he\nUm he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said there are so they're so different it was very hard to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction and fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so um you know I you know I\nHave a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as it's walking distance\nWrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know really this youth and go back to a easier less stressful life\nWas that and the Willoughby or it's just like really adds a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its well distance yeah so they both\nVery similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that with a big theme is or was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring them to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh Fisher man that was a classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that's ever [laughter]\nAnd uh they're just so many good Leo what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a effort Sloan who actually started rod Serling is very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yet exactly he was he was against gambling and he got kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nAll right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas ... about some of the older type television

A. dot com\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back then it varies you with us rod Serling his life working imagination ticket for a rod Serling were alive today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\nWell I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restaurant was riding obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there's so many shows that are that are\nAre so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think it would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he there's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but\nUm but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I could tell you for sure he he would hate reality TV on the um\nHe and and I don't say that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television Ford's time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody\nOnto the show in the normal you know regular everyday person and they will trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the the show or you know he thought it was just the invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality though and he would hate but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill an old time television to Nick are really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking older white guys [laughter] where did the television you know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him\nHe was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um the field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know help them you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to ah to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nAnd it's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look\nBut I've always been amazed at what I was able to do with regarding the size of this sets which to me it was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer or the lighting directors which I just\nI was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was ordering from Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that it that's one of the striking things about the series is\nIs that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest ah set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern um he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room\nBecause it was going to be cheaper to make you know there is one room and that's it\nAnd he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like eye of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and\nSoon to be Robert Redford start yeah yeah has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was her that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series is it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spill per se\nAnd you know a says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery or because everybody thought she was ugly in a she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else looked like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yes that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi I you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally or at least ... years later I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas do you\nRather devolved absolutely or another great you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half hour oh really yeah okay\nYeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episodes and it it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nOr in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has a horrible horrible incident a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral\nStarring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA as yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead I\nMake a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seems like it was very escapist well then maybe someone stay back in the sexism just speculating if you had to write for a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nYou really can't Nick we're going to take a quick break them we're gonna come back with final phone calls with you a special guest Nick ... book of course has

Christmas Story the guy that played art Carney\nPlayed the Santa Claus in a department store and their car car well was his name he wanted to be the biggest ... times the guy was a law Shariah\nWhen he got a break from the department store he went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the cheers little boy jumped up in his lap\nThan it was just it was too man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down he went in the back out and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bags of a sudden became full of gifts that did it you know empty can\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story you know and the guy that ran a department store\nThey found car well given these gifts out at this place like a John ... type place you know at least when it comes and goes where did you get all these kids to get a receipt for all these is Bob Bob and he goes no I just\nI found the bag and shrimp and I'm just giving them out to the PlayStation and the department store owner came a nurse yeah air there it is there is a merchandise oh well you're the Bob are by you know and the guy's name was Mr done department store right and\nAnd they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty can write and they're so they had to go and of course store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen scratch it couldn't figure out where all those gift recover from it they were coming out of that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he raised in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three\nAnd add to Mr gundy huh you know get married and got pre or post it on the wine and they walked outside and they think Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer oh and ... and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans and remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in the twilight zone feature film as well about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the residents to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again by plane kick the can and\nAnd the one person who was against it the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become young and he regrets it obviously and and that that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually that's a terrific episode\nWe're running

right now and uh does an awful lot of good for the blind and for a students who need scholarships you know\nIt sure does how did you get involved in the collectibles\nWell I got involved in and takes away a lot of people do I just failed that everything else [laughter] not really but\nYou know I I was a middle aged guy always in a restaurant business I was a stock market forecaster\nI used to that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked in a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut and ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out but when things usually working life\n... ... that's true but people of color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball cards from the Nineteen fifties I don't know where they are I asked my mother who's eighty nine years old mom checked the ... where are they she says George ... we gave them away\nWhat I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle card suppose it was in great good shape your real good shape right what would you ... well suppose you were at a tag sale\nAll right you're running around out there in a city angels and you come across and old an old house I hundred years old big coup all out there and there's a farmer and I just sold the house I I'm just getting rid of the stuff so right away you got a feeling that this stuff might be a legit\nOr that tag sale where some facts you guys can outsmart right right you\nLook around and it's all real stuff that's been handed down for years you see a fifty two man told their and excellent condition ask them a few questions you find out it's right a guy says listen I've been told that is where the porch and I want ten thousand bucks for it by the by it\nI don't know I don't know until I call a guy like do you\nWell that's worth a town somewhere in the neighborhood of a you know two hundred thousand dollars you know yeah oh\nI had Alan Caroline's mental saying Willie Mays I haven't had 'em all\nTo myself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally you had like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie cards slum\nI ran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cards have been worse if you'd given them to him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value of very much uh probably would hurt the value you don't want to do that with a you know you're better off having 'em sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff are they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right everybody's\nOn the baseball cards that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be\nEyeing football ... interesting to\nWrite basketball cards I once saw a guy who had a complete he had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called a big plate he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie cards on got\nOh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth today jeeze banished basketball\nCard but nobody collects football cards and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be by you get yourself like a big by his rookie cup Dick Butkus card right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think I threw away a wholeness Wagner card was worth anything\n[laughter] I did have a an artist Wagner card\nDid you really do not like a million dollars isn't it\n[laughter] yeah it thought two million if it has a a a a a Piedmont back\nGosh yeah that's that's the most famous uh collectible and history\nWhen what makes these collectibles so expensive and so after\nI always say you know the way to make money in antiques just adjust instead of sitting around and saying well this is rare this is exceedingly rare there's only one of the world and it's obviously a four hundred years old the\nWicked dusty it is right that's not the kind of what makes things gives things value is what I called marketability\nAsk yourself who's going to buy it you know everybody loves baseball\nGot its unamerican the love baseball one of the reasons Mickey Mantle baseball cards are worth so much as it sounds like Mickey Mouse\nYeah you're right by

government and maybe they get it maybe they don't\nA you know no interest or a minimum very low interest like ... maybe one and a half percent or so just enough to cover the costs of administering the program\nWhere does the lending money come from that one for the for these loans\nWell the money is used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer 'em and let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of\nCrony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who at this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans\nAre exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fared collection practice laws\nFederal um a fruit than lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam\n[noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swampy belts\nWay ... ball of bankers are which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a\nSponsored entity back in the seventies [noise] uh and by the way one of your other guest who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when the company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprises\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at\nEvery interest in making money off of this system [noise]\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very disturbing also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] uh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living in a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhere do you recommend for a parent who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give it at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they where they where technically it is called a student loan\nBecause soon as you call it a student loan federal or private\nYou lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treatment lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections but I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank at a private line of credit [noise]\nUh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan\nWhatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding has cetera can keep up with their budget\nUm you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee ... per year\nThat's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer tapes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane storied where people are graduating with you know a million

journalists ...\nDot com and subscribing now for universal access across all these devices that us\nOn TV all access trusted for over Twenty years\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans skim what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three ... in um\nI graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for a short amount of time uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera uh but what I fell into and what a\nProbably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to fall and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me in my lungs very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government we used to be interviewed I might add a and so it was sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later [laughter]\nAnd Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change and very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to be a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy is an outline that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that kept the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lender\nAnd who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them\nWould just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know [laughter] uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans in particularly as you as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who were born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because they're credited shots and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very rural\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about\nI mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people who you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the lending system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs breezy eat greasy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earlier is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nAnd there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and\nYou know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that scale and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition\nBy working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college well you know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge tile and good thank you\nGeorge got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big signs they throw support the sealed their\nFate or he left right after you hold that thought\n[laughter]\nI Love it but uh anyway I I I Want to drive a little bit of trades will do a ... a former company I used to work or I got trained on egg wildly\nWhen a company went under the under the ... the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I helped her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without doing well and I think also for ... years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nThere and I looked at the local schools they were to forty four thousand dollars just to go for oh I I think it was up to her horse\nJust don't take well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going out and I spent thousands of dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive\nAnd then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that I could have done it for about half the price now they've been\nA let's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools well\nYou know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon

they in in and around consolidation ... read the action program and I'm kind of concern and right now I'm On a ... based repayment program\nAnd I have no idea what that is that that was going to ask if he had heard of it is comedy or and\nIt was like a scam Jimmy Allen doesn't it do you have student loans out there gene\nI Do I Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can ushered through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that or or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger loan or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir how they're\nGeorge it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nA job thank you and I hope we hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold this ... this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the uh uh costs that I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the video he tried to negotiate with these people have there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a few\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would\nI Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the get alone he'll take it a fall dude you know that's something you you can do but certainly dealing with a very close to me like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting to the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are zombie loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and you\nWouldn't even leaders down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they all they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent particularly for older loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nPromise not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens in the Pentagon homeboy

that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you\nGreat job indeed aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off and leave and taking your credit Graham a cat but she can take July is that story and and really to\nTry and one document tree Patel as as fast as I can the entire story of US government don't want any relationship with this phenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation the UFO community I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nBy and I would say this wouldn't I is that the vacation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades to know the U.S government did have a UFO program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm an Asian feel that the day and and you're like hey for years they said no no since project we ... we haven't been doing this with no in traffic or no investigations\nAnd of course they were\nAnd that's what I really focused on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tango the numerous threat to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk\nOf mistreatment both the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid charmed along I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff because it's coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer to that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely and meticulous detail because I think the problem with the story in one sense\nFor years people have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the eight story with with these revelations\nWe almost have too much information and I think the public I mean it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just the confusing man if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nSixteen last year and then the the three videos came out to a than a than a third one but now the public have been absolutely bought it thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this guy and then this millionaire businessman\nAnd and the struggling to see how it all fits together and say that that's what I've tried to do to take that back and and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course tonight it leads up the Pentagon but tell us specifically about your rule\nWell I took a lot on on on that one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seat and then you've done this of course ... time his health you know you sit in the ... said a direct tech kind of talk\nTo you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question I when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I go edited down to a few soundbites and\nYou said put that but at the end and I wish they'd taken it out and I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon ... did they fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so scripted the entire movie I ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to camera and in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike alone I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that same\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure for mayor dates a completely\nNew role to me I I there are people of course who are used\nTo this sort of thing uh people like Jeremy coal bellicose just made a a a great movie but um you know only I was a departure for may so took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with\nFirstly I as I say really to try to\nGo through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that\nThat this field has is\nIt we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go ahead on to all the platforms\nThat the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but too young to get people and and another thing\nIs you know it's been a year since ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did ... or you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon don't want to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you say the organization I'm E. E. T. I.\nRight yes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has had forty two ways says in these sorts of situations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission\nIt still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going now other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nAnd there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] yeah and and it it it's frustrating and a thin because and and it's almost ... clay ironic in another way that that you know you have a bunch of people\nIn in the ... the the the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in a proper scientific manner and we come up again skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect um\nBut that skepticism isn't the soil to Nicole\nOr intellectual\nA human that skepticism that I think most people I associate with that concept it's actually it it's a\n... probably trying to do the trick been skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the end picking 'em\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic quality just in one sense it's swapping one on your plate fringe belief for another so we'll these ... these people were skeptical told\nThey would believe that they would you believe us in some some great Warren happen with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back and chat more right here on the coast to coast or you\nKnow you can you show up dates in tune with other ... would you do in the ... stadium Facebook page just go to ... dot com slash goes to go see him and the like button [noise]\n\n\n[noise] ... was very very big surprise\nVote coming November six in the mid term elections you search\nAnything is stages job down\nDesigned for information right now\nSeven Ninety\nNow a year in rocks spotlight Seventy three November Seventy ... second album use a minor\nEighty thousand dollars signaling the downfall of one of the most of the police criminals Nineteen twenties and thirties\nBegan serving his time the U.S ... century in Atlanta but amid accusations that he was the leading the system and receiving cushy treatment he was transferred to the maximum security lockup Alcatraz Island in California San Francisco bay he got out\nEarly in Nineteen thirty nine for good behavior like my health problems for the rest of his life component died in Nineteen forty seven and eight forty eight at his home these island Florida\nThis week and I used to be a Chevrolet began to sell a car truck hybrid city calls emails amino inspired by the food ranchero which already met on the market for years the el camino was a [noise]\n\n[noise] but I never heard them ringing\nNo one never heard them into\nThe will to [noise]\nAh well in the sky but I never saw ...

of congressional hearings would you think could happen it could happen when\nI'm I suspect now it will be next year because of of course we've we've just had the bruising judge Kavanaugh um ...\nComing up to the midterms but as I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee and the house armed services committee have been looking for his ... ha it\nHave been doing and secondly I think that interest has said wait until the white a question of you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy para I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of of the uh science technology and space committee and the space\nSubcommittee that could actually be a little bit of a don't fight about that I mean that's another point if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolves into formal congressional hearings the question arises will where should those hearings the\nAs I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the\nThe space subcommittee or the the science technology and space\nMain committee I think I think it will be difficult to get it away from the middle of tree frankly it was a a military and intelligence program and I I just can't see how you would get it\nOut of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks and it terms of reference about unconventional threats will if ever there was a ... a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it's ...\nSo so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I supplied some briefing myself and I've certainly set that might be I'm happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things\nWhich I think is is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been\nFor a national daily newspaper reports that have actually gone into the fight but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know war all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nAmong us one us no not yet no\nNo thank God we do what we do and we have so many good pot jesters out there doing what they do to get the word on there\nI absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunate play only got the chance one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself ah it it's kind of like like we said with a million of penned again\nYou know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes right you're right in documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles and this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\n... yeah I absolutely as they all have to be these days and and my my article in the guardian basically\nUm I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee and House Armed Services Committee interest and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it it's it's staggering but have before articles\nI've seen about this all four of them a great ... one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line or I'd love to see a survey of twenty five to thirty in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course all of the age where I like a hard copy a newspaper in my hand and when I write things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's certainly ... but now I guess my ... my reaction should be well great like\nGets it gets the attention [laughter] absolutely\nAll right let's go to the phones Brian in Indianapolis east of the Rockies say Brian\nHey George morning hey good to talk to you again hey hey\nAh first of all you had that you'll put up the show about a special report about working less in being at home and you know I got I got got co signed for student

third grade on her thank you Brian hey listen I\nMy wife and I are eight namely why a lot that pretty religiously and in operation a project Blue Book they had a special report I think it was like number fourteen or something like that to come out in the ... the\nThey they they sign they said they scientifically prove the UFO didn't eat this now you said earlier that the some of the believers in your new book or or movie\nOr were believers were were the people that they ran into the labor were people from project ... book and I take my answer off the air George you do a great job keep up you'd\nWork thanks Bryan will not talk to you too I'm trying to get time to do a live show in Indianapolis perhaps the next year if we can pull that off I think he was also talking about Nick the con didn't report\nYes um that that was um of course widely regarded now as a bit of a ... job and I think quite rightly the U.S air force made it quite clear that they wanted just to get out of the UFO\nOr at least they want it to the public out and and that's another point that we make in in the documentary aliens Pentagon really the winding up of project Blue Book um which was kind of just like the program went dark\nAnd of course this is the famous uh Poland a memo\nWhich which says the UFO reports which could affect national security are all made a in accordance with I think it's a chain up one for six and ... part of the blue book system\nSo so in other words the clue with there all along that that you ate he reports that had national security implications we're never going to be in the public program of Blue Book anyway\nNo that's a good point Nick since you've been doing this and you've been doing this for how long now how many years\nWell my goodness ah I guess I was

different locations around the world that that's about all coming from one place but there are centralized system of course so\nThe fact that this was a global outage suggests that there was some kind

I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair\nDebt collection practice laws federal um a truth and lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the\nGenesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cabal of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at\nEvery interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under than the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give it at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private\nYou lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you absolutely have to borrow go to a private bank get any private line of credit\nUh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan\nWhatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding et cetera can keep up with their budgets um you know I was\nJust in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee ... per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course\nFor a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nAgain the colleges are sitting in the ... seat they can't because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo polish much dead on the backs of students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really string the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nIt's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just floating and that's why we're seeing these just insane storied where people are graduating with\nYou know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're losing a guy walked out of school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental uh the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and just really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um after charge huge amounts just to pay out that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off that's Ninety million dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses scaling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with ... college when we come back if you've got a student loan give us a call if

turkey the president told vox business\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to close to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loan scam what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three ... and um\nI graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time uh and I tried everything I could keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera uh but what I fell into and what a\nProbably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into a is a lineage system that actually want you to fall so they will lose your paperwork\nThey will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboo and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me in my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government we used to be interviewed I might add a and so it was sort of snowball from there a right of course\nAnd I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared more for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy or these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll financed them\nWith just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... this is not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you bite on line and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should or read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know [laughter] uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\n... yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shots and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about\nI mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people who you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the ... system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq greasy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nAnd there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within\nSay a couple three or four years I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and\nYou know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollar she's crazy so this has just\nGotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition\nBy working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well you know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a\nGood thank you [noise]\nThey got good news for a man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big fines they throw at least according to see all day\nAnd he looked right at the whole ... oh [laughter]\nI Love it but uh anyway I I I wanted to gripe a little bit of trades will do a ... a former company I used to work or I got trained on egg wildly\nAnd when a company went under the under the company I'm a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but uh we pretty much went on during the late everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people do so I didn't know her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there with all due oh and I think well over ... years and\nYou probably in more than ... you had more experience than most people\nYeah and I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars that go it for oh I think it was a two month course\nJust on well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going unless ... ... dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive\nAnd then I felt like I got ... on that I found out that I could have gone up about half the price that even\nA let's get your reaction to this zone where do you think of trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jak through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke tax and other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly thank gallon he the one pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages credit card lending um and of course a tuition and inflation I our already knew that the more you set for dies the lungs especially the taxpayer on the hook on an aircraft a dollar by the way because

I'm Sorry all\nThis year I Would just be careful maybe ... or something dogs are pretty smart\nDog reads a mom and dad are golden retrievers then they're excellent guard dog they found like Savage that they're just in general they conveyed by it I said my sanity you know and especially talking about isn't alone and thank you for asking George sure\nAnd my question is I just got this thing in the mail today friend didn't even have on the time ... label where it was fine and it said in the big ladders final noted\nNever heard from the company but its current unified document services and saying you didn't have around consolidation ... read the action program\nAnd I'm kinda can turn on right now I'm On a ... fan base repayment program and I have no idea what they did that that was going to ask if you heard of it is comedy or and\nAgain to me Allen doesn't it do you have student loans out there gene\nI Do I Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't the scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this year's company but there are a million of them and this sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone a and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHi George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of a growing pose a failed hill\nHuh that job thank you and I'm hoping to hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the costs that I've ever heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I tried to negotiate directly with the video he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a few\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy rates back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third and third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the get alone he'll fall through the you know that's something you you can do but certainly dealing with a very close to me like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information Ellen like you said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying so\nI definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nBut my friend that had alone with the company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are some beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead [laughter] and\nWhen you release down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations you can follow you literally to the grid\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shine\nProblem [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens and the Pentagon

contacted the desert we were there ...\nAnd now with that before off to your life event in the city which we did\nThat was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you\nGreat job indeed aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's essentially a ... minute documentary that I put out to tell the story all off and leave and taking your credit gram but to take your life that story and and really to\nTry in one document tree Patel as fast as I can tell that story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with this phenomenon watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are absolutely be staggering the town that has been the biggest thing go wherever they are the UFO community I think that the only story that I think come\nLife and I would say this wouldn't if the tea classification release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off two decades to know the U.S government did have a new effort program after all when it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm an Asian feel that the other day and and you're like hey for years they said no no since project people close down we haven't been doing this with no in traffic or no investigation\nAnd of course they were and that's what I really focused on in in the new film aliens the Pentagon to try to train on angle the numerous threat\nTo the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of mistreatment both they're all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this Robert Bigelow Senator Harry Reid charmed along and you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff ... because it's coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with the story in one for you people have said the\nProblem is that particularly with the album we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the eight story with with\nThe revelation [noise] ah we almost have too much information and I think the public I mean it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just a confusing mess if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen their their landmark story on this on\nThe sixteenth floor chair and then the the three\nYears came out to first than a than a third one but now the public has been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this rock stone guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman\nAnd and they're struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back and and give people an overview of this from my end Slater perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film we didn't want in the course tonight Pentagon specifically about\nWell I took a logs on on on the one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seeds and and you've done this of course civilian times yourself you know you just sit in the ... said a direct tech kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and onto the questions and when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I\nGo edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put it in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so I scripted the entire movie I ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing\nAnd and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike alone I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this is somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure for me it's a completely\nNew role to me I I there are people of course who are used\nTo this sort of thing uh people like Jeremy coal bellicose just made a a a great movie but um you know only I was a departure for may so took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish\n[noise] firstly I as I say really to try to\nGo through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that\nThat this field has is\nIt we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go on to all the platforms that the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but to young people and and another thing\nIs you know it's been a year since termed along ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nRan a story I I did ... or you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon when to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you said the organization I'm E. E. T.\nRight yes I Am well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of that\nThe U.S government has said they'd always says in the ... situations only as little as possible and we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle\nFrom the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has\nHas a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going now are the people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nIn the book if ... if I think it is where it refers to say as being the print some power of the air and match I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople dead the idea that UFOs might beat them on it\nAnd there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\nYes and and it it it's frustrating in a sense because and and it's almost ... combing Klee ironic in another way that that you know you have a bunch of people\nIn in the cod that the IRA swear and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense had a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in the proper scientific manner and we come up against skepticism you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect um\nBut that skepticism isn't the sort of\nNicole or intellectual or humanists skepticism that I think most people I associate with that concept it's actually it's a\nDeep probably trying to build the trip and skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the Pentagon um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things that the money well it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another so we'll at least by these people were skeptical told\nThey will believe this but they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on coast to coast or you\nKnow you can get you updates ... would you do in the ... they just go to the book Doug ...
