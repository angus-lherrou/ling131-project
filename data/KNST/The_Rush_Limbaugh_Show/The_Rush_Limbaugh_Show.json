[{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "[noise] I'm going to get to that CNN [noise]\nCNN playing an impartial sound bite me to make it look like I was trying to make the case of can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I sending in fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah a lot of people\nWorked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it\nOr in due course same thing on this transgender business Trump diminished ration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nAh there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and it's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but under our constitution that Governor\nCan call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because of ... that normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do our Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border\nAnd make sure nobody forces there way no\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou didn't you you you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside life uh seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized border that if they bomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a a house and the Senate back in the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bringing back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and he started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people who planned this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own he needs to put everybody else or but on the line get 'em on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we

the other to get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the\nMedia they've had Republicans who are elected properly intended David they've been able to persuade

after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you keep falling for the lives and you keep falling for the hate yeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at\nThe CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer is afternoon show at some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now [laughter] it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pet it anymore but what is troubling as the ... behind him\nAnd see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as far as to who believes [noise] and he does it I think because it's still works instill rile people up\nThat divides us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump and see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes is\nHe does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows when he's ... knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spending like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake in the Washington establishment never Trump hers hey resent the hell out of Trump Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid\nNow you are which takes me to one piece\nThat I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurking ... brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale\nHis specialty is computer science but we have cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the Limbong letter way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L\nL C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd let me give you some pull quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating in for a reason most commentators forget to mention\nThe Democrats have no issues the economy is booming\nAmerica's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased\nPrint says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared in contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any honest leftist\nFor future generations the Kavanaugh fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to these charades and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan the whole Kavanaugh episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of tearing not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs this or a larger says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the let's only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America\nAnd hate America it does smokes\n\nNothing every leftist hates America but the leftist either no right to alert or at Yale\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional they hate his mistrust of intellectuals\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work\nThey have his refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all he doesn't have any ... except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him\nNot be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself\nIn vans and uses I'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity they but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate\nHe is certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I Believe\nI've had so many people are just not right and everybody has their you you do some way to do nobody can be that\nKind of an open I Am I Know your full of it fine no you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you'd be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that they love the quid vacation they love people see the both sides if things they he reaching\nOut with the heart they hate certain the especially when it conflicts with their own\nNow back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities guy went swimming\nDoesn't see the need to apologize for it sometimes he's treated women disgraceful you for which Americans left in Ryder ashamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but\nGo workers as my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the course most of ... constrained the average American Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents\nWorry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it\nThe difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump and those who can live with him\nThey love are merely tolerate him comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer the factory hand the author\nFact that this election was they're stolen from them and now it's time to make it All right and they are convinced that you want Trump investigated to aunt there just to be tied to heaven persuade you to join\nThe so now you're part of the problem and so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation that consists of a majority of angry deranged\nLunatics in order to get what\nThey the media and the Democrats want that's what they're trying to create right in front of our eyes\nLooking for an event and smack dab in the middle of London it was\nTerrible and\nAwful [laughter]\nWhat is going to be arrested two\nOr three and seven Ninety three sons most humiliating\nTalk three years ago making a murderer became less the TV show than a force of\nNature

mall but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the order of John ... making his eyes water so they use a mob\nThey don't want to see mark they use what whenever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people when it's good for them but when it's not when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster but there's\nYou know thousands of people on the line went on he couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go back\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR is a great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to that for that day listening to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can that\nYou've got four we've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh about\nThe only time I read it and NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said\nOh for the audience and that happens when I get the soundbites on that\nMaybe once every two or three weeks a ... of course NPR's not going to call it a mob\nNPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and a ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day citing believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings and they just have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an assault me screwed Trump Trump simpler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood\nThe American southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\n\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm\nA they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\n... Ramos or whatever it is it what does he tell among do ... what what what does it tell us tell them no but what is it Univision right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\n[laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run into you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past them\nLooking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd managing for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and then there are different people and all they want us a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people and let them in the all they want is what we want we all have these\nVarious humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't work and this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nHe doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nBut to sit there and to try to vouch for eight thousand people and to tell his audience who they all are and why we owe them and why we need to open our borders to them\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead and TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats book asked if the timing worry them and national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] white\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're

offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on immigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony and the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatened to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which he has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration\nWell [noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are every day anyway whether people show up in groups or two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this\nIt may make no sense of ... because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media\nThe Democratic party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned with hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta\nPut yourselves in their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times how Trump's toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has made goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power saying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\n\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\n\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see

real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building and we'd be we'd be seeing the top up here and Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting\nThere is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it he forecast that Democrats might win the house\nThat they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one the seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five and a half to two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house so all of this synthesized and stripped away and I went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple to Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise] and Trump is the great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another\nRetired historian and political analyst sends an email\nThat I received a lawsuit but I've been able to have the justice morning\nAnd I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them but I just want to share with your some of the things I get some of the is by the way legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me\nA into promoting whatever it is that since I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you\nThis passionately this guy who is it a story and who has studied the American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone just not as well known as he looks at things he usually is an absolute red wave\nAnd he did not believe this until last night he's been seeing trends in the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to convert into these trends are the actual prediction until now he says the numbers he's looking at from Nevada are exceptional in Minnesota Keith Ellison is\nThat's just the way we like it came on and have a conversation continues twenty four seven\nOf is just so much to say and not enough time to\nKNX DAM seven songs\nYears ago making a murderer became less the TV show of\nForce of nature and did uncover to rave injustice and the criminal justice it was also completely dance on it and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this David Avery and Brendan Bessie trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to re budding them\nMoney murderer is now on the ... I heard radiolab just open the\n[noise]\n\n\n\nUses mayor would find your direction one location designed to get\nPeople still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just\nSettling but when you think about it was\nReally not settling is graduating college with\nRushing didn't loan payment but do you have your green from nova feed you a ton of college and I\nDon't think you're settling with no education\n[noise]\nYou're listening to Russia's weeks in reviews are quick question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a\nTwo thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nNo no I mean how how many are the are the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming midterm the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet this Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium tour third team locations stadium tour they're going to charge admission for people to come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about\nPolitics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in that [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state and Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phone in collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\n\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger the wife and I remember hearing is not seen it just it just to pass it it's just it's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll see we'll let\nTime on the phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia I been within that there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate that you very much\nRush you know it's a you're talking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting\nThese bombs in the mail you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is already George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information is not out there for the masses to obtain you know quite being there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers and certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it tell\nAlong along those lines if you want to look\nAt it that way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis was going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and our history there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around\nWhat does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative word Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember\nThey believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it\nThey start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nPalestine he I what more do you watch well\nNot good enough apparently this is why I Can't find a temple by the way\nIf you know at temple here in town please let me know that isn't isn't uh and and they don't have to agree with me they just need to shut up about it I won't say anything I don't say anything anyway I Want you to hear what this woman said when she just by John Berman about President Trump over there we go listen to this\nYou welcome the president is or in the wake of the [noise]\nAsking that personal question\nI'm asking you I Do not [noise] I Do not welcome the president or vice city oh it's nice why not\nBecause he's the purveyor of ... states have half a critical um\nPoured that come from him\nTell me nothing hypocritical um we have a we have very very strong leadership and the city we have a very strong mayor with very strong value of what I just very strongly tiny executive rich Fitzgerald way of people who stand\nBy as it believing value not just Jewish values of leaving values and those are not the values of this president and I do not welcome to Pittsburgh\nWe just played the sound bite of a mayor no no we don't have armed anybody no no no I'm sure they have armed guards at the city council meetings where he goes\nNo no no I'm against illegal guns no crap dude who isn't\nSo there you go this is what I have to deal with and it's so frustrating so frustrating is not welcome you imagine you went to the January shootings or somebody said Obama's not welcome to Tucson\n\nI disagree with Obama I thought it was great that he came to Tucson after the shooting\n\nBy the way you'd be called a racist if you said I don't welcome Obama in my city\nIt's just the way it is just the way it is will continue nine fifty one it's

Lewis radio you got to follow the money\nAnd there's a story that I have from a I think it's from USA Today and ended up on a a TV\nIn Minneapolis, Minnesota somewhere there their website or\nThere's gambling websites now that are saying they were up there they're favoring Republicans keeping the house\nAnd they don't bookies don't get into this to lose money okay they must know something has happened on election night Hillary was heavily favored at about four thirty local time and by about six thirty\nThey were tied ...

best friend ... at the hands of a white police officer now facing pressure from all sides of the community star\nBecause what it shows is that whenever there is any kind of violence\nAny kind of uprising any kind of the first instinct of the drive by\nMedia has\nAnd I when I drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I wore dealt with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nJust said that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of death if Obamacare was not passed into law\nPeople remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence\nA bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to end up their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to impose it\nOn subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets that is why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words\nYou have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [noise] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable because they hate the president will do anything they can to get\nRid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger\nAnd if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person that\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives I mean he doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\nWell I've I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event even\nThough whether we can even get away from it from the weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domingo\n\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked in we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything and you know what if I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is by your man\nTo pay attention to it\nIs my man to come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about how many people do you think are fed up with this by now\nYou would think this is going to affect the midterm elections Democrats and maybe I got I got a clue for ya neither of these events that you are hyping are going to ... change significantly the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going you pretend to ratchet these two things\nUp and try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump you may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up into somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the mid term\nI can tell you right now I mean a ... do not know it from a ... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up with being blamed they're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed and so they just they just tune it out you think about all of the mass shootings have cops back during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support those you have the support black lives matter and they weren't condemned there weren't any consequences\nFor that protesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri and and literally tear up a town on why\nThey create a lie about the shooter in that in that ... the Mike Brown ... first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store in ... whatever it was they just totally making up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming Donald Trump now\nIt it it gets it gets to the point that if the media wonders why they're in such ill distribute right now it's because of this\nNobody believes what'd you say nobody\nTrusts one you're saying it's so obviously politically charged so obviously you're you're passionate about this\nIs what you're going to do with this politically\nThe guy that shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill section of ... I Know this place well I Lived there not squirrel hill but I Know where it is\n\nThe guy that shot this place up hated\nDonald Trump Donald Trump was too big a Jewish supporter his daughter converted to Judaism before marrying questioner he more into the\nAmerican embassy to Jerusalem this guy thinks Trump is part of the sellout\nTo worldwide and Jewish people and yet the media is blaming Trump\nThey're saying well a lot of that that is a rock and all that just that that that's just a disguise you know that\nThat that they just did that the cover up Trump's real anti Semitism Donald Trump's maybe one of the best friends in Israel and Israeli Jews have had in the in the oval office and I don't know how long remember the case\nOf\nWas it was just a David Koch David Koch of the Koch brothers they're re Wichita energy from and family\nAnd David Koch and his wife Julia donated twenty five million dollars to some New York hospital the nurses association and other organizations at the hospital told the hospital's not doing except the donation\nBecause David Koch is nothing more than a yellow ballet and white privilege racist and the only reason for his donation wants to cover his racism and hide it so people didn't really see\nThis is who the left is so they even reject acts of charity as\nIll motivated why does somebody think that way what would make those nurses thinks that way I submit to you that it is the drive by media I submit to you that it is their union leaders and maybe instructors teachers they have in school\nWere not even legitimate acts of charity work compassion\nAre allowed because they're not real their relief from racist in big it's who are trying\nTo mask and cover up their racism and bigotry and so the money should not be accepted and if it were accepted it should be returned\nAmericans Republicans conservatives have been blamed for the deaths of ...\nSo the left wants Trump to tone down his efforts at self defense that's what Trump is doing he's assaulted he said countless times if I'm here I'm going to hit back\nWhen Trump is blamed for the actions of a lunatic he's told to be more dignified remain silent be like Mitt Romney would

the way this works is [noise]\nUh thirty six year old allegation can be bad for which there is no evidence Adam for which force opposing witnesses candy but the place themselves at the place because the victim doesn't know where it happened doesn't know when it happened but it becomes real and we got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kavanaugh exposed to sit\nBack and just take he's just she those are the old rules in Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to not make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not that Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it and you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh\nDon't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy being elected and he's supposed to just sit there and take\nYou wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was smeared and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\n\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works\nIn Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined\nAnd he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down toward\nWell the thing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have the Mayor Bill Clinton was very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need is more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control was not the answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about\nGuns it's about something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in East Africa but but but but but what we're all for freedom if we define it he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with a Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews it used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close\nBy another branch close by to unify them all the court and joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at Fort Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter said Mr President do you think you need to revisit seem so a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\nBy the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise and all that tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not\nReally focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway the reporters as Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws this\nPart is that the rightful owners of those names never had a clue who he was they never had a clue they were being ripped off until retailer started calling them\nViolent crime it's why people have life like have light flock to protect them from every kind of identity theft see when you have a life luck\nYou'll know immediately when somebody is running

got some experience for the Hollywood types in Europe parents that opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to it when it comes to Israel\n\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they they they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't couldn't he said that they were I mean because one thing to\nSay that yes because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think it's a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're really they're willing to claim the victim had nothing else [noise] [laughter]\nWell the one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal Jew is like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThe ... it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there is there's so much anti Israeli sentiment\nAmong Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's anti the religion and it's not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's if the religion in time the river legion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from religion I don't think you can and that you know any any time you're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes up now with a disclaimer I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel doing that yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics disassociated with with Israel is a book because if their entire religion that's big\nI mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see this or anti Christian too um I don't see them as necessarily\nBeing seeing Islam but I you know but I think it's the it's a it's a ... I thought\nThat's exactly right I was wearing Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious

else that you say that you are\nThe gold the liberalism creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis has been in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah it doesn't and I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there targeting\nA Jews and the way that they would want to go she got the thing that I think that that these are isolated incidents in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe as a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish\nI and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything silly like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people think and there are a predominant ... thank you thank you so much a re July precepts racial from Thousand Oaks California [noise] um\n\nI don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you you think I'm wrong or you\n\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipelines none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded to the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK\nWell there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat and then the second event happens on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political ...\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an\nEntirely different it's why I did the show opened today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact I think the media\nTheir natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since Sunday shows yesterday with is the attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThis is Trump spoiled and\nThe media wants to be exempted from any impact ... they they damn well one of the things they influence opinion and shape the outcome of elections\nBut they don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what people do the same time it seems in Congress to me here when they when they get called out on this they deny it this is a montage Tom boss search\nWho a former national security adviser and Stephanopoulos and Mary Jordan of the Washington Post\nI Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American viewers are looking at in terms of murder\nAnd he also has a lot of the reason why the murder\nYou know here's what I said ... yeah he is responsible for fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls them out\nOh yeah I don't think Trump responsible for a ... looking and it was a murder we didn't say there's no well we didn't see that Matthew Dowd but he is responsible for his own for the rhetoric that led to do murder\n[laughter]\nNo they all so that they when when they're when they're confronted with what they're actually saying that they pulled back and deny it\nBecause we're coming right back\nI Am shuttle Stevens I'm here to talk about

[noise] you know I don't know what happened\nTo Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist a reporter for the wall Street Journal is the the international\nPolitical expert at what have you and I used to\nThink of the guy as a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me his pieces\nIn advance thinking I Would enjoy them\nBut ever since Trump was elected he has gone off the reservation I mean to the point that a lot of what what will people asking what what what happened to Max Boot\n[noise] and now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on that just ripping Trump a new one primarily from the standpoint that Trump's manners and his behavior and his ah\nCompartment just isn't present control and you know the usual complaint from the\nEstablishment grad so he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media do conservatives are being brainwashed and an echo chamber form rumor and conspiracy theory\n\nThis tweet is then replied to by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other van and Wilbur ultra left his\nHeart was says Max Boot is one hundred percent correct most important extremism on the right has gotten baked into the entire movement and the G O P White House Congress Fox Limbaugh Breitbart the pack\n[noise]\nI maintain to you as I said in my opening monologue the program today\n\nThat we get up every day and we see people and institutions that we

murderers by the Democratic party am willing accomplices in the media Mr boats simply because we don't believe in the man made climate change folks\n[noise]\nMurderers Republicans have been called murderers for not supporting Obama's takeover of the American health care\nIndustry for the purposes of putting it under the auspices of government for the purposes of controlling the way people live\nA\nPartisanship on both sides but know left wing outlets propagate extremism is successful lawyer why\nThe mainstream media is extremism if you ask me that's what they've become daily media\nReporting has become extremism it certainly isn't factual\nIt certainly\nHas an investment in the outcome of events and somehow we conservatives\nIn the media are far more successful\nIn propagating extremism and are you in this audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber\nBy rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I'm also mentioned in the first hour that Trump was elected\nTo behave differently [noise] he was elected precisely\nBecause he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's kinda understand a little one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and\nTalks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people were murderers and rapists and you just don't talk about them that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about him that way but\nTrump did and so they all start laughing I think this guy can't be serious he is not going to last his campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump bleeding\nThis guy is not going to laugh and it's just quite amazing that Trump tapped slowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary on all of them had this preferable a laid back a walk all over me attitude toward the left and Democrats that you want\nTrump kept eliminating them one by one by one with catchy nicknames and so forth\nAnd they fought this to sift it can't happen these camps that you're never going to survive in the Access Hollywood video convey thought that was it was over and nobody can survive but\nTrump survived and then they started the two years silent cool and that is the real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left I'm going to tell you something Mr boat there is nothing that I\nOr anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and he is doing\nIn corrupting\nThe highest levels of our government the express purpose of overturning an election I don't care how much power you think I've got I couldn't come close\nTo doing what was done and has been done the past two years including the Mueller investigation including the planning of out right lies\nFive times a day in media all over the country from anonymous people alleging that it was only a matter of time before proof that Trump pen colluded with Russia to steal the election for\nTwo years Mr boot for two years with\nNo evidence and everybody in on it knew there was no evidence everybody in on this new that there had not been any collusion they were hoping\n\nThey were hoping and they live with every day with the ideas are going to wake up and that the

range they are over their failure to get rid of all\nI Know they're psychology\nI Know these people in the media and I know that these Democrats they are just\n... themselves that\nBriefings they've got in their arsenal of weapons hasn't worked\nSo given that this is the sum total of\nIntelligence guided by experience I don't believe\nI'm not gonna believe just because I'm told that something happened the way it did\nAnd that's a shame it's a shame that the highest levels of our government have gotten to the point where this trusting them is a common sense pickle things to do but they've

Republicans bother it's independence never Trump voters on the conservative side the whole of the Washington establishment so\nHere we are two weeks before the midterm elections the Democrats [noise]\nWe have to win it\nThey've told everybody to the American people are tired at Trump and they want to get rid of him they realize their mistakes even telling everybody there's going to be a

more than ... trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is\nDestroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has\nTo be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something air mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and\nAnd and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never\nI had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to us and people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that said it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists are these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty\nMinutes it was all about that and it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin all it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it I I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how raising early on is this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected\nBy life to\nHim everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions\nI'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions and he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this Lees editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from\nWay back before the series began and the editor ranges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it\nAnd the private ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kinds of personalities you would have to be if your job is\nDestroying people no conscience the belief that everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this is the eyes of a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine real journalist I got to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's it exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women the competing\nEditor of the clean paper the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the pita files story while\nThe other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it because the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not whether recalls that got as a beat up I'll just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts\nStill run it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously are not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing\nTogether so the name of it is ...

O. J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales of justice arm line the department of justice does nothing including indictments that would impact and election now\nThe Hillary cases that I had to exonerate heard their futures dependent on it their careers dependent on it and she was a Democrat nominee they're not going to be in the business\nOf charging and pursuing and diving the Democratic nominee again are seizing the unwritten regulation not impacting the elections so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in smaller is report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know I but of what could happen\nSince they've decided to leave that Mueller is about finished since they've decided to delete that the report is eminent let me get that headline again just to not have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise]\nNow you know this was going to drive the left literally batty\n... they're not going to be able to restrain themselves\nHow long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is how long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon\nOr little Brian style turned Jake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we know it shouldn't affect the outcome of the elections will be told\nI\nThink the odds of that are pretty good or not well let's play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up to the mall or it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on Mahler to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it and there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks didn't want to read the sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the guns yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf Mueller doesn't have any of that there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nSo nobody said this stupid\nBut it's bad for our country but they're going to vote Democrat no matter what we do they will be voting Democrat and they understand that that's why Democrats support programs like catch and

be able to actually hold on to the house after Raul unlikely but not impossible [noise]\nThey say that they've heard from Democrats as well as Republicans saying that well the winds have shifted

almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would\nBe covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave and of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet nobody wants to rely on polling data to suggest is going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's\nHappening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop\nNow the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the board and how Trump didn't like the narrative and didn't want it but last so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans\nElected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them if they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic\nGambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that would do to Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters begin to\nI don't doubt is the right where they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get him\nIf if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many\nTwo thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\n\nSeven thousand people one day just decided\nTo start walking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden it aside all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people to sign to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people chewing things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams that what would the environmentalist wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could order\nCustoms with especially the ... in the street and they get maps in San Francisco for tourists can wipe the piles of human PC\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you just stop or slow down and rest for the next\nDay that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those are real Linda that's over three months\n\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months\nHave we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise] and then of course a ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been\nJoined by a second the caravan that we are just hearing about Fox News ... ... S P report that a second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras\nAnd has already crossed into Guatemala they're hoping to catch up to the main group\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims\nAnd basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from and also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not made and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the I talked to Louis he'll talk about Jeffrey is talk of the Jeff and I won't even know who is part of who you're talking about Jeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions or big buddies that means he's talked ... about this but these are all great points\nThey already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after a gaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises it's adventure waiting but I think this was the left behind it\nFor a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold [noise]\nHave found me ... dot com slash real\nNineteen eighty one the doctors have ... in Arizona here it was pretty big issues with theory on this family own practice specializes in comprehensive evaluations\nWith personalized scare they understand the importance of your hearing what it means for you and your loved ones you trust your hearing held to Arizona hearing specialist voted Arizona Daily Star readers choice winter twenty eight requires an appointment Arizona here\n\n[noise]\nAnd now the heart radio we can sport time capsule\nFellow sports fans is any west that I'm here to take you on a journey back\nTo this week in sports history are back in Nineteen sixty four for the famous wrong wave run the Vikings Jim Marshall picks up a fumble and runs sixty six yards\nIn the wrong direction for safety still to this day it is the NFL's number one blue for this week in Nineteen Seventy the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers plead their first home game losing to the San Diego rockets one ten Ninety nine\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy one Texas Stadium opened the Dallas Cowboys beat the New England patriots forty four to Twenty one stadiums unique root structure covers all of a cease unless the playing field exposed to the elements it was often says it's a whole on the roof was designed to allows got to watch his team play\nLike God's the cowboys fan this week in Nineteen Ninety event or Holyfield knocked out James ... list for the heavyweight boxing title if we can Nineteen Ninety three the NFL announced the new ... the Carolina Panthers\nWill be in Charlotte and they will begin playing in Nineteen Ninety five and this week in the year two thousand the Monday Night miracle occurred down thirty seven at the end of the third quarter the New York\nJets pull together and improbable comeback with for touchdowns in a field goal in the fourth quarter eventually defeating the Miami Dolphins forty thirty seven overtime at your heart radio weekends for a time\nCapsule and how he might use aboard over interfering with his job interview somebody ... dot com [noise]\n\nEm robot great to have your Rush Limbaugh kicking off a brand new week a broadcast excellence here an eight hundred to eight two to eight\nEight to ... [noise] one\nMore with Louie Gohmert he is from Texas she's on with the bill hammer and Sandra's with this morning bill cameras says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members\nOf the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizes the care of it by the way the the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian state pump pale raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into Michael claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was your raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how is it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when we have a\nParty a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this\nWho when their right mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this it wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what\nEver motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake which takes\n\nHave somebody finally pushing back on this because remember of the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and form you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night pump pale who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging at a state\nBut that many of the migrants were criminals themselves by definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world is so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of house off this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest for being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened in our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people\nRight and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a may I ask a bunch of experiences\n\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with the people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket\nBut the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning anything\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there has been this slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking them for a generic polls\nOr be to use on dude I was hoping they should go to the radio dot com parking is free scare Lewis believe it or not fully is writer\n\nAnd as the on my heart radio enjoyed the stimulation [noise]\nI'm going to get to that CNN [noise]\nCNN playing an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case of a shell game\nDeserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nOr is this pump pales saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop and invasion\nAnd I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ... that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what Woodrow Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and you know\nIt's a no brainer folks it is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou did you you you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gilbert says there but there's no law says he can't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter]\nWhat if we could make that case what do you think that people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics I don't care if you're militarized is the border if they bomb rush the border like ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back in the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nDo you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad\nFor Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people who planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own needs to what everybody else or but on the line good I'm On bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it isn't a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nLike to get off\nTo Russia and by be Mitt\nWork pretty smart Russia is on CNN [noise]\nVoters have a choice on election day liberals want open

I saw one recently flying over Californian north to south\nAnd you were eagles flying straight down the coast of North Carolina of California into the ...\nAnd then in the Mexico and it it's fun just to figure out\nI edit the night views you can see Ireland and the u._k. you can see a North Korea is just dark as it can be but because it's not a standard map view it's fun to figure out what's what\nAs the and the space station is what two hundred miles high if these are fascinating for cable news I often a crack at a map\n\nWe're talking here about Costa Rica I'm Doris Guatemala El Salvador Panama now according to the map that I cracked Costa Rica in Panama are much closer to Honduras than the u._s. is\nCosta Rica's only four hundred miles from Honduras Panama is five hundred

immigration officials\n\nIt's a microcosm of what's happening every day in this country this invasion of people end up becoming illegal immigrants\nThere's a lot of money behind this water Marla remember this Trump said that in Guatemala and Honduras El Salvador did not\nDo their part in stopping this that we were going to severely cut off or reduce\nMassive foreign aid that we give them Trump has tweeted while the model of Honduras El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country in the coming illegal to be us we will now began cutting off or substantially reducing\nThe massive foreign aid routinely given to them\n\nWhen they grab a phone call quickly this is Steven Gorman, California\nAnd that that that that uh [noise] after this I Want to go up\nThe line to Steve great great to have you how you doing sir\nDoing good how are you sir\nFine and dandy great to have you on the program today\nHey great but I talk to your call screener and what I see is public Democrat Partridge injury because they had a problem and twenty sixteen months panic came out and vote for Trump looked at one of them too I've seen some stores they aren't going to do at the time because the pocketbook issues and making good money taxes are lower jobs so if you're part\nOf a whole thousands and thousands of people on that border and start running storage we're talking about where the suffering there's no food is this and that is that you're looking at people who are the Ken banger country man maybe the extent of nieces and nephews\nAnd while you go to the polls that week beforehand and looked at both stores warned about the oil that level I think if there are dealt them with their strong sense of family I daddy into going back to the party even though they know in their own interest they should vote Republican\nOkay All right so let's let's let's walk through this\nIf I understood correctly you would think that this is a Democratic Party

Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated Ron dissenters last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the what an Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist it really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as a collective go that's communist ... she was talking about Florida\nAs law or a collective he hid it would be a disaster for Florida right now to elect anybody like this guy\nBecause of what he will do\nIn racking a growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing like gangbusters ... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down this is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist\nWho doesn't want there to be in the private sector success because the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate\nI and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually

chamber for whatever leftist leadership and the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not but\nThe Santas would be great defense as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there is nothing\nIf it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while the trend is constantly upward people have have are\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has\nBeen made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you get a better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWe we stole a lot of what we have we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution\nThen you'll elect these Democrats I Can't I Can't imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved with ... in any way want to put the brakes on this and for what reason because they don't like Trump\nTweeting because it'll like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\n\nTrump to support it because he's in the last line\nTo hold off on this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by like this this mob seven thousand\nPeople demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you've got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful America needs to be punished\nWhatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democratic party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can they don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content\nOn your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful or anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited\nExtremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly with psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders\nAnd normalize them and that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed anyway\nI mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personified eyes personify the exact total wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put put one of these up\nOn the little cam if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up\nThat is one view of a ...

government they said members of the migrant\nCaribbean wanting to enter Mexico would have to request a visa through their consulate and bold immigration law they don't do that there'll be turned back wow oh about that maybe this is part of the year we got a trade deal with Mexico\nAll of a sudden all of a sudden uh Mexico wants to work with us this new president you know he's a socialist whatever they elected it it it is what it is a again I Can't see the snuff though a freaking wall would work well wouldn't it would work very well\nNow the guy that organized this whole situation is a a former Honduran a lawmaker\nAndy with three thousand people left Honduras cross the border illegally to Guatemala when Trump threatened to withdraw the money that we're going to cut off your funding all of a sudden Guatemalan officials sent their law enforcement out and they arrested this guy\nThey woke yeah [laughter] they arrested him and they said you got to stop doing this they said he didn't comply with Guatemalan immigration rules and he was deported back to Honduras is that racist\nWhy when we get called that for for doing that I mean come on and up as enough you exactly thank you very much but\nThe only thing you gotta worry about is China China is trying to get in there\nOr the Honduran president said last month's cuts in us support for Central America would only under the country's ability to stimulate the immigration basically we're bribing you give us your money you welcome China's growing diplomatic presence in the region as an opportunity that's one thing we need to watch more of them are rush continues every day\nFrom the region will studio your local area reason well darn calm day in the yard radio station [noise]\nHe hopes they didn't know I mean ... is President Trump suggesting Saudi Arabia's leaders shouldn't be guilty until proven innocent\nAnd the suspected murder of a journalist so we insists he's not giving cover to the king and the crown prince other although I just want to find out what's happening with turkey reportedly has recorded evidence we've asked for it if it exists expects a full report from the secretary of state she was on his way back to Washington\nBut they didn't care because Obama was hip they didn't care because Obama was cool they didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except the one Obama was enabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats as we discussed in great detail yesterday\nAnd ... came to me today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch\nStory I said you mean about ... said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or story\nOr having evidence of how your shoulders died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you wouldn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central ... elements\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to constantly and then I have to consider he has a point\nBut there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just know it's impossible there is no way that Jamal ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession of his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially since apple has yet to activate L T\nE service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so unless ... had entered the password for the consulate wife my network on his watch which I Know he didn't do\nBecause most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there watch will work on why\nMost people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a y find enough work like at your home that your phone logs into regularly on the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not\nClose together but\nOnly if you have entered that why ... works password into your\nI watch why five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise]\nI myself didn't learn you had to do this until a couple of years after I got my first one I mean that's how old's your a setting that it is anyway certainly says you just blew\nUp you blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nI said well I was totally unaware he said well you should be aware because they're mad after [noise]\nNobody's most that they they say the show was recorded the event and have to record on watching their base will say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not\nPossible another headline you probably have seen this so she added pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating\nBlue wave including none other than they do I am\nA Democrat National Committee cheating and election rigging\nDown to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I should shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise]\nThat's right so see and I got her so Fox willingly open our mid to late ... had done in Brazil on an hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time in ...\nBill and I don't scramble my eggs before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather I don't scramble my eggs until my chickens hatch\nShe said meaning there's so much she left it couldn't happen that we don't know that could affect the outcome here exactly my point the impact of\nThe election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although\nThere is even more survey data now that the Kavanaugh story was a one way benefit to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats and the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd that the Kavanaugh scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republican\nSo the media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren focused on this thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunning shocked where is Bert rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what ... knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\nYou think Obama's going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here started campaigning as if this blue wave weren't a\nDeadlock if the blue waiver at why are you still hear me [noise]\nOh yeah I got a ... couple of stories Democrats are upset whereas Obama they're asking where's Iraq at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find mama I'm telling you Obama is not going to GO Campaign and the situation because of the blue wave is not a walk and that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mama doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have a coat tails\nIt's during Obama the Democrats lost those twelve hundred seats and in right he campaigned for Hillary\nTwo thousand sixteen remember how he did it\nDo you want a third term of mud brick if you want me since we continue you know do you vote for Hillary at what happened\nDid and all this Trump was it match it late at night Hillary Rodham running them and so\nHe's not there\nSo it's all falling apart and these two or three stories here on this on this dissipating blue wave and Donald Brazil's Enron now I'm not sure you know it's a long time twenty days\nSo the AP pulling out all the stops Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame a GOP loses this is not what he said and this is why\nTrump is in the media all day it's the only way he can counter the fake news in the lives that they\nTell about it here's how the story begins facing the prospect of bruising electoral defeat in congressional elections\nPresident Donald horse faced Trump said Tuesday that he will not accept the blame if his party loses control of the house in November and a wide ranging and is there any other kind of interview than wide ranging\nYou think that's not a cut and paste job in every media is how about a narrow scope interview we ever had one of those you\nKnow they're always in a wide ranging interview with three weeks before election day Trump dismiss suggestions that he might take responsibility as his predecessor did for midterm losses\nOr view of the outcome as a referendum on his presidency said no I think I'm helping people\nI don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of impact that's what he said he never stand it don't blame me\n\nAnd I read the transcript of the interview this is CNN's transcript of the AP interview and their headline\nTrump tells a piece he won't accept blame a GOP loses house ready [noise] three two one hey\nPete reporter okay so my question is if Republicans were to lose control of the house in November sixth or a couple of days later depending on how long it takes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that no I think I'm helping people\nLook I'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those for the aid is you know where people that had no chance in some cases we look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia governor\nMany many racist and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that I'm having they would say that in the old days and if you got the support of a president or if you got the supporters somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like

com [noise]\nMichael Jackson as a buffer rotation\nBlood on the dance floor with some proper fall of obviously the league [noise]\nRates have you ever hear of telephone number eight hundred to a two to eight eight to look at this\nIs headlines I'm doomed bird knows Mahler ready to deliver key findings\nIn his Trump pro ... sources say\nDo they think that we are idiots\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces in and sit by and pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything it has got to be in tents\nEverything has blown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on I'm Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blew up on them every attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now\nYou know they've thought all along the mother is going to get the goods on how Trump's Foley electrician by cheating including what the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Muller is not going to deliver a key findings until after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with all the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but\nThey're they're lured attack\nThe reins\nPsychologically screwed up\nBase\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they have been they bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump treated with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this books\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural India and say it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise to me it's a it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing or if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like\nWhich the latter is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies in the drive by media\nRather than break the rules and released a report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing\nThey're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump pro\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that mom Liz Dunn rollers wrapped up his mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking about before\nThe midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is imminent that\nIs what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they\nWill create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger\nThat port handles disaster for Trump they'll referenced this each day leading up to the mid term elections\n\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms\nWouldn't blow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein who is technically is boss at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not that it is made public\nIt was early warning systems or emergency services warning so we know we saw it immediately it was down and the only thing we can think of was that I blow it out with the energy level here of the content of the program ... booted it were up and running now\nSo the downtime was minimal\nSorry for that if it affected you here's Tom in Morris county New Jersey we had to the phones readings are great to have you here\nThanks rash thanks for doing everything that you do Russian I had two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter out there\nFor for my when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign one of the reasons that I see\nA during the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um I became a\nTrump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans put it in a way\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you what frustration is so high right now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because you said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says he's the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his choice to good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand ...\nWait a minute when you say when you say package you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which treat tweak most of the time and the press conference they ... they skew anyway\nSo if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done\nThe greatest time economically that I can never remembered I'm sixty six\nI can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well and that shocked you write\n[noise] you know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen or we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's just one guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't rich or\nAudience that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people in the same boat who were doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't do it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea here newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that led realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListed do you read\nThem but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a wage is going up on my machine aging\nMy point is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all\nOf this and that more people are aware of it than you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have to say Russia's probably ... being met work\nPretty smart rushing is on [noise]\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life

series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is very serious take them to feel very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise]\nDon't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries\nEnd up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously\nHas to be something they're doing with breaking the rules in the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something air mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to us and people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that ... it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or a a a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\n\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved\nTo adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watched\nThis I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave similarly on is this is one of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected\nBy life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this just sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending

his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls

to\nDiscredit a whole bunch of like the tariffs and what it's doing to trade the problem is\nReality reality on the ground if the if if if the if the numbers are a ring to that extent it just isn't gonna jibe with reality\nAnd it's it's it wouldn't be I don't think nearly as effective as something as personal but I think you have to you have to look at the history of these October surprises they've tried October surprise in October they've tried them in September\nThey've thrown everything they've got at Trump including during the campaign the Access Hollywood video and that didn't work\nNow he's out they're calling the orange star who by the way is a back stabbing black mailing double crossing porn star he's out there combing her horse race and there are shutters\nThat drive by me the s U D D who my gun presidents doesn't is you know what I find interesting about this\nAll of these so called ... and virtue on the left we're wandering perversion has become normal in their

doubled crossing\nBack\nStabbing woman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer\nShe's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call one name\nShe is a woman who attempted to him but for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like\nPeople don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on\nPeople talk this way this is what ... what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores the wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply look at the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom your Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people I mean they're they're comedy has become literally hate\n\nAnd then they act like one of the greatest social trends question your history of humanity has occurred when Donald Trump uses the term horror\nSpace or when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ... feet in\nThe truth about her allegations I just I just find it to just a little bit hollow as low take your pick ticket that take your pick any left wing or on media\nGriping about Trump's using the word horse race and ask yourself if that media reporter\nNever talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity the presidency\nWell I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they\nCan try all day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters Mike Shanahan that\nThere's so much good going on here and focus on that don't don't need to distract every body with that stuff\nBut you do\nThere are also going to they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder\nOf the uh of the journalists is in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nA dramatic a shaggy they're still working on that\nBut I think they're frustrated to no end that nothing they do works\nAnd now I have a story I have to print I haven't had the chance to printed yep just cleared the transom here uh it's about Trump's approval numbers are probably much better and much higher than anybody on the left and the media wants to admit\nThe gold rush is on\nAnd as you miss work if you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you can

no I'm In St Paul it down with Joe leading to talk about his new album Egypt and then of course some discussion about a little band called the lead off and we were when we were playing music I her radios inside the studio by cat check it out now\nTalk I Gerald Lewis Jessica Vaughan Center for Immigration Studies thoughts about what is going to have to stop that migrate caravan from getting here what Trump can do as well interviews at my age ... dot com\nI'm Persian ski\nAnd she\nHas now gone back to the twenty Fifth Amendment we we need to use a twenty of a member to get rid of\nTrump he's not he's not that there's ... ... ... not\nThat she didn't know anything about the event she couldn't tell anybody where it happened when it happened she couldn't describe the house where it was she wasn't even sure of the year much less of the month she\nIdentified for people over there all four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump dead was remind everybody of this or actually inform them because the drive buys have not\nAnd that then cause the meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hid it because it was not helpful to their ... their claws which was getting rid of Cavanaugh\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places people there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer the media not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports\nOver and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo my career he would've had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonator he simply reminded everybody and real world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point\nIn the outcome of those hearings make no mistake\nOnce Trump did that and caused the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThan\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford man is jihad no evidence there was nothing to support\n\nPeople with common sense there was nothing to you you believe her yeah the basis of what well it does have one but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said there were there to say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point in Kavanaugh came in and of course he has his re testimony has re appearance was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again\n\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger\nForum on ... drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels and the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all of this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he'd paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how was he is\nBut the media\nInvested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around that Dr buyers were they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause ... even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart a judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump claiming it was bogus it had no merit so in one decision\nThe porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political and so did the lifespan of her creepy porn warrior who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to a news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact\nShe had been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here the the the prostitute porn star is paying\nTrump who among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\n\nThey also ignoring that part of it\nIgnoring that the stripper porn star and been ordered to pay Trump's legal fees but when Trump called her horse race in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story of his victory so you can sit there and say that Trump is embarrassing\nGuys they were just stopped talking about people that way it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original take or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that first take\nOn the record media says well if you were reasonable you said that Dr Balt the Ford was very credible very compelling shakedowns surprising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you've got no evidence and here's the evidence that she knows no evidence\nBlah blah by the Trump gets his news covered\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit a bit from the media was not reporting and she had to pay his legal fees the media was not reporting of being\nTrump win\nAnd remember what was this woman and her lawyer we're trying to ruin\nTrump campaign finance violations and all that so you can say you may not like the methodology but it ends up working as an email friend of mine said this is a genius\nAt work [noise] trust Trump\nYou me too but he thinks it calling or horse race was genius somebody [noise] you know an email that I have here let's see what the Democrats try this headline this is\nFrom the hill dot com Democrats damp down hopes for climate change agenda what what is this uh\nDemocrats are on the likely to pursue a major climate change legislation even if they win the house majority despite a growing body of evidence suggesting time is running out to address the\nIssue is represent a shift in strict the jury for when House Democrats last control the chamber in two thousand nine they they're not going to pursue it even if they win the house majority they are not going to pursue it's\nA wonder why\nCould it be that in the span of forty years we've now have the force ten year warning\n\nAt least the fourth warning that we only have ten years and in the midst of these forty years we've also had reports that we're beyond the point of no return that there really is nothing we can do\nThey've tried everything now they're even saying that climate change is going to destroy beer and there's nothing we can do you know why is\nClimate change going to ruin barley it's going to ruin the ability to harvest and grow barely barely won the primary ingredients and beer\nBad news for judge Kevin alright\nInvestors business daily Trump's approval rating is better than you think\nSome pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than are tied with three of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent\nIs above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here\nDemocrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls showed that his approval is starting to wind up with previous presidents and what's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother poll quote\nAt this point than Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed pork you it was it was\nAfter the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank another policies highly antagonistic\nTo Republicans Trump on the other hand gets her approval\nFrom only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been if Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive\nTrump with a GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does I have to think that the drive by are fully\nAware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is a much higher here's that story certainly you didn't believe it Daily Beast Democrats fear Obama going soft for the midterms\nI kind of ... when I look at vote turnout a in an election like this I I like to assume that's why I asked me why why to assume that the audience at this program\nIs fully aware and up just like you are I think your typical of people in this audience there are here because you're concerned you here because you're educated than warm and involved and invest in in an outcome\nI most of the people in this in this audience are exceptions obviously\nSo I I I worry that it's somehow talking down to people to\nNot remember you're talking about their vote you know you don't want the Democrats running out there are people already know that other words I'm looking for\nDifferent ways to accomplish the same motivation\nTime have found me thinking ... dot com slash real\nShow me someone who's pinching pennies and living in constant fear of running out of money and retirement\nAnd I'll show you someone who doesn't have a plan

listen to the interview on my fantasy dot com [noise]\nPleases jobs and I have a\nQuestion I continue to get emails about the [noise]\nThe so called Washington Post journalist or jump off you're showing\nMy question is are really rather simple one where was this concern for our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi\nSomebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid\nTo what\nHas it been confirmed if something happened since this program ... has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia hasn't been confirmed not confirmed so it's still Whiteclay or thought to end the story is that\nTook him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out and then they listen to music\nWhile they did all of this\nAnd of course until I blew up the theory and at the apple watch contain the evidence they ever going to try to make it look like\nProof existed in the form of audio recordings to show ... knew what was in store for him and he had an ego is apple watching the recording this stuff and uh somehow is iPhone that very very unlikely\nBecause of it being technologically impossible barring a ... just only two exceptions that I have a tough time believing she'll be even knew to do or how to do but\n\nAll of this concern and remember\nHillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in Ben gossipy\nWith no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustration is is anybody see\nA a disparity here in proportion\nNow of course we all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way of blaming Donald Trump for this CNN all afternoon has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable graphics that they were using to try to make that case\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here and again I don't think the media realizes how obvious\nThere's subterfuge is that people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had two ... two doors did you know that\n\nDr balls the foreign had two doors that something to do with a claustrophobia and fear\n\nAnd handed over to Google employees reading this\n\nWait a minute it was a five hundred square foot plates and two front door is it the\n\nOther Google employees going back and they have their own separate front door oh well that's that's a big difference than meeting at four claustrophobia and ... D like being afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years well anyway\nEverybody has a home with a front door and the lock on most people have one front door for some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door in every\nWindow is what's important to feel safe in the side now how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was his name was fairly expensive\nAnd then simply say palm security came along offering a solution to protect all of your doors and windows in the most effective ways for far less money\nThey get that done by using states will be our technology and the systems they make\nThey use wife ... folks to connect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the age the cameras the motion detectors the glass break sensors all of that they communicate with the primary base station in the house my wife I certainly wires to run that is so\nSo important so crucial in making this\nLast complex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to get I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting wife I connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use ... and they use computer chips in their centers in an detectors in the age the cameras that come with every system that sends signals when doors and windows are open\nAnd if you arm just simply save system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e somebody tried to break in or are there is a fire or something simply safe pays attention to every detail of their home security system so that when you do the installation it's\nSimple and actually fun to do when you finish\nYou will have an intimate knowledge and awareness of your system it comes pre tested in pre configured\nAll you have to do is installed or get somebody there to help me as no big deal you can do it in less than an hour but don't let that make you believe it's not serious it's deadly serious it is serious serious it is just as effective in justice comprehensive as any other security system you would get that uses wires",

convinced that after an interaction that we would see a difference in Afghanistan we are still facing significant challenges with leadership and Afghanistan\nAnd then more if it was like you don't know who you're talking about play a twenty four if you don't mind listen to this\nWasn't about the future of Afghanistan this is about the future of America that the Taliban had harbored al ...\nAllow them to train and ready and plan to then come fly into the twin towers and Pentagon and the death in Pennsylvania this was never about turning Afghanistan into a twenty first century um you know modern democracy in the mission was about ensuring that we didn't have failed states that were safe havens\nFor terrorists entities to be able to train and grow and an attack America or or interests so\nUm you know that that has to be\nVery clear when we're making these types of decisions\nSomeone is qualified someone who's not qualified ... those two moderators never talked about the military and that's ridiculous when our debates\nOr one more twenty five Martha\nContinued and nobody asked her in the media nobody asked accused and about her flyers what she called American military members terrorists but Martha brought it up as she should here we go\nYou know when you were handing out a flyers in these multiple protests that you had at the time ... and one of them were you were to leave like your where many times you pick that our troops as skeletons and said stop the U.S terror in the middle east again this is another CNN story that was broken\nAbout this uh and so when you talk about can you you know can you separate protesting military action from denigrating are too\nIn that case they were one in the same the flyer for her protest I don't remember if that was the thing to do one or not or whether they're picking our troops as skeletons and saying we were the terrorists like I I'm not making any of this up and I think it's really important\nFor the voters to know the full history of both of our lives and what we have done with our lives right on what we put our passion into and these isn't many years cast and she's right that you were out of the mainstream uh protesting advocating the shutdown loop this entire pattern or over many many\nYeah that's right that's right\nThat's what we have listen I have to do more of this tomorrow was well I I

lot of money to make this happen there are a lot of kids by the way and the magic of the Taliban is the children as it always is there are children in the caravan and that\nIt's kind of like the baby on board science I always hated does I even had one made a baby not on board but we're still as valuable as anybody else is inside this guys we had one of those made those bother you baby on board

clues task of emergency alert system\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut who who is it they would think if you're on the left to think this massive caravan arriving in the United states at our border close to the election who's thinks this is going to help Democrats how what it does help Democrats\n\nIt's not just Trump separating him as Trump not letting them in either there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive care they don't understand that\nThis kind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected Donald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion\nImage growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just sick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them entry or\nTo separate the children from the adult so that's a drive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are already written that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan already in McCann where these people will say they're shocked they came to America to save their lives were their children and do improve their latest they won't let them in this is like anything they ever heard about\nThe cuts of pictures of Trump smiling as people are denied entry Democrats think this\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically did this it'd be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nThat we don't have anybody on our side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way\nOr am I missing something\nA massive group of four thousand people is growing including kids marching toward the United states with no attempt to making patently obvious what it is\nAre not people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing will they be fleeing poverty but that happens every day for thousands of illnesses aren't just treated it's planned it's walking paper somehow this is supposed to end up making\nThe night in states look bad that\nAh I'm not ... that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out then we have the Mueller report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations and decency and so we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of tropical to go to Russia so if Mueller's ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the that if they find these sounds I hear\nThat puts this in perspective hang on and when I look at this at won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is not pretend audio soundbite number ten and this is this is deep\nState ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room\nIs a counterterrorism center specials what he is and Blitzer said do you think that Mueller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will from Mali going over Rosenstein let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there is going to be some dirt in there so in addition to the diamond I really want to see what's in that narrative report\nHey so this\nIs wearing mission is going to Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff Trump is\nNone none of which is probably going to be indicted all none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're going to make moves in that direction anyway um but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt dirt nothing in\nWhich there is nothing less they make it up there never has been any Trump collusion and there never has been the evidence or less they make it up so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory that blamed Trump's\nIncompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being sold in over his head that it looked like the Russians had worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence\nIt's hard to refute the idea of going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his presidency because of his incompetence\nThat's what it's going to be but let's take a look at an alternative view from Sydney Powell\nWho is work we have referenced many times\nOn this program she has written a book chronicling they deception and the abuse of power but corruption in the department of justice traced all the way back to the Enron task force many of the same lawyers here we're working with Mahler\nEnter headline she published this up yesterday at the Daily Caller Mahler Xinjiang is up but that's not enough\nMeaning\nTrump still ... of the country something here despite the fact Muller hasn't found anything\nThe boiler witch hunt is effectively over writes ms Powell not because Mahler and not plan to drag this out until they could contact the crime against Trump for a member of his family but rather because the ... up\nHave you noticed how long it's been since anybody even suggested that the president's sit down with the special counsel for an interview\nMueller's reason for existing was the outrageous purposefully propagandize per verification as the Trump campaign and even Trump himself colluded with Russia to ring\nThe twenty sixteen presidential election against Hillary Clinton the Democrats who perpetrated this fraud or not only masters of rejection and deception they took their play book of personal destruction to a whole new level\n\nTalked about this whole thing with ah with handled in the interview the out the genuine out rage is this that this is the ... the literal criminal acts committed by Hillary Clinton and all of the people on her team of the Obama the OJ\nThe FBI and none of that ever investigate it and the the purpose of Mueller's investigation is to actually provide cover\nFor the real criminality that was going on\nThere is a story here from CNBC it's it's another story about the economy here and I'm frankly done that anybody in the dry visors reporting this as accurately as they are us seeing ... was rise in household well this is according to the\nCredits we uh you know we now have we have the news yesterday that we have seven million job openings and six million unemployed\nBut we're we have one million more jobs open than there are people to fill them\nWhich means it's a it's a workers market we've had a a boy's market is a story

whatever [noise]\nSo I Want to show you something of a digital camera I got an email here this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid leftist knobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses\nAnd so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs that remember we had a call here I just maybe\nThree weeks ago now from a caller who said\nRussia I'm worried I'm not seeing any yard signs we saw Trump the yard signs everywhere in two thousand\nSection you know I'm not seeing any yard signs at all I said well back camp that can't that looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that frightened\nAlso includes scaring them not to go vote there are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs and that's why\nYard signs without being put out I I was part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of yard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that storm the beaches in Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBlocked it's a different era and these people on the left her crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way\nSo I have a video taken by it Ted Cruz worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it\nTook a still shot that what a pup a pop up here just second this picture you're going to see us from a video taken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign signs in uh Houston neighborhood Montrose and there was this guy\nDemonic looking guy following the Cruz supporter around ripping up every yard sign ripping it out of the ground and then they're ripping it to shreds\nAnd at one point he stormed the Cruz supporter who was a video showing him on his camera and got this demonic threatening look on his face\nStarts shouting till the cruise support or how much she hates cruise despises grows\nAnd I've taken still shut up put it up there this is the guy that was running around taking cruise lines down ripping up out of yards\nAnd this still shot he is storming the Cruz supporter who is holding the camera he actually got within two inches of the camera I didn't know shot that point 'cause all you see is the guy's flaring nostrils\nBut this guy is out there following cruise people around taken a cruise yard signs out and then threatening\nCruise supporters who have videotape him doing this by the way this guy so long haired maggot infested rock and roll type you can see that and he's a he's wearing mustard yellow\nToo real so I'm trying to wonder why even the ... what's the purpose of this piece the left turns not that illusion they want you to know\nThey want readers to know this western is by golly by gosh for real\n\nThe sub had like many overnight sensations in has been years in the making what we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties in the Soviet Union if you want to trace the beginnings of this\n\nOver the past eight years begins and Mr Thomas Bee and sold the Democrat electorate has moved steadily to the left as liberals have displaced moderates self identified the liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democratic party\nRaising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite\nHave spread to the rank and ... on [noise]\nOn up the Democrat Party elite sad to say we're never these radical left is now I'm going back free Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken by the left wing radicals and that's why some are scratching their heads anyway\nFrom two thousand one to two thousand eight team to share a Democrat voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal he doesn't say that [noise]\nI'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four to thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent that here we go now this is a long piece but this next graph assist them money\nCrafts ready well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this they simply leftward\nAccording to Gallup the share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this growth white liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not\nBeen growing it anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrat\nWait a minute in two thousand to Lebanon white working class was totally go to hell now all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party ended the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is at a record high\nFor Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identify as liberals those percentages have not been growing anywhere near the rates that they had been for white Democrat so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly\nTo the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nIn fact says Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of the black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination\nAs a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\n\nWasting a much stronger emphasis then African Americans\nNow wait because earlier this week we had a story but the Republican Party Owens white suburban women right we did so who is who is white\nWomen making up the majority of Democrats liberalism\nWho are but back in a minute [noise] shrimp boat Rochelle may be missed word [laughter]\nOn CNN\nWide your old brutalized\nLaw enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nRather than fighting back\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nKevin McCarthy ... and did force the low back fully funds President Trump's border wall expands caseload to utilize criminal legal immigrants and insurers only American citizens have the right to vote\nConservative solution America deserves the leadership of President Trump's nice\n\nRepublican history teacher is Liz mayor said yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern\nWhen you constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it\nAnd in fact [noise] [noise]\nRight on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal they're written it was just certainly this the name of Lance tomorrow ring a bell\nTo you [noise] [noise] Lance Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in this I mean he was the premier journalists not was not an executive buddy practically ran the place\n\nI met him at Mr ... home he ... you were a good buds but land tomorrow was a a\nTypical criminalist which means means left in so far he's got a piece in the wall Street Journal\nThat is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump always concern is that Trump's\nOutrageousness no longer fuels anger on the left as it should give people just got used to it\n\nAnd then the the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing that Democrats have to get their people to the polls\n\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's miner ripper bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel Republican that maybe the headline is true the Republicans fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think\nFor a minute here there may be an isolated case of a\nSuburban woman [noise] thinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\n\nBut this election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past and have voted Republican know how important\nI just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean in a few votes here\n\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to you know lose maybe hold elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics\nAnd they assume this has it dead zip Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video in it\nThis isn't going to do it\nFrom the fuel dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration onslaught\nPresident Trump today warned that he may take military action to stop immigrants from crossing the southern border into the U.S may just not take action to stop the onslaught this is the caravan that's headed our way\nTrump railed against Guatemala Honduras and el ... saying that they have almost no control over their population\nI'm watching the Democratic party land because they want to open borders and existing week laws I'm watching a Democrat Party whether salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S [noise]\nThese people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help the Democrats get votes\n\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\n\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying\nFor this that somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking things they've got to be using\nFacilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here\nI guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who\nThinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date\nHelps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop\nSo what's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong and you put four thousand people on a track there's gotta be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incident of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse\nAnd maybe started by Trump well enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating them and maybe the Democrats things that people want to stop this chaos into this chaos is only because of the Trump that Trump weren't there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this white they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp letting him back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nThat afternoon rush hey I'm\nAs for the Hannity interviewed I'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if you didn't do than just a second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kym who's always told me to call you I should call your call you will finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up in South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them if they're not immunized and\nIf you've been low reform reports recently yeah the new diseases out called will not a new disease is a disease out that's had an outfit called ... and it's a polio like oh yeah it's the same length and also killing American\nChildren back twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen there was an outbreak ... let me say that the CDC right as of now has not said they're not sure where it came\nFrom yeah twenty fourteen twenty sixteen we had a similar outbreak yeah\nAnd I'm hiding a tough time finding the leaks out of the Internet because it's just the beginning scrubbed but on January fourth to twenty six key on a website called natural news\nThe headline read tarot virus the sixty eight linked to illegal immigration behind fatal polio like illness killing America's Choice right right right now the CDC is not coming out and people aren't coming out because it leads to much crazy to Trump's call for a while\nIf somebody was actually telling the truth and the drive by media don't you think that this would have some effect on those moms with small children\nUh yeah I Do I this is another really good point the news it's it's amazing how\nThese things remain isolated we are here in the midst of an invasion of\nPeople from various backgrounds various countries in Central America and South America\nAnd just independent leaves some days separation of part there's a story of a shockingly unforeseen increasing polio cases in the United states\nAnd the stories feature medical professionals who are stumped they can't figure out why this was happening\nThey they they can't they can't even make educated guesses as to what might be the origins of this a couple of days go\nBy and there's another story of a mass numbers of people from various parts of the country a world South America Central America there's no question these things are related well I said there's no question common sense tells you there's\nA relationship here but you're you're absolutely right there cannot be any official ... if you have the CDC or anybody else I ... the fact that the new cases of polio or other diseases that we have previously Georgian

really glad you waited high\nRush what an honor to speak yeah I've been listening to you for twenty seven years from the hundred and ten degrees son when I was in the marine corps [laughter]\nThat would be over in Iraq\nI was over in Kuwait\nKuwait famously Desert Storm yes appreciate thank you very much\nI Am a call in fact going back to the ... referrals I have a different theory on what is going on and why they're waiting I don't think they're ... they're not action and all I think if the Democrats for somehow take the house that\nMore will have a scathing report if the Republicans hold it\nLowers report will be much of nothing\nThat's really suspicious of you\nI mean what must do you think of the institutions have your government that there's this big long report that just waiting to be written based on the outcome of the electorate\nWell I think they're already written and I'm just I think he's waiting to see which one is you've got to re release\nAll you think you know you think they're both written it just determines the election outcomes determines which one he turns in\nAbsolutely more is the swap [laughter] [laughter] oh he is absolutely everything he's there to protect the ... that's ... that's the only\nReason I just uh Clinton these enter protect everybody is there to\nGet everybody yeah I'm\nOn Russia's been such an honor to listen to you for twenty seven\nYear wait a minute I Need to ask you a question if I Need a given that if you're if you if you think that Mueller has this report will the substance of it will be determined by the election outcome\nWhy wouldn't while or just just writes a Trump did it why why wouldn't he just said that they've found reasonable suggestions that there was inappropriate contact between\nRussia and the Trump got what did they can prove it or not why not just do that I mean if there is certainly this this honest which we know they are if they ... the the idea that one of them are dishonest\nYeah the idea that we're going to get an honest subset of report from this Munch which is ignoring the real criminal criminal activity which is Hillary Clinton at whole apparatus that created that dot C. A. and then tried to convert it into legitimate intelligence to get buys a warrant to spy on Trump expecting honesty out of this much\nWe don't expect honesty and the reason ... she needs the Democratic party to back up reports\nMother does mother needs Democrats back back up these reports meaning they if they win the majority of my house than they could back up a report exactly well what otherwise but what if they don't win the Senate one for Republicans hold the Senate and him even gain ground there\nWhile he just he just can't release anything here that way because there is no evidence and if the Democrats somehow when the house he he's got to have a report that's going to be ... to the president if they don't really want here much on them all\nAnd I look I I understand your thinking on this but I think the report is going to be scaling regardless\nAnd I think it's going to be gay and being in terms of the judge mental\nInnuendo I don't believe there will be any evidence of collusion because we know that it didn't happen we know that liberal writers\nOne writer spent two years the past two years researching a book he wanted to be first out of the box with a book before them on a report detailing the collusion he hasn't found a shred of evidence in two years", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "18", "locations": [["Syria", 35.0, 38.0], ["Markey", 44.35974, -84.67114], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Arizona Republic", 21.36488, -157.94996], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Pennsylvania", 39.95233, -75.16379], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["McCann", -73.56667, -77.61667], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Russia", 60.0, 100.0], ["Russia", 60.0, 100.0], ["Xinjiang", 41.5, 85.5], ["Russia", 60.0, 100.0], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["Japan", 35.68536, 139.75309], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["St Louis", 16.01793, -16.48962], ["Philadelphia", 39.95233, -75.16379], ["New York New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Toronto", 43.70011, -79.4163], ["Haiti", 19.07582, -72.29616], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["Turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["US", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["the U.

McNamara who we've had before on a show and I was listening to what he had said today and I follow him on his social media and he said something very cool this morning where\nHe is very intense individual as people that you've heard him on the show ... he says\nYou gotta wake up every morning\nWith the mentality that you have to do something to make yourself better than you were yesterday absolutely particularly when it comes to the violence that there is in this world because you can show to yourself and say there is no way that you can try to stop you could shelter your kids\nBut it's we live in a wider world and she said you have to wake up to the\nTrain in something so you could be able to kick your butt from yesterday yeah\nAnd he and and crushed says now the same thing is twice I've heard it in one day which is that's when it comes down to ... Chris we'll train you so\nSix months from now you can beat yourself up today [laughter] you know what I mean right I mean and that's what it comes down to it I think it's important\nIn the mirror everyday tied to start graying beard yeah yeah I Do with the beard [laughter] ah but do you know what I mean I think it's fantastic to see that and to hear that in in to see what options he gives agents it's another tool\nYou look at agents to carry their gun their their ass their old sea spray that ... different things here's another tool that\nYou don't have to worry about I'm a pouch to carry on your belt and it's a tool that you can carry for the rest of your life and that's what's important so I'm\nReally happy I was able to have him on I think it was fantastic\nThere's there's ... we had a ... a lot of other things planned on the show we wanted to talk about the issues of ice and all kinds of stuff I had some notes that I wrote down a on the incompetence of some leaders\nUm and I won't be able to get to those either or but it was just I I've been going through some issues were trying to deal with sector on some things and it always bothers me when\nI talk to these managers and they say well wait for an email response or I'll Wait for it and it's like your show\nWhere they are wrong and they know the wrong and you can have an another leader in that room that's\nHigher ranking that debt than them that tells them hey you're wrong right and they'll say okay that are still waiting for your email and that thing is just frustrating I've been dealing with that or they said and get your email right it's because they're scared to be responsible they're not responsible individuals\nAnd like I said before\nNot everyone but unfortunately\nUnited States border patrol continues to promote mediocrity and and I think now they're even lowering the bar and they're promoting failure which is angering me but we have a lot of good leaders to and and I'm hoping that there'll be some promotions here soon on on some leaders that I think are great leaders\nCool I Can't talk about who they are but that's I might leave it at that rented my seed folks we've come to the end of the show a thank you so much for listening to us thank you for I'm listening to a ... interview with Chris\nReach out to him he's a Tucson now you got you can add that extra tool to your belt

come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just meaning into terrorists jumpstart hell no it doesn't mean the end the tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap\nTariffs not\nHow to drive by the Democrats said that slapping tariffs on Chinese goods was gonna provoke the gigantic couldn't possibly be\nYou got it might mean the end of whatever Rangel are making what the North Koreans it might destroy existing good relations with the child comes up a breaking news China just cut import tariffs on a wide range of products China\nBut ... will cut import tariffs on textile products and medals including steel products\nTo aid for like eight point four percent down from eleven and a half percent effective November first according to the ... finance ministry yesterday\nThe checkouts have pledged to take steps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year amid rising tension with those some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started maybe and see I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs is economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work and it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one that bought it was necessary to do and it's now done here is the president\nToday at the White House Rose Garden we have three ... I have long contended\nThat NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number then that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at a loss for point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs was about twenty five percent of our order jobs even more than the\nThroughout the campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe\nEven longer than maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions but to what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing that\nDeal got done he was teaching why it was important including to the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how ... works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know we're the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take an insurance now and then it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason that we should have our back pockets picket\nThere's no reason that we should just what people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not have dams on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs in their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement does it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people didn't know what they were talking I got scared to death\nAt lesson has been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us\nThis kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nA ... or in the\nRespect of others it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump is turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nOver steel will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets it's a privilege for them to do business with us\nAnd I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody\nIt's a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly\nBut that's coming along to do business with U.S Japan every country is a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank\nYeah it's a privilege to come in now and I as I say if folks it's it's a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses without the need to apologize we really we really happened is\nYou know you can see evidence and scientists on our own culture of the achieved any accomplished somehow feel the need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it\nAs some sort of new definition of humility a rather than having used as a teachable moment if something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making that country great we want to every country putting their country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point for everybody\nTo do better but not by piggy banking the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types here's the final bite\nA don't don't forget who told you this was not possible do not forget\nIt was ... Hussein ... who said none of this could be done\nFear remember the previous administration said we're not going to have manufacturing jobs anymore essentially we're not going to have we're not going to make things anymore now\nJust the opposite going to be a manufacturing powerhouse that allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been off shored to the world because of ... fair trade issues\nSo there you have it it's um it's not a sexy\nSubject NAFTA never was I mean it was an ... commanded a lot of attention a it was very controversial when it was ratified\nIn the in the early in the mid Nineteen nineties but in terms of being a subject of cable news announcer gonna do it two or three panels tonight on NAFTA trade deal and not going to have a lot of people tune in\nJust the way of the world so Trump is making sure with this extended event in the rose garden today but people get it is important in terms of its important says that election issue it's crucial\nIt is a wouldn't say crochet but it's it's very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters stick with me I told you I was going to do that I told you it could be done and I told you the United states was going to come out as the champion in the subject the world trade don't doubt me\nAnd it wasn't from the line it's because Ryan also has the good feet or ... lifetime guarantee on those help you stay with perfect posture perfect bounce pain goes away granting swan right next to bed bath and beyond eight hundred new for good feed yards sports store [noise]\nFox News I'm Debbie hand like a limousine on its way to a birthday party in upstate New York blew a stop sign Eighteen people in the limo and to pedestrians were killed the accident occurred in ...

me I wouldn't jeopardize but the things I Want to get to hear a and I can just as easily relate what the president said he just laying the Democrats out he was laying them out for the lying\nTrickster isn't skunks that they are he is linking the media to the Democrat Party which uh\nWe do with all the time here but uh you don't really hear the president or make it that direct about\nMe as he has just even Mr rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal Dianne Feinstein or what have you with Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how when the world that Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it ... we're made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written in the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line in the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public so people\nWere trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a note ringer it's so unfair it starts button light\nAnd it became\nObvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and that was all the other possibilities\nWere mentioned she eventually asked for point of order the German Grassley and and said uh\nInteresting I I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrageous allegations that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff in any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter]\nBut what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't hear what she said because it's off Mike but she's obviously asking them at anybody here in a leak it she turns or did you look at the ... she turns back to the camera we need to make it\nThis is a German we didn't leak it and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say always this how we're going to determine who leak something she gets so turned her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it\nAnd Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your leaked this letter and like oh no I don't know what was the last one to ... she turns back around so we we didn't do it and listen to him and as the case closed it wasn't us they had done it it was strategic just like what happened on friday was to teach it\nStrategic ladies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript\nOf a conference call that have occurred last week among and between Democrat activists who were planning exactly what happened on friday it's laid out in this thing now unfortunately I Can't reproduce this and put it at Rush Limbaugh dot com because I don't legally habit\nBut I've got it I'm not going to mention any names but the names of the Democratic front groups in organizations are here and the strategies that they use and it makes it crystal clear that they were going to target Jeff Flake\nThat he was seen as the most malleable and the easiest to intimidate the elevator\nIncident where it just happens\nThat to nearly insane anti Kavanaugh pro democratic activist ended up there in flakes elevator with us CNN camera right there to catch what happened and they started shouting they started accusing and they started pointing fingers he got scared to death\nIt was all part of the strategy to turn him\nAnd it was there was there was a three point strategies a flake strategy was number three if the other two had bombed out\nAnd they made it they pulled it off they did it\nJohn Fund has a piece today at National Review who was behind the flakes set up\nAcorns tactics live on and the
