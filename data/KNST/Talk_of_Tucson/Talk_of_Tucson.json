C. C. uh the the actual program starts about six thirty but those dinner and dancing to follow okay oh what a great opportunity to come out and have some\nFun yeah isn't anybody so you're listening right now someone listening day can say I love the military I Want to go to the good night out I can support and we'll find out what it's going to do and what its support anybody can just\nAnybody can buy a ticket or in fact there um our tickets still available right now if you go to a Tucson YMCA dot org or then you can find some tickets there are but you can also or pay at the door for this event as I Believe ah ah the tea cc is such a big venue that there'll be seats for everybody\nOkay now uh now I mean is there are certain could address that needs 'cause it's\nKind of a it's a ball yeah it is a it is a formal ballgame and one of the reasons that it is formal is because of the recognition of our nation's military and it gives a\nThe military I'm a representative was an opportunity to put on their dress blues and ah and I say blues because I'm an air force guy we were going to get it and uh and uh but it's a great opportunity for them to also ah come out in a celebrated with us but\nI recognize the fact that uh I'm In being able to participate with the military or it is a high honor ... so that's why are they a high dress yes is one of those\nThings and that's where the gallons or ... or ... you know what a this is one of those are\nGreat opportunities are geared for our guys are like us to take out our ladies are in um give them a great date night out yup and give them a chance to to wear that ah that ball a I'm\nA fashion that they had been waiting to pull out of the closet and ah so you could be a winner on both fronts need to be a winner with your hunting and you can also recognize the military at the same\nTime exactly exactly and again we're going to throw this out\nThe entire interview to Tucson YMCA dot org yes to find out more information about the military bulge takes place on November the tent at the tea see see 'em and before we get into what happened to the ball and the seating rages on it and it gets really cool not the money that is he's collected what is the benefit what is it going to do\nUm here's a one of the great things about the ball also too is not only is it a fund the evening but it's an opportunity for people to actually give back to those members of the military or many of whom and as we approach Twenty years of\nDeployments in Afghanistan yeah or Twenty years of deployment as we of course I have wild down things in Iraq but Twenty years of actually being at war\nOr the longest period in our nation's history the longest period than the two hundred and forty plus years of this grand experiment that we called America\nYou have an opportunity and we all have an opportunity to recognize those folks who have many of them had multiple deployments to defend these great freedoms that we have here in this country but also to have an opportunity to be able to celebrate the fact that ah those freedoms continue\nThat went on to talk about the deployments and um but some of the things that that are involved in this to the money raised yes goes towards the families right they get to use\nThat it gives them an opportunity to get free memberships or early in the house so to actually get subsidized memberships to the YMCA or gives them a chance to uh\nSome even to a of their kids to get an opportunity to get free swim lesson allow uh so uh you can just imagine that Garrett being a dad yourself\nOf or the benefit of being able to um take your kids are too many of the uh facilities are of the YMCA but they're getting them to have the opportunity to learn how to swim\nIn fact a Garrett I've got a personal story that um that's where I learned how to swim myself really I was at the YMCA and in fact the first place I ever saw an indoor pool in my life was that the\nUh blend veal YMCA and Cleveland, Ohio don't get a growing up as a kid and a Garrett I come from very humble beginnings and the and I can personally tell you that are more than likely we could not afford it membership\nOr someone actually had to pay for us and and pay for me and I'm Glad they did because that was a transformational experience for me as a youngster and so just imagine now here's an opportunity for someone to do likewise right here in Tucson as other than there is\nOnly get paid back they can they get paid back this way you're listening to is the talk of Tucson I'm Garrett Lewis I Am in here in Studio\nOr with Tony ... who is the presidency of the United way who's involved will get to the United way as well and also a veteran thank you so much for your service will talk about that as well and this is all for\nThe military ball that's going to take place on November tent at the T. C. C. and you can get more information again at a Tucson YMCA dot org you can even buy tickets they uh get information that you might think it's at the door that night but it's a bully to look good\nI can be a lot of fun but speaking of the points I mean\nPeople get deployed sometimes for a year at a time yes I mean that is a long time to be without your family\nIt is um and you can imagine are the issues that uh uh these those kinds of extended separations can call yeah ah and ah but the great thing about um the YMCA is that it has a long history of being able to support the\nUm the families who are sometimes left behind ... and ah so the YMCA becomes a hub a and an opportunity for these families to go find other\nFriends are and to also be able to find some really community resources that they need to be able to help them a go through the hardship of deployment and just thinking about a good many of 'em are people who are part of a\nCritical jobs within the military have multiple deployments yes over the last Twenty years\nI don't think that there's any way we can every pay these families for the sacrifice name has she'll just to be able to to give something back and they can find some some\nGreat entertainment ... I'm ... to take their mind off of things have can't imagine like wake up every day and wonder where where is my my other half where's my dad where's my mom\nAnd I see these videos on the news of when uh the moms or the dad come back and he surprised the kid at school and the kids just tear up and I mean any of watching it on on line and watch it on these if it's incredible it'll you know I Can't even imagine how appreciative also and they\nThey are because they're great people who have pre should have the military families are do after you get this kind of a\nAbsolutely they are Garrett and you can actually see it on their faces a I've had the pleasure of not only are being honored this time around at this great event but I've attempted to you that I'm I'm several times over the course of a\nA having a chance to be a part of this community here in Tucson and and it's an enjoyable event because you can actually see\nUm how much of the military uh and their families really appreciate the the recognition and um it's great to be able to feel that in the room it's almost palpable there and really the evening and so a\nNight right it is they get to be the star is it absolutely is they get to dress up and like you said in the news for you\nYou and and yeah and they always look so short hair you know it's almost intimidating that aspect of it is but I got to tell you after\nWe go through the ... a\nA a a really um a ceremonial part of the vet or they get the let their hair down because uh there's always a great band that comes up or that starts to play right after the program ends\nAnd die if you get to let you down and and have a great meal on top of it they have served fantastic food at the event uh and then you get to dance so uh I really enjoyed taking my ah taking my wife out and having an opportunity to be able to get out on the dance floor with her too\nWell tell me about the ceremony tell tell me what happened to the ceremony\nUm it is a one of those things that are will make your heart soar", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Talk of Tucson", "city": "Tucson", "day": "27", "locations": [["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Cleveland Ohio", 41.4995, -81.69541], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["Tucson, AZ", 32.22174, -110.92648], "in_country": ["Tucson", "Tucson", "America", "Cleveland Ohio", "Tucson", "Tucson", "Tucson", "Tucson"], "out_country": ["Afghanistan", "Iraq"], "in_state": ["Tucson", "Tucson", "Tucson", "Tucson", "Tucson", "Tucson"], "out_state": ["Afghanistan", "Iraq", "America", "Cleveland Ohio"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "Good morning they'll tell us more about hope fest\nOh ho has is an amazing event um it's your every single year it's an annual event this is er twenty six year here in Tucson that it's basically the easiest way to describe it it's a one stop shop for those that are struggling\nHomelessness low income families ... you can come there for emergency services which is basic necessities of life\nAnd you can also connect with over a hundred different programs and organizations that are there for for ongoing care\nOkay and how long this has been in Tucson ...\nWhen when he's six year ... started in the wind yeah it's been a while we started it in Phoenix or how it's going to Prescott so it's kind of growing up but you know I once again is the birthplace writing grapes\nAnd ah you're at a new location this year it's called the center of opportunity now what is the center of opportunity\nYeah the center of opportunity is an amazing project um we were gifted it's the old Holiday Inn and holiday hotel on south ... and many people are familiar with that the hotels in Tucson for a long time there is not one person I take their that's like\nOh I had my problem here I had my family revolved ... attached\nTo that ... but a local philanthropist um ...

I'm from Tucson Hi these are kids that really wanted there was a niche that need to be filled\nAnd you're saying over about over two hundred fifty cyclists are going to participate in this year alone\nIn the fall Fonda yes or no um and that's not counting the kids and the families and all the volunteers takes to make it happen too so\n... founded fourteen years ago how has it grown like obviously there was a natural attraction like these people these kids coming up and saying I Want to ride bikes to how many kids are you serving now in ...\nYeah so it started on my back porch fourteen years ago with about five kids and we now have a downtown warehouse space that is a over seven thousand square feet inside we have a shot or a hundred and twenty kids and weekly program and we serve about one thousand three hundred kids a year so it's grown tremendously\nAnd you're in the schools and stuff do you work with different school I've salute\nLee yeah so we do outreach events at schools we actually run now an after school bike club at moms do elementary it's just over a mile from our clubhouse so it's right in our backyard um there are a great school that has really collaborated with us so twice a week\nWe have bikes at the school we're on a a club there and then kids from other programs of ours going help assist the staff and so it's part of that use empowering other used to get excited about by\nYou and I see that you're doing that provide scholarships community school programs value based programs sporting\n... yeah absolutely and sometimes these you'd still have access to bikes you help provide them with bicycles and so ...\nSo we are extremely fortunate that we have such a generous Tucson community and uh the majority of the bikes that all the kids ride of and donated from individuals and uh\nFrom individuals either donated their bike or donate money so that we can get bikes that fit kids especially younger kids it's hard to find donated quality kids' bikes so we've had to use grant money and donor money to to buy those but then it makes that experience for the kids so much more powerful\nAnd you have like different levels of bicycle riders\nAbsolutely yeah so some kids will start with us in our summer by can't program a we'll have a hundred and fifty kids come through every June and by camps and we teach kids how to ride every summer or we're working with kids that already know how to ride and they're elevating their skills\nAre and then within each program we kind of break it down into like an A. B. C. so\nA being like I'm more experience than I Want to take my game higher CBD and maybe I'm a newer writer and I'm learning and I'm gaining endurance and strength\nAnd all that stuff riding a bike it's such a memorable experience I think we can all look back at the time when we clicked and we're like to ride a bike now like that's a vivid memory totally and it builds confidence like you were saying it's more than just bike riding you're also developing skills for these you\nAbsolutely I think that's the thing that that I personally pride myself on the most is the story is that kids come back and tell you know three four years after they've left the team after they graduated from high school and say\nMan when I was studying for the exam and I was really stressed out and life was hit me in the face I remembered ride my bike in the desert three am at the twenty four hour racing going like I could do that I can do this you know so it's about helping them make those connections to like what you gain on the bike and how you use it off the bike\nAlso helped create diversity within our community as well and I'm sure that that you see that yeah for the last few years as well with these kids absolutely\nWe've got kids you know from on just email group we have forty two kids on the ... and they're coming from over a dozen different schools\nRight so you got kids from the south side ride inside shoulder to shoulder with kids from the north side and the west side and the east side right you bring these people together and the bike becomes is common denominator you know or they can like work together doesn't matter where you come from\nIn the physical activity like it's it's almost unintentional like getting kids active yeah and being outside which I think is really hard nowadays there's like beyond their eye pads and be inside so to bring them out and pull them out to appreciate the beauty of Tucson on a bike is awesome\nYeah absolutely I think one of the things that are a different uh supporters of really taken too is like we collect kids phones when we get into vans and we drive\nToo is that right now you're going to talk to each other you're going to play cards they don't know where that is so well they do and I think one of the things that we do a little differently is like recognize that kids are\nAre naturally capable right and it's just about helping them tap into that knowing they're going to make mistakes but like supporting them through the process of learning and you know becoming a better adults\nRight well it's so you were saying earlier that these bikes are all donated or you get grants and they'll how how does your funding work since you're a non profit how absolutely\nWill get the full pie chart you know as a non profit right away it takes everything to to make it run and him since we've done nothing but grow it's like we've got\nAn awesome community of supporters that donate goods and bikes but also cash a we're now a qualified charitable organization is I'm seeing here yeah your tax credit dollars will now go to this it's huge and it's been great for us it just happened last year and um we think it's going to be transformative and helping to reach low income kids right\nAt school that I mentioned Ninety percent of the kids at school qualify for free and reduced lunch right now that's a big deal so it's a big deal and it's an opportunity they wouldn't otherwise have so we're able to do that now\nAs we get those donations in and and with a tax credit it's kind of a no brainer like you're going to have to spend the money and send it somewhere so you can direct it you know to a cause that you believe in like ...\nWe're talking with Danielle or she is co founder and executive director of ... as well\nSo uh so let's let's circle back now to the big event the fall for our own image Rosie right falls on do fall Fonda yes so this is the fifth and a little bit and you'll do and I'm looking here\nYou get to pick your distance on this right I'm looking for the thirty five miles on horses about what you get out of me because I'm just I've ...

Shaikh adds a is the chair\nOf she's on classics car show and ... is the president and the Rotary Club of Tucson so shall we start talking about the Rotary Club and the events that you put on throughout the shall we just go right into the Tucson classics ...\nWell I think unless it let's go into the car show that the news it's only in almost you know less than two weeks and Bruce and the team and then working all year long on this and so Bruce what do you want to say about the show well\nThe first thing I Want to say is uh if you haven't been you need to turn out is uh as\nYou mentioned as we've been doing this is all they are twelve their annual ah it's our signature fundraising event that we do every year\nSo far in the past eleven years we've ah raised a little over a one point two million dollars and uh we're excited the last couple of years as we've been able to get our net for our charities up to about a hundred and Seventy five to two hundred thousand a year\nGosh that's great and so it's Saturday on ... for it and it's at that Gregory school\nCorrect the regular school ride off of Craig cropped up by the reach a river or the ... the host of our show since we started\nYeah and we didn't say it's been forever he's been there and\nWe have almost twenty thousand people who turn out so you know four hundred and twenty classic cars everybody comes to the cars they're they're terrific there there are you know that's our customer the cars that come out and we try to take care of them but they're beautiful cars all different types\nOf vintage most of them Nineteen Seventy nine and older and people come out and there's food and activity and Bruce until you know and all of that has all kinds of fun that goes on during the day\nYeah well it was as Chuck mentioned we have somewhere around twenty thousand people would end up turning out for the event um we do want to mention that there is a there's on site parking uh we do charge for parking at seven dollars per car um as far as admission goes is that\nIt gets which are raffle tickets but also service your mission it's five dollars a ticket and for um kids that are under Eighteen as long as there with a paid adult is they're able to come in for free\nBut you know the one thing I'll say about what these raffle tickets we also have a number of people that they might buy five ten fifty of these tickets just to submit them for the rap also\nUh we certainly appreciate that kind of community sport support in are raising money for the charities\nAnd that raffle which you win for what we were apple every year as a Corvette we've had twelve different Corvettes it's a new Corvette every year or this year it's our best Corvette yet it's a two thousand five only forty thousand miles on it

where can they get the tickets in advance\nBest location is to go to our website which is a tea CCS a classic scar show and you can purchase tickets on line\nOf there are tickets that you can purchase the day of the show as well um so whatever works out for people are obviously I think that a lot of people know we have over a two hundred and twenty members of the Rotary Club Tucson\nAnd I think

retail river right\nThere you go and you can buy your tickets now also a lot of people are on social media you know like Facebook and I did notice that you guys do have a Facebook page an event page so if you want to get more information they can also go to your Facebook page\nYeah fake Facebook we in the last few years we definitely had been trying to uh up our game as far as social media so to speak\nAnd uh so I think that that's a great opportunity to just be able to look for the Rotary Club two sons Facebook page and like it and you'll get plenty of information um I Know last year they actually did some live streaming during the during the event itself\nSo I Know that there's plans to do that again this year as well\nBut you know one other thing I wanted to mention is you know a Chuck talked about it being a family friendly\nEvent I think even for people that are not um you know what I call ... ... people I think whether you're talking about little kids or adults is just walking around and looking at these classic cars is they really are amazing I'm obviously there's plenty of people that are ... people that\nUh you know they want to know just you know what's the size the engine and what was the restoration but\nUm besides that we do have a area for the kids um we have a DJ out there uh playing fifties and sixties DJ John\nUm and obviously we're making announcements throughout the day uh we have a food court ah this year uh I'm trying to remember I think we're up to ten different ah food vendors that are there and so when people come in if they want to purchase anything or food or drink\nIs a we have a token booth um so it's not cash sales there so they have to purchase their tokens or to be able to purchase any food or beverage be able to drink\nAnd Twenty one and older we have beer available as well uh so nothing like a great you know\nKind of day in October ... and having a beer and looking at great cars and it's a it's it's terrific
