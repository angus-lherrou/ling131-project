radio station [noise]\nThe deadliest transportation accident in the U.S in nearly a decade I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News twenty people killed in a crash involving a limo in upstate New York\nHe was worried that the bill would have unintended consequences right\nAs these three for nine would have prohibited the civil arrest of any one in uh California court house\nWhile attending a court proceeding or having legal business in that court\n\nLet that sink in a ... it would have ... prohibited it though right so there's the problem everyday in\nEvery court house in the United states thousands of people are subject to civil arrests for violating all manners of laws in court orders\nHad asked me three for nine been signed into law by governor moonbeams brown\nCalifornia would have shot itself in the foot and hobbled both its court systems and many of its own law enforcement agencies\n'cause just anyway somebody showed up for a court trial and they had a warrant\nThen they wouldn't be arrested right\nOh wow so he so see but the way they pushed it ... the way they wrote it they thought it was just going to affect illegal aliens mhm but no I was going to go as it was going to\nFall on across the board right right and that would have been like disastrous for California\nSo but what's most disturbing is asked me three ... isn't the virtual singing signaling incompetence that led to its veto rather what happened is if the bill hadn't inconvenienced California courts\nAnd Ken of for California law enforcement\nGovernor moonbeams he would have signed that law wow and then you know he would have done so knowing full well that ... you know sanctuary state legislation\nThe bill was both on constitutional\nAn egregious and an egregious violation of the principles of federalism on which the United states was\nBuilt they haven't\nOh because the people currently running California care one way more about illegals access to\nCourts than they do about the safety of the United states of America and the United states citizens that's what it comes down to what we\nWeren't they also looking at something where there was going to be no more bail depending on the area of the kinds of\nStupid stuff there I mean it's just yeah I don't get it and I don't understand where these politicians come up with this it's bothersome um and we were talking about it earlier ... before we were on the air and you were talking so there's a lot of things that people don't understand\nIs that is an issue this being one of them ... years and and I'm cool you know I understand the help other people out in and I get that but do you do help others out\nBy sacrificing your own yeah you know what I mean it it's ... it's like gold or Francis Francis down during Texas little France's maple yeah people call him he's not really but yeah so so Francis O'Rourke um\nHis big push to be a veto veto veto veto veto\nThere you go [laughter] and they came up with that one [laughter] we didn't do veto being so um yeah he wants to push this whole um\nFree access of a college tuition for illegal aliens\nSo realistically even those people that are super far left leaning right than even if you got to sit there and be upset because I Know not everyone can go to school\nI mean it is what it is right I mean you better yourself and you do stuff and there's grants you can apply for and there's ways you can move forward there's\nYou have options right in the end you're going to have to pay back of course because nothing's free but this guy wants to go ahead and give it free to illegal aliens I think anybody would be a little bit of golf college yeah college yeah but ...\nAlso want to go that can't get funding right here that were born here\nOr right it's just I don't\nGet it but here you have here you have you know moon beam and veto veto Francis veto Francis veto and and moon being brown and\nThe Bernie Sanders and my personal favorites the man with this stash that won't go away our very own ... so [noise]\nGrow grow and he was a music [noise]\nAnother town politician\nWho is way more interested in illegal aliens\nAnd possible voter\nBase that they would form in the future rather than the citizens of the of our own country in this case being California hardworking taxpaying everyday citizens of cars I've met some people from Kelly\nIn the Central Park and and they're very very conservative they are not like a lot of\nPeople would think there do you guys need to vote moonbeams out\nRestore some semblance of sanity in California in sunny California so quite some time ago and I don't remember the show we had my love black belt\nJujitsu ninja he was my ... to a structure he moved to Colorado but we also had our very own uh the Tucson pride\nBorder patrol agent ...\nCroissants Rivera yeah now I'm pretty sure at the time we had him here he had just got it in his purple belt so we're going to bring them on\nHe's an agent is important people need to know what's were found what we do and I think it's a fantastic time to be moving in mind is just the rights really fast with ... you're listening to the green light [noise]\nIf it weren't for the union the American public the people who still respect law and order and the people who still respect this nation would have no information basically a court you guys are very alone you have every force in this country mobilized against you for political reasons\nWhen it's about more than words or pictures when I go to the spot where the border patrol agent was murdered where one was was I Believe lord\nTrapped and killed and so I Walk up to pass that I think that that the agent would have taken and then there's this American flags around his his memorial [noise]\nAnd I go up to this large cross all I'm saying is is do you find her and there's the slap of does this piece of laminated paper flapping in the wind that you can't see what it says so I'm I'm looking through this you find her and I looked up at the top of the cross and I go back down and when I straighten out this piece of paper\nIt's a picture of him holding his kids is and I'm Sorry [noise]\nSaid um we love you pop you know and that just right there it was just like\nSo real to me when it's about exposing the truth\nAnd getting the story right\nBreitbart Texas\nTexas federal wellness center founded with a vision based on principles focused on superior healthcare utilizing a combination of physical medicine physical therapy and surgical expertise visit the website at Texas F. W. C. dot com [noise]\nAnd now back to the green [noise]\n... C I F ... can be a little bit better than I brought us\nInto the show yes you didn't like the whole welcome and working in the end of your room it was okay it's ... it's October\nHalloween or how about your show you or I was going for that spooky feel yeah you know I'm\nSo but I promise I told you guys I Would get a guest on I think it's an awesome yes I'm very excited to have him on but I kinda messed up the beginning in ... in the introduction\nBefore the break you never miss I did this time at least that I just I said his last name directly to doubt it um but one of the issues that we've had is obviously I I dropped the ball when was the last names but I didn't do it this time\nWhen I dropped the ball and it is I kind of removed just rank a little bit so we had responses river on the show before and I said it was back when he had his purple belt\nBut we've talked during the break and I stand corrected he had his brown belt already a which is pretty cool um and and ... and ... and I'm Glad to have him on because\nWe we go back on the show and I and I wanted to talk to Chris and\nExplain what he had been going through and what he's he's done so far within Brazilian jujitsu right and Chris\nAnd I knew what you guys you're there's sometimes when you talk about martial artist but I've met a lot of martial artist in my life because I've been involved in different types I've never reached the levels that our guest has reached but I've met a lot of people [noise] and\nNot all of them are humble some of them can be jerks to be honest I'm now they're very high level guys within Brazilian jujitsu then I have ... or the nicest most humble guys you've ever met me how I met some jerks well no\nWhere you have to defend yourself or your family\nAnd it doesn't you don't need to be law enforcement that's what's important right but I Need you to explain these guys the reality of yeah you have done you have weapons\nAnd maybe you won't achieve a black belt maybe you will or maybe it won't but why is it important that you do training or something and why specifically and I know what I'm hearing a lot of you\nBut why specifically the ... or anything else\nWill like um like kind of like kind of a reference we've made to the beginning to to um\nTo the original USC a that's a fight like we like I mentioned earlier or especially whether it's on during the off duty or\nNine times out of ten or in my experience it's going to\nEnd up on the ground so I'm not not just for the fact that like to to learn how to of course it's awesome to stick to stick to it in and learn you know all the all there is to learn the basics but I'm\nOf course you don't use it basically in as far as the law enforcement perspective I'm not going to I'm not going to sit there and want to fight somebody on the ground because I Know I Know uh\nI Know digits of meetings that that ah that defense that I Know to be able to stand up and get back to my feet to\nTo be able to see my surroundings I mean obviously not controlled environment\nYou're like a lot of competition there is not going to be another attack or another assailant it's just you against your own but I'm On the streets for example with you know you're at the movie theater or you're in the field or whatever um you don't know what else is going to be around so um I always tell\n'em people that\nThe reason I Do it um for work or for like in in the scenario that I just talked about is to be able to\nTo know how to for example the skates from no somebody mouse and you fall down and somebody ends up on top of me you know you their basic very basic movements that you can apply to get out of them opposition and be able to eventually get your feet to you know three chicken soup terrier and reach your\nYou know whatever your ass on in the middle seat or whatever you cherry but um that's that's kind of way\nI'm what I'm referring to that does that make sense to what you were asking\nNo it definitely makes sense because I think that's important that people people understand and and I know we talked about it when we weren't when we went on you and you had said\nYou know what you learn in a couple of months down alone can help you make genetically yeah for\nSure I mean just just to name just a sentimental sort of a of a a digits who are are like four to six months I always tell some I always tell people especially beginners that\nI'm forty six months of digits who is it's like night and day is against somebody that doesn't know anything if you moved to the future you stick to it for four to six months and that you as if you find yourself in you know four months back or six months that you would just demolish\nYour your past self and that's kind of a a I mean it's kind of silly to think of it that way but that's kind of ... it really all states and and you know the basics is are are very based it there's\nA very basic movements that you can now that you can do to accomplish a\nOr to be able to stand back get back to your feet and out and the guy who over at um like especially I don't know about other stations but at our station um the guys that are actually doing their going now they're kind of find that stuff um in in our use of force thing\nThe only issue is you know you know the lack of participation in the ... the lack of motivation of of a lot of the agents not just and not just that is that once every quarter is is just not enough to\nBe able to dash something yeah that is why are like that\nYeah you know what I mean it's just not enough time to to one hour or whatever it is that they showed the technique that those guys are showing a lotta times are are effective in and very basic but um if you're on the drilling that for thirty minutes or whatever they do sometimes is classes are like Fifteen twenty\nTwenty people you know that they use force classes and that's just too many people for help to be able to drill it and then like I like I said the lack of motivation sometimes\nAnd uh it's it's it's not enough ah so I always talk about um how you should at least do something what what anything or like you said like you did karate or whatever or um\nEven like just go and do some cross that or or whatever you know what I mean just act as to where you're not going to be um you're not going to put yourself in a situation where you can't even get your feet NATO\nWas that was that your little shout out to our good friend Ryan is that what you said CrossFit\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah what do they hide [laughter] I won't make you laugh that really got out of it right yeah I Love ... uh but yeah it\nIs it's funny you mentioned that when a but no you're right and and I think that's always been my gripe I guess you would say people used to say oh well aren't you know he's bringing the union thing issues complaining about how how the how the um use of force is going but that was my gripe that you got guys that are not really in shape\nOr not that I'm saying that they're out of shape but you know what I mean not I guess they're they're physically not trained or prepared for some of the moves that they may be shown in the use of force when it comes to like the ... the defense most\nThat's one of those things so you go full force at one time and you can get hurt because you don't have the technique\nDown and and then in the end\nYou're only doing it like once a quarter for Fifteen twenty minutes you're not really going to it's not going to help you what's going to hurt you more than they help you that's why it's important to go find someone and actually do the training\nAnd I think a lot of the times we hear cruise a lotta times is obviously the money issue people say oh well it's kind of expensive I'm not sure well I mean I think your life is is ... ... it is worth more than what you're gonna spend\nYeah that's for sure that's that's definitely true I mean I'm not a thing that we're talking about teaching classes I can show it has nothing to do with uh the the use of force training that we that the guy do on a quarterly basis I teach a class over at\n... at the station now I'm a condition for combat as instructor also so I teach a class\nSo we actually have um three days a week Monday Wednesday friday but I teach out of the room the friday class and those are also available to to uh um agents are and it's part of the the what is it called the ... or whatever\nThe workout rancor workout program and you do it over\nAnd those are free you know that doesn't cost anything um and and it's it's it's you know conditioning for combative than we do some you know some striking some round stuff and I'm\nSo there's there's several people several regulars that we have that that take advantage of that but I Wish there was always I always wish there was more\nBut that's what I like to know what what what David have you guys are doing it Chris\nA Monday or Monday Wednesday Fridays on Mondays is a one or the other condition for combat as instructor I'm using the ... got to he does really good at a a boxing drills he's a he's more boxing oriented right but he does a lot of a lot of drills or um\nOr with a with a boxing base so those are really good in the classes are only an hour long a seven to eight um and then Wednesday's my in my class and he's uh Wednesdays is more like um the way I Do my class I kind of try to mix it up and do a little bit around a little bit of standing\nAt the end they do a little circuit I'm trying to simulate a like a a Fifteen minute fight mhm ah three three five rounds at the end and you start\nLittle circle you know like maybe like some some bag work some you know some ground and pounding the dummy some battle ropes and you know little things like that to just get to get the blood flow in a lot of people that I Know I'm always throwing but I'm always invite you write for class and and um and you know I I like\nI even tell them if you want to just come watch you know for five minutes at the end like state can see him and it's just the people from out you know from all all um experience levels you don't have to have you know like you have to do a lot of drinking it's actually better when you when you're not experience because\nI like I tell these guys a lot of the guys and gals I'm\nIt's better to\nNot have any experience for us because you don't develop any bad habits kind of right being um arranging my when when you have all these by British out all these different guns but I'm so they develop bad habits from other weapons or just bad habits from shooting and all it's the same thing with um with this you know we\nAre and then I tell people you you just go at your own pace you actually need to take a break of eating just stop stop and nobody's going to yell at you know ready nobody's pressuring just want you to get your heart rate going in\nAnd develop a little bit of technique nighttime there incorporate a playground stuff on Fridays class it's a it's ... it's really kind of morphed into a or did you get to craft I've been doing it since two thousand twelve and and um\nThe friday classes all did you do with the games with the ... it's not you know it's not mandatory but\nThat's what we we mostly where I'm On a friday class so that one was pretty cool because we get we actually get a lot of a high level guys that come in and and I trained with us there's a there's a guy out of a sudden we have another canine hardly who's a very a", "station": "KNST", "city": "Tucson", "locations": [["Fort Lauderdale

so as I as a person would call and they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question though she they had the the canned answer that I've already given\nBut of course are those should include both of those dirty flushing yeah ... and say\nHere's the reason why I'm hesitating that\nIs that I think if you were dealing with a product okay\nAnd I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product but you're also providing a very personalized service right\nBut and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor I'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my role hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the website and see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available for me to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office said you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact uh getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on but I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert\nTo a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different shed depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your side from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the site or somebody building for you\nAh yes well the the we do at the ... already been billed than we have another company building a another website ... but but when the media but third tempting is calling me about that in the ... function I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet\nI Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters the kind of questions you get and then you can also listen to those questions under ... choose as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] [noise]\nIt won't be forty five degrees you know we don't want our quarters\n\nWe'd already indicated

I Know you can make that difference and it's important and I think it's important for the listeners especially those up there in your district right right they did there was an importance right now we're we're in in a in a position as we said the midterms don't really bring people out\nBut the people that are filled with hate right now are going out to vote so it's important that they go out and they make sure and it's just like it's a simple district nine\nFor there you go that's it just ... if it's Hillary it's any that pretty dirty damn easy yeah you just say for are just like the car except it ends in a\nConnect the dots connect the lines and you're done what I put it in the envelope\nSo what are you seeing you know you've seen down there the issues obviously the the camps are a huge issue right like I said before it operating bases um and I know I'm not going to put you on the spot because I Know that people were going to do this unity what are you gonna do I mean you're coming into it but you're coming into it I Believe\nThat you will maintain that door open door policy was\nAbsolutely you know and as we talked about in the car I mean first of all I Want to say first of all I Want to thank the national border patrol council further endorsement I Am incredibly proud humbled means the world to me I'm yeah I'm a native Arizona right I was born and raised here of lived on the border you bend in Mexico many times as a kid as an adult\nWhat the border patrol folks are doing the agents are doing they're they're risking their lives every day you know their their main to keeping that then green line and so I have the utmost respect and admiration for border patrol sort of have their endorsement especially the first time candidate means autonomy\nI appreciate having I I Want I Want to just let you roll with the Mike in aspirin to listeners out there the importance of of of the vote the importance of voting the right way\n... this is your voice the vote is your voice and again I think all of us that have worn the uniform like we talked about earlier you we understand that we go out we do the mission for whichever elected leader that we have and we always do a good job and we always you know\nYou know followers but but we have to do is to vote is the opportunity to decide which of those people are going to be you know set in the mission given us the resources have in our back you know all the top cover and\nAnd it it's a big big difference in two thousand Eighteen the difference between me and my opponent my opponent hasn't even said he wants\nA physical barrier on reporter that's crazy ... yeah and it might not have like walls that his home must just be like a rough with colors you know what people we've talked about this you know everybody has a lock on their front door and it's not because\nYou you dislike people or anything it's just because it's the ... you know everybody has what you do it because it's a way to keep your family safe and secure ... and I said at a you know\nI said a lot you know I don't like my front door because I hate the people outside it's 'cause I Love the people inside a certain you know one of the things you lay you alluded to you know you go back to Congress and you'd be won a foreigner thirty\nFive people so that the the big thing is one first of all I'm going to Congress out of service I'm not going to Congress because I'm termed out of my regular job like my opponent is or because I Want a promotion\nI like my job you know I work at a trauma center I get to save lives every day which is a blessing and I had a gift to be able to do that sort of thing 'cause I'm a doctor by Iraq onto so for the listeners who didn't know that so I have a job I Love I'm doing this because\nSo we need to have people need a voice and they need representatives there and one of the things I'll do when I get to Congress is I Will talk to every\nOf every other of those four thirty four people and ask them to take the the tour to walk the the fence line that I just walked with you because there is no substitute for that you got to walk that and you gotta walk with somebody like you so you can see\nThe reality of the situation on the ground and that's one of those things again that you know we have fewer veterans in Congress than we've ever had in the history of the country oh wow that's shocking yeah Eighteen percent in the Nineteen seventies it was Seventy five percent in the house eighty one percent in the Senate now it's Eighteen percent\nSo again it just I I think people are well intentioned but they don't know what they don't know and one of the things you learned working up the ranks twenty five years in uniform is you gotta walk in the navy we say you know you've got to take things down to the plate you got to walk the spaces which means you don't just sit up there on the you know in the captain's\nMess and just how the people tell you what's going on down in the engine room you got to get down there in the engineering and you're going to say I was like a lot of border patrol leadership needs to go through the navy for us in figured I went out and I tell you that when you see it when you lay your own eyes on it and it will likely said you gotta drive that highway when you drive that highway and you see that\nYou know there's a you know an or preserve on the you know I'm ... and there's a reservation on the west side and you see that and you see it with a military mind and you say this is a court or of entry\nYeah this is a tough area to to patrol and to keep safe and then forty percent of the drugs coming into the United states are coming through those court or\nIt's insane like Americans don't know about the people on the other side do\nRight now or do they know like their current ... this is their career right and they don't have a retirement plan\nSo they're just they just keep working in that area I tell you that's an important and you know I think it's important and I am very happy that you say you going to go back and talk to you know the other four hundred plus yeah that would hold the same position as you because we have guys right on that congressman that are right from the border in really close and they don't show up was that guy's name was the big issues in the red nose what's his name off\nRight we have that guy you know\nHe he doesn't go out there he hasn't really reached out\nTo a counselor and I said you know yeah we may not agree with things but I'll take them out there and I'll show you understand it from a military\nBackground if you've got to walk those because the thing is border security should not be a partisan issue it shouldn't be whether you want to call by person or non part right if not I mean that's how the military that's why I Love the military was it wasn't a partisan place in and despite working for four presidents I deployed under three of them\nTo Democrat one Republican I always want you to do jobs the best of your ability accomplish the mission there is no partisans in a foxhole there's no Parsons down there I ... we just you know can you count on the people that you're down there with solar shoulder to get the job done\nAnd people I Would encourage everyone to go do it because\nIt gives you a perspective and it gives you an insight and the reason is when those drugs are flowing across the border you know those that ... those opioid Oh yes there are killing Democrats or Republicans what their who they're killing our American uh-huh and that's why it is everybody's business and so when you understand the problem\nThen you understand then you it helps you find the solution no it's\nBig I know the agents really appreciate when when people are run for public office and they take the time to go out there and see what we also right we don't have enough of that to be honest I Am thankful that you went out there and that you saw it because now you have you already have that edge because of that\nUm but it helps it it's very very helpful see your doctor or and I knew that so you're a doctor but you're a combat medic riser you all serious serious things out there\nThat's one of the things that inspired me to run I was in Afghanistan and two thousand and I was part of the Obama surge ... got there in June right after General McChrystal took over it was very high op tempo we talked about a lot of that ... and those patrols and convoys there was a lot of\nSort of reminiscent dry on that lonely highway without like driving on those roads in Afghanistan and I tell you what I'm\nYou know when I saw people one of the things that folks don't realize and this is like nothing you would ever get magic could happen\nYou know our soldiers would be putting tourniquets on their arms and legs before we go out on patrol so that if you got blown up in your leg was dramatically amputated you could synch down your own tourniquet to save your own life\nBut when you see people doing that young men and women\nYou realize there's people risk and more than reelection risk and more than reputation and they do it you know and and as you know the camaraderie right being out there are people you know they brushed it off they kind of joke about it laugh about it but you know that is a big deal and they need a voice yes and I said to myself then\nThese folks need a voice because people don't realize that's what's happening\nAnd and so here I Am you know run for Congress to give those folks a voice because we're coming up on our Eighteenth year of war mhm no\nHope you're listening to the for our he's he's like he's running for district nine\nGo up there it's important to go out there and vote twenty five years ... a navy combat medic and in just an all around great guy and we've had this is the second time we've we really hung out a this was a longer time and and it was really ... it's an eye opener to talk to you\nBecause you're so down to earth that guys need to know that I Know there's a lot of former military that work within the agency and hey go up there and back up one of your own you know it's it's a big deal it's a huge deal especially in these midterms you said that it's a real turn out right usually a terms yeah oh we can't have that we\nCan't have it there's too much at stake there is far too much at stake you know our country's future of the direction our country takes\nYou know is is in the balance and we live again this is one of those other things in right you know part of the reason people or whether they're coming across the border or whichever way because America has this opportunity we have democracy right where most of the places when the navy or the marine corps your travel agent roaster\nYeah I can barely I use the F bomb very eloquently I think but then I always get mark on him around mark and I feel I tone it down and he's going to go out and said you said jeeze art that's ... that's what I Do because I Know it's like\nHey you know what I mean you know what I'm saying mark and police work we would call that verbal judo so that's great see that's what I like it so tell us you know he just talked about it because I Know I read your book\nAnd and I said hey this we can plug your book here mark and people will buy it you'll be like in New York bestseller you want to go to work well ... was into like a bird book today but it certainly was a kid knowledge\nThe deep friendship that you know I've had with art and prior to our it would've been a ... random Jed those crazy you know so much older guys the one guy I'd probably\nThe less hair than you do Brandon has lesser than me says 'cause I grew up watching it but you're clearly the best looking I don't know who the smartest is like ... or ... when a ... I worked in Phoenix at my last four years with the financial enforcement association\nI'm we encountered a serious problem well I shouldn't call it a problem I should call it a crime has called illegal immigration [laughter] uh it was a literally killing my members I've had six officers killed by illegal aliens oh it was literally killing\nOur Hispanic community partners in Phoenix right it was clearly a sanctuary city policy we went head to head with chief show this\nAnd got a change so that we could not only partner successfully with federal immigration punishment that we could facilitate their success\nIn forcing while heck we deal with the FBI the da da da da and specter ... U.S Marshals but we weren't allowed to the border patrol or I should call they didn't make sense it was risky it was dangerous and we saw the aftermath of that [noise]\nNo yeah I Know you guys went through some Susan ... times and obviously losing an officer just plain and simple is is a big deal and it's like you know what since since you were a police officer for the longest time you hear that argument though mark you hit the argument that a lot of people make of well we have criminals here what's the difference\nYou know is is is the illegals really that bad because but the way I see it is yeah I Know we have criminals here but we don't need to import more criminals right I mean that's what it comes down to well and that kind of talk\nA lot like it sounds like the concept of an acceptable casualty rate uh-huh well only ... I Can't imagine Steve for are on the battlefield saying well we only had ten killed right no good doctor would be upset if he had one wounded\nA there is no acceptable casualty rates in proactive constitutionally base law enforcement or we leave no man we leave no woman behind him these policies were forcing\nOr actually mandating illegal aliens to commit another crime created another victim and cause more damage first before we could partner and proactively interact with border patrol and I\nKnow and I know you you've been very active for quite some time no just not as a police officer would you be a very active in ... I I guess I call it the movement of making sure that a police officers are taken\nI don't want to be serious 'cause I think they're taking serious but they're not taken for granted I guess is the word that I'd be looking for um you were very instrumental in helping the national book will come so with a lot of the\nIssues that we've had an endorsement you've been very instrumental you I mean you helped us form a great partnership with share of George pile\nUm who thinks because if you you've got an us in their front door many times um and and there's just a lot of things that you've done I Want to ask you this though it's when you're twenty five years of of being\nA police officer you're very uh\nClint Eastwood dish [laughter] club dirty Harry you know a young ladies would of course not rowdy gates from raw but you know\nThere are worries me I look old like an eighty two year old ... [laughter]\nI don't want your five bucks a late is that you know nice where did I Know you're with Joe clear you know and he's been on the show a couple of times\nAnd he talked about the times you know his him being a security guard at the metro mall he was really and he got fired did he got fired for because if you're an idiot [laughter] yeah but in all your years did you ever tell one of the ...\nGo ahead make my day\nAbsolutely no no no I I Would advise him frequently have this thing called Miranda and how much of a wonderful time they would have in Sheriff Joe jail a there you go back that no that's that's awesome\nSo twenty five years sure story mark the listeners when I hear a story you know we have a lot of law enforcement to listen to have a lot of uh civilians and I'll listen to it\nUm I Know you've been we've been together at a lot of these oh I don't know events where there's a lot of protesters and the people that protest against law enforcement you senior share of protests\nAgainst law enforcement and I've seen my\nMy share of a lot of bad things involving law enforcement I'm clearly I'm\nBiased towards law enforcement in the sense that I greatly admire uh men and women who choose to run into a gunfight a it's a great honor to serve those who served to to help those who helped protect those\nWho protected that they would interest me with caring for them was great honor a and and their success clearly him positively impacted the success of the community and when it's been\nWhat has been delightful for me as the transition from the camaraderie and the partnership\nOr in friendship from law enforcement and Phoenix\nTo federal immigration enforcement ... with the border patrol it's been very natural made a lot of sense for me so the ability to serve you guys and your membership\nOr not only you know political into professional capacity certainly for my position and judicial watch Rahm but also from a from a spiritual capacity in the sense of providing some a Judeo Christian ethic some principals to encourage a to stay the course or because you know we always used to joke about\nEverybody loves a firefighter\nOr nobody loves the cop when I finally got her and her house it's a great thing about when the cop knocks on your door so he's going to go to jail ... they're always behind the curve um\nThe men and women that I work with as well with you we never start to fight\nBut we always have to finish it\nAnd if we don't finish it correctly we're going to go home hurt or dead right and if we don't finish it legally we're going to go home indicted so there's a huge burden we don't start it but we finish it but yet we're a hundred percent responsible for the outcome is a huge burden I admire anyone who gets paid\nThe pittance that local law enforcement of federal law enforcement gets paid for that huge ... New York I see you guys get paid a lot anyway\nYou hear it on time limitation if you want to get rich you don't want to law enforcement [laughter] ah that's not where the money that\nRight and and I'm going to switch gears and they may make some people uncomfortable and just giving me a weirdo\nI'm ... I'm actually listening intently so it was fascinating yeah because I I\nMike what my question sort of like what is the biggest hassle for law enforcement dealing with the illegal immigration situation with our hands tied are they able to do their job that's something I definitely want to know about\n... percent tuition I tell you that the biggest hassle for law enforcement\nLaw enforcement whether it's federal or state or city\nThese men and women have a lot of pressure mhm I'll tell you something right now yeah Ninety five percent of the pressure from police were called is used that term for me right doesn't come from the bad guy in front of me comes from that manager behind me was going to second guess me six months eight months of twelve months down the\nLine [noise] five percent of the pressure comes from the bad guy but I can empathize and even sympathize with the bad guy I Know what he's going to do I know why he's doing and I'm trained to handle that\nBut when the manager and I'm sure you see this to art in your shop for national border patrol council\nHas all this time ah to second guess\nYou Steve decisions life and death decisions and the wind whether it's in the city of Phoenix or in Dallas where the shooter don't shoot rats don't arrest search don't search uh the biggest risk the manager has he might get a paper cuts and have his feelings hurt\nBy my guys are getting shot at you guys getting shot at and rocks that is that's the pressure or no to the ... tale that when it comes to immigration issues\nIt makes absolutely no sense\nThe agenda with open borders that impacts Phoenix police officers and certainly with border patrol in ice guys and gals is this pursuit of power and profit yeah the last one power\nThe right wants profit and the way you get power and profit is by taking advantage of all people group on that board and you saddle them with crime and you've settled them with the menial in the ...\nDana patched and it's just absolutely brutal\nAnd disgraceful that people would take advantage of people group ah\nIn in encouraging motivate others to break the law right that that's just shameful and once again it spills over not only into communities but into two professional careers and also victims and suspects like there's a huge cost you ... you know what's\nAmazing is that you're right you hit the nail on the head there's a lot of managers that they've forgotten where they came from you know I I reading through my notes obviously we have issues here you guys have had the issue is what do you think it is that makes these managers forget we call it drink the Kool Aid sometimes but it's amazing you know we have different things at", "city": "Tucson", "locations": [["Scottsdale Arizona", 33.50921, -111.89903], ["S.

years later she ended up asking me to be so yeah they grow up and they get to a certain point did you approve or it was pretty funny no hell no [laughter]\n\nThat's fantastic fantastic [laughter] love that\nHey we're going to take a real quick break folks we're gonna come back with a President Trump's talk on condemning some Democrats on uh the way they're acting towards\n... ice and the way they're acting towards law enforcement in general uh I'm hoping to get\nTo a later on in the show on the more apprehensions that we're seeing and obviously the crisis that the human screw up the human scrub there's the human smugglers are creating in Arizona and ah you'll be interesting to hear that there's some managers especially at the Tucson station\nThat are not a really helping with this crisis and uh they're just they're taking advantage\nOf some border patrol agents and I wanted to talk about that because as always enjoy exposing bully and I think that's the mentality that is going on at the Tucson station particular anything going a little bit she\nMen and women who carry their gear Gerber is unstoppable decades of innovation and dedication and put them on Tom Green out as a master of knives and tools reverse problem solving lifesaving products are designed whether you need to have a specific activities in mind today that includes much more than a blade it is a lifestyle\nWhen law enforcement and tactical professionals need quality products they go five eleven tactical five eleven tactical as are the loyalty and trust of those protecting humidity and families worldwide we're proud to have five eleven is our sponsor Ross promote their products because saver and our second and so forth [noise] hey\nTo the Greenland folk prejudice trust 'cause damned some Democrats\nAnd their attempts to a sort of police from cooperating with ice and in stemming tide of these lethal drugs\nAnd I think it's important for people to understand because we have way too many people are dead or running for political positions that are anti law enforcement and it's it's scary\nWhen you start looking at and at the same time I think you have individuals that are already in political positions that don't understand what it is that we do so what they're doing is\nThey're trying to make us the villains that way they can pull the votes from a certain group of people right when it comes down to a like these antifa jerks that you see all the time um which I've seen some of these on these guys\nAre probably get the one big yoked anti forgot to come after me but it is what it is I just tell you that I see some of these antifa folks and uh some of these and our so called anarchists and\nI don't know Andy I don't think they could fight their way out of a paper bag right you know they're pretty weak looking individuals' a but apparently they think they can be tough guys and they're out there talking about it and one thing that I wanted to talk when we get to President Trump's remarks right\nBut one thing I Want to talk about as there was um some antifa folks\nOn September twenty first his window for the media first reported it right and uh it was a website it was in it and ... a website and it did\nCall for the slaughter of it this is what it says the call it's a call for the slaughter of fastest border patrol dogs and their boss wow\nAnd that's in reference to uh to publish claims that are known by a tea for activists so it goes on and it shows and it says um killers and brown sugar uniforms which we don't wear brown so they already there colorblind\nHow the United states border patrol brutalizes the masses and uh it was written on the September twentieth of twenty team and then they're well known anti fur activists it's the the writers and the new service and uh I think his name is Rick Salazar\nAnd they called themselves revolutionaries and it's time to rise up with the masses right and and cause violence against fastest\nBorder patrol dogs and their boss says he goes on to say slaying them slaying them that's what it says ... laying them with revolutionary fire and justice\nThe source also stated that they said a red guards and their supporters\nAs they have said just before the time for activism is over now is the time for a war believe that\nSo they're calling out for an all out war on\nAgainst border patrol agents directly it's a little right on the source also advocated too and ah the barbarism that the U.S imperialism and for masses from Central America and Mexico\nTo exact rubble luge revolutionary vengeance and seize power\nSo I don't think that has done it enough media play\nAnd I don't think people know what antifa how the the ... started where it started I don't think people really know about it just is you hear it once in a while and that's it yeah they're bugs\nIs what they are then you'd be squashed and I know it sounds horrible to say it and then they'll say oh well arts law enforcement and he'd say you know what guys these people are domestic terrorism there are a threat to America there are a threat to our way of life and I took an oath to defend this country against all terrorists foreign\nAnd domestic and that's where people were getting lost and these people were domestic terrorists but to go ahead and say it's time to stop activism it's time to start the war it's time to go on an all out war\nHey listen man at the end of the day I just want to live to be an old man and if some of these anti for guys come and there was a problem and I got to take a few of them with me so be it\nShould agents keep their eyes open ... or even more now I've always I mean it's like they have always\nI think all on force meant when the time we're all on force but needs to keep their eyes open and you have these certain regimes and you have these these actors so called activists and you have these throughout the entire border though the um the hubs across the border people as I like to call them you know and and\nThey're anti law enforced that's when it comes down to and they say well\nYou know the people that you guys were wrestling are not criminals if I break into your house in my criminal\nIf I just go into your window at my luminal yeah you know I'm a criminal you know if I Need something I'm going to go in there just to take it 'cause I'm In need store criminal you know regardless of if I'm Broken into your house before are not at all it takes is one time and I'm a criminal so I'm tired of hearing this oh well these these\nIllegal immigrants do not need to go to a concert legal aliens I'm tired of hearing that don't call them aliens for one I'm tired of hearing people\nAttacked that that's the legal word illegal aliens and the reality is\nI don't care if you break into the country once twice or if it's your hundredth time you're breaking our laws of our country and you are a criminal\nYou may not like it you may be bothered by the fact that you're being called the criminal which are criminal\nAnd and and a lot of it stemmed and my my frustration is when I did this Fox a town hall John ... couple of weeks ago yeah there was a girl there and she was very like don't call me a criminal don't call me an alien that's what you are\nAnd then I and I went on her face on our on our Instagram page on her Instagram per person on Instagram page right [noise] and\nOffer pictures are or how Mexico's fantastic how she root for the Mexican team has the Mexican seems so great in fact she has a picture on her um Instagram\nWhere it's her birthday cake right and it's a Mexican flag ... so I'm sitting here going didn't why do you want to be a citizen of this country\nYeah you know what I mean it just doesn't make any sense your allegiance is obviously not here it's over there so go I'm I'm okay with you just\nPractice what you preach yeah right\nUh I got so many things in my head that I Want to talk about\nPresident Trump delivered those ... or some remarks are at the one hundred and twenty fifth annual conference as an exposition of International Association of chiefs of police along the opposite of Florida and yeah that's a long name [laughter] he got a lot of praise though from from a lot of the attendees and um\nHe talked about the brave efforts with federal immigration and Customs Enforcement office the eyes\nHe says\nWho does what does he doesn't do something a particularly as I keep teasing some issues at the Tucson ... [noise] you're listening to the Greek\nTexas federal wellness center founded with a vision based on principles focused on superior healthcare utilizing a combination of physical medicine physical therapy and surgical expertise visit the website at Texas F. W. C. dot com [noise] this is the green line\nAs the vice president of the national border patrol council I represent more than Fifteen thousand border agents we need leaders who will help us fix the border prices just in cinema opposed funding to help law enforcement fights and drug cartels and she supported dangerous sanctuary city policies here say cinema is weak on border security\nThe national border patrol council was proud to endorse Martha ... for Senate and we know Martha has our back and she'll do what it takes to secure the border\nAnd my family and I approve this message and now back to the green [noise]\nBack and they want to talk about prevention\nRio Grande valley sector chief ... says that the numbers have doubled for those crossing the border illegally\nOver for thousands or four thousand arrests were made for the first week of this fiscal year compared to just over two thousand arrest being made on October of twenty Seventeen they've doubled why do you think they've doubled\nBecause catch and release is still going on\nBecause there's no consequences for the individuals that are breaking our immigration laws\nBecause the rhetoric alone that President Trump delivered when he first took over office dropped the numbers and our leaders within the United states border patrol failed to act upon that window that's when it comes down to why because this is what you have\nYou have an all star team which is the border patrol agents\nThere are all strict then you have the managers and the coaches the general manager all that and then you have the owner which in this case I Will attribute the owner as being President Trump\nSo it works right so we are\nConsidered I Would say under new ownership with all star players that need motivation that need the proper gloves hats\nBalls foot wear uniforms\nNeed all that the owner wants to give them too\nBut the general manager who's been a general manager for quite some time uh is a feeding different information probably to the owner then you've got the coaches and the manager\nWho are are the same coaches and managers that were there before they just change their position one turned into another manager and the other one is now the batting coach and just flip flopped\n[noise] so where is the problem in the managerial staff that all star players I just said the all star players were the ones that were in line wanting this new owner and they're happy with the new owner President Trump the issue has always been\nThe general manager and the and the manager of the coaches of the team [noise] we're not going to change the game plan if you have the same manager in the same no matter no I'm not saying fire or higher position leaders\nBut give them another position somewhere else I don't know that's all I'm saying I think we have good leaders within border patrol I think a lot of them are going to be retiring here soon because it's their time to retire then they're done and they don't see any change it I see it all the time with some of the leadership I speak to\n'em it's going to be a scary next few years because we have\nI don't know less than responsible or less than professional leaders that are going to be staying and they're going to be getting higher positions now and then you shouldn't have the higher ups which are running the organization that are still running it and they're doing a horrible job\n[noise] so that's my rent on that because I think it's important that the\nThe regular citizen understand I'm not trying to attack because there are certain things I Want to hold back on not because I'm scared to say it but because I don't want the general public to think here's art just ranting and raving attacking his agency I'm not attacking my agency we have\nAnd tested agents rank we have fantastic leaders unfortunately many of the managers that are in this agency that are calling the shots and the bigger wig people are in DC that are causing shots are doing a horrible job\nAt the expect the expense of the agents and at the expense of um some of the leaders that actually want to be leaders it's just the way it is yeah\nYou're seeing this crisis you're seeing the amount of individuals are coming into that states you're seeing it here in Arizona as I said more than fourteen hundred Central American illegals primarily from Guatemala have been found traveling in large group since August in remote areas in different parts of the desert in Arizona\nI've been surprised to see the number of groups you don't have it you'd think two three four maybe ... people to the hundreds ... amazing hundred people because there's no consequences any there's all kinds of us are getting cut costs are getting released so for listeners who don't know what catch and release is and I know we've explained to her\nBut ages catch him they fingerprint um they don't have any prior criminal history the United states keep in mind I don't have the database of their country so I don't know if they committed crimes and their country\nRight um there's nowhere to house them\nSo you release them you're making pinkie swear that they're short for an immigration court that's it based on a on a ... I mean there's more to the process obviously our paper was but that's in it then\nAnd then that show that's what it is\nNo consequences or you know they were talk we were talking about the crisis the Arizona issue\nThe agency it did cite that at least eight years instances since August twentieth in\nWhich a group more than a hundred undocumented aliens usually including families and small children were found in areas of south west Arizona now I talked a somebody sent me a message I don't even know what was it I get I get messages all the time and anonymous people and there was a big group that they arrested and are they all had the same phone\nNumber in their pocket right and so this I guess this guy is an uncle to over a hundred individuals but they answered head you know so and so you're the uncle yeah I Am just what\nCatch and release it's obvious there's the smuggling organization is just ridiculous and they're laughing at our laws I mean that's what upsets the heck out of me you know um\nYou see the amount of illegals that are coming through you see them you know turning themselves in large groups you know ... huge groups that are coming through there and they're coming through Yuma\nThey're coming through 'em or ... or ... grand valley there everywhere you know a chief or Anthony provides Nick ... did say this is a humanitarian crisis that is impacting border security\nWhere the judges were the immigration judges and you know why aren't\nThey at the border we there's a you go to the Tucson sector and there's a sign parking and one of the spots is assigned for the immigration judge right there's no one ever partner oh\nYou can't even find parking at Tucson station but yet the judge has a parking spot and he's never been there which is crazy it just said you know what I mean it's just I don't understand how this thing gets run 'em\nAnd so this is affecting a lot of the agents [noise] I see this too yeah and I'll tell you where where this is where it there's a twist\nYou heard me say there's managers that aren't really leaders and that's just I guess it's everywhere but\nI Need to find out I don't want to drop his name yet until I'm One hundred percent sure it did happen right\nBut we had a leader ... to ... well we had a manager at the at the Tucson station right debt ordered an agent to go to handle a case which you can do that's why I'm not saying that's part of our job right and managers yeah give you cases\n[noise] knowing full well that the case was going to go past his regular hours I think it was like half an hour before the end of the shift right\nWe're twenty four hour operation\nSo he orders is individual to go do it now this individual is kind of work Twenty years in the patrol she she is a fantastic agent right she's done a lot of horse patrol prosecutions you name it she's done it so this manager\nOrders her to go take the case she does it because you know this is what it is there's some history back there behind them to [noise]\nAnd there's certainly history and drink with his manager right [noise] so she's handling the case it's it's it's goes into after her ten hours of work right um there's some agents that are finishing off their own paperwork their time and they tend to cheat and stuff that they're regular redo\nSo this managers upset any any any he's got a couple guys would bull's eyes on him that he wants to attack because there's\nThe guy's power hungry that is what is the guy's a power hungry one of these power hungry managers that you know he he he probably can't run anything you know on his personal life so now he decides to be a bully with agents", "station": "KNST", "city": "Tucson", "locations": [["Oregon", 44.00013, -120.50139], ["Fayetteville", 36.06258, -94.15743],
