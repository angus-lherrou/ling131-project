charges thrown out on that\nThink we all have mixed feelings about that I've been feeling Getty was you know happiness\nWe are not going to jail and quite frankly that I'm off bail and may have the opportunity to do civil disobedience again because I had to be very careful while out on bail because if I got arrested it could be revoked and I could spend all of my time in the Clearwater county

to testify for us like Dr James Hansen you know former climate scientists from Nassau\nAnd Bill McKibben so it's a mixed bag Emily\nYeah I I'll go being stronger about it than that and say that you know I was really heartbroken not so much by the acquittal of course which is a good thing it was to sort of second best scenario we could have had\nBut by the denial of our expert witness testimony

in front of those jurors and that might make set a precedent that would really have an impact nationally on the climate change debate seemed like a really important thing to me and of course until four days before trial began it looked very much like it was going to happen\nSo you know it's it's a real shame that that it did not\nKnow as I understand that you heard a booth charged to let you use the necessity defense\nYes and he had granted that to us back in October of twenty Seventeen and in fact he had copies of our expert witness list for for about the last year and a half\nSo at any point in that time period he could have constrained us constrain the number of witnesses said you can't talk about this or that\nAnd he chose not to so the fact that he did that for days before trial began with stunning at the lawyers who couldn't have been more surprised we couldn't have been more surprised until that moment he'd been very very reasonable and it seemed like all systems were go and to be clear the thing about that that was so striking apart from its sudden his\nWas the fact that normally speaking defendants do not have any burden of proof it's it's the prosecution that has a burden of proof normally\nBut because we were going to use a necessity defense and say that what we did\nYou know was essentially a necessary under these circumstances that we find ourselves in to prevent the greater harm of climate change we did have the burden of proof and all of a sudden he knocked out our ability to defend ourselves essentially because who is going to listen to a poet a retired lawyer and a software engineer from Seattle\nOn climate change you know we're not scientists we have no authority so no matter\nHow articulate we had been it wouldn't have had anything like

I understand that there was a system of booties there to warn people about Saddam is what happened to them\nThat's one of the painful parts of this project um Indonesia\nSupported by the U.S in

negative impact on the growth of clams crustaceans shells and bleachers out spawning grounds and coral reefs and so forth around the world\nAre we don't know all the impacts we know it has an impact we don't know the rate of impacts we don't know where you could have a precipitous catastrophic impact and so that's why we all at particular respect and concern\nThe second grade impact is pollution general pollution\nPeople build the building near the ocean there is what we call non source point pollution\nYou I've run off the of gasoline runoff from stations you have oil run off you have pesticide runoff you have high nitrate runoff which affects the level of oxygen and water and therefore the fish and plants and fauna and the ocean\nAnd we have five hundred dead zones around the world and the ocean's today dead zones nothing grows because of what has happened with this overload\nAnd also pollution generally it affects the fish you have plastic getting in the marine mammals are into birds I seen film of a shark send or purposes end or whales dragging net surrounding dragging plastic around it's crazy\nAnd then finally we have over fishing\nWe have too much money chasing too few fish\nAnd that's one of the reasons we don't make cod anymore here\nEight of the top fisheries of the world are now over fished out of this sort of Eighteen or so fisheries principal ones",

United States\nIt pass through quickly though and dropped less rain than other recent major hurricane such as Laurence Harvey Irma and Maria [noise] only the Labor Day hurricane of Nineteen thirty five and hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine had lower barometric pressure is a key measure of hurricane strength\nAnd even some storm experts were surprised by how hurricane Michael intensified

Mann is a climate expert at Penn State University Welcome back living on earth Michael\nThank Steve it's good to be with you so why did hurricane Michael intensify so quickly\nSo it encountered warm a sea surface temperatures I'm In the low eighties in the region where it intensified and it became a major hurricane those temperatures are between two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures\nWhy is that why was the water so warm there there's just a fluke or are we looking at a trend\nSo there's been a degree Celsius of warming globally the oceans of warmed up and it's an ocean heat waves and the notion heat wave just like a normal heat wave is made much more likely with even a modest warming the planet\nNow hurricane Michael brought some pretty intense storm surges eight twelve seed and some of the coastal areas there how much the sea level rise factor into storm surge these days well\nYou know sea level rise depending on where you are in the Gulf Coast or the

today she joins us now welcome back to living on her\nHi thanks for having me\nBarbara Kingsolver this is your first novel and what six years so what brought you the idea of writing what became on sheltered now\nIt's one of those books that took a while to cook I spent several years thinking about\nHow to write about paradigm shift that's what I think\nWe're doing right now I think we're in the moment when so many things that we've always believed in as truth unquestionable are suddenly starting\nTo feel not true anymore it's a moment that feels like crisis like the end of the world as we know it and when I say permanent truth things like\nWell like there will always be a job at the end of the college degree or tenure at the end of the track or or a a pension at the end of a career or good health care or even things like\nIce on the polls that will stay frozen or that there will always be more fish and the sea we're reaching a moment in history when\nAll those shelters are failing us\nSo your device if I can use that word of course is to have to families yeah living more than a century apart yeah in the same house\nRight and of course it's falling down\nLiterally it's literally falling down and that's another\nThing that is in question these days where is it safe to live you know the occasional hurricane or maybe there's going to be a a a huge forest fire or or whatever in fact you yourself you move from the southwest back to Virginia because you could see that there ain't going to be too much water there and ...\nExactly that it was already functioning kind of like a spaceship that everything people use their and needed to be brought in from the outside and in fact we are\nBeing on a spaceship and we've been\nLiving on it for so long well I mean not in terms of\nYou know human evolution but in terms of presidents civilization we've been just operating on the presumption that our culture and our economy can grow infinitely just the presumption of infinite growth um\nHas to somewhere and\nWe just keep throwing more more of the same old request that the world of give me more give me more or less grow more or less um growth and consumption\nAre are the answer a seem to be the answer to our prayers so what happens when it seems like you're praying the wrong prayer\nSo if I were to go through the various issues that are confronting people to the side from\nThe fact that it does seem kind of falling apart just sort of randomly you address parenting romance among grown ups women and science of evolution climate feral cats bought me fresh local food

naturalist who is that the next door neighbor who becomes a kind of a larger than life figure she was real she's a real person who I found it fascinating to research she really was the lightning rod for this novel\nBut it took me to find land\nI as I said I was thinking for a couple of years about how to get into this big question about how people behave in times of crisis and I had chosen\nI
