warehouse where these young people might work one day [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou remember Patterson, California has all of these warehouses over by the highway and it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses is Amazon's\nEvery shot to them to see if I can come take a\nCorrect and\nAnd visiting the facility\nGave me a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the Congress corrupt especially when it comes to increased automation [noise]\nI entered the building bears justice to wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway and there are signs everywhere that say no photo\nOnce a guard like me and I realized the springtime tons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners bad\nJust under ... million for me [noise]\nUh we also in way more than a hundred full time with it [noise]\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to for you to introduce herself as a community specialist I'm not sure what that means in fact there's a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associates\nEntry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase fulfilling our customer promise ...\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground\nLike wrote which is good because\nI'm going to\nThat actually though ... says\nWe will see another one in a minute we call them Avi A.\nG. these automatic guided vehicles\nBasically it's like a forklift loaded up with them but it's totally unmanned and it follows a map of the warehouse score programmed into it\nIt just wishes bias no problem\nEverything\nIn this warehouse is yellow and gray\nFor another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots as an ally but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLent chewed up communications for Amazon they're\nPerson shaped robots more like big orange room but they're square and on top of each of them is a set of shelf which holds item\nOperate in this\nSo this is how it works say somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it on line once they do that that's when the item gets ...\nNotice on the screen provided the item I just said I Am [noise]\nAnd then one idiom how many they need to\nPick back massager\nSecond worker calls the orange robots over retrieved massager from the shelf and then puts it on the yellow track\nKind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor belt\nThat an acceptable process in place that we're going to go and\nStation it's what it sounds like basically the back massager comes in on the yellow tray and the worker accepted into box no robots here\nThis is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy actually if I can tell us\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo of stuff she's seen someone order\nI asked her how many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know an hour they want us to do about Greece so\nYou could do that we were ... hours a day workers\nNormally do for ... so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week\nThe very last thing that happens here back massager is that it gets a shipping lately all of the labor at this point is done by a magical\nPuff of air\nA shipping label is created and generally play it live up to err on top of the\nSound you hear them talk on the air that is placing it on to the shipping this hard I have to admit it's literally my favorite [noise]\nSo the robot for Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I find that my mother's room and there are vending machine\nThat I see two they're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly\nWage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands of Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says these figures are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nSo right after the incident we reached out to an ... cheetah she's a Colombian immigrants who runs a national nonprofit organization called the center for popular democracy and in our conversation we learned that a ... he had she had actually been preparing for that moment for most of her life\nI on ... welcome to let us say thank you so much\nSo I'm September twenty eighth you made a road of the line actually who to target Senator Flake and as a result of that you made a a narrative road that nobody could have imagined\nSo the story of friday begins many months ago the Trump election I think just created a sense of kind of unveiling of\nThe ugly underbelly of the country my organization the center for popular democracy which is a network of community organizations had been training people across the country for months and these tactics that we called bird doggy burn docking burn jogging\n[noise]\nWhat it's [laughter] bird dog and pony is the name of the ... topic where did you just for its human interaction with an elected official [noise]\nYou just show up at their offices and you say hey I'm here I Want to talk to you right now I Know you're there\nLet me tell you my story right now and you learned how to do this somebody a colleague of mine Jennifer ... she's the one who taught me about or jogging and she went across the country training people she sent emails to her friends and said\nYou can put Fifteen people in a room I Will come to you and train you on bird talking tactics and civil disobedience\nDo you remember the the thing that you remember the most that impacted you when you first experienced burn dogging\nA colleague of his name is Eddie bark and he was diagnosed with Alice and he went to D.C for the first time to fight the tax bill to tell his story when I was flying back home to Santa Barbara where he lived he bumped into Senator Jeff flake on a plane\nAnd the bird dog Senator Flake in that point\nFor water for one of our ... was\nHer her farm and for her and\nTold him that Senator Flake I Am dying of al is if you vote for the tax bill you will take away my disability payments you will take away my health care and I will not be able to be around for my son to grow up\nI Need you to be a hero in that\nMoment that interaction went viral\nEx gas made headlines when he can front of the Republican senator on an airplane about the upcoming vote on the latest version of his Republican tax bill\nAnd thousands of people than began to follow IDs debt and come to Washington DC to fight to tax\nWithout giving break there have been more than ... demonstrations already targeting Republican lawmakers\nMany of those people came back to join the members of United we dream to fight for\nThat and also known as dreamers protestors from the ceiling Shannon across Pennsylvania street linking arms out fine Senator Joe Donnelly the office like you see\nMany of them came back to join the women's march\nOrganizers were just hoping to get about two hundred thousand but you've got more than two hundred thousand\nTo fight against the separation of children at the border and many of these folks have been in Washington DC the last several weeks bird dog and members of Congress following their senators to try to force him person interactions with them and to tell them their stories\nAnd so that's how I ended up in D.C these week and I'm sure that there are people are saying I'm hearing burned out again and I'm feeling uncomfortable is it about confronting jumping taking on being confrontational\nNo it's not it's not about being confrontational it's about seeking connection it's about allowing elected officials to remember who they represent to connect their humanity to your humanity\n\nI was asking myself that question of whether I Want it to tell my story or not and in that moment I just went with it\nAnd he said you know I I was five he was Fifteen\nAnd I shared at that time when I was five with two adults not my parents who either didn't believe me or didn't know what to do with that information they never did anything so they just understood the lesson that we are not believed and these boy understood the lesson that\nBoys will be boys\nAnd I don't want my children to learn that lesson\n\nI Want to believe that in our country we actually listen to survivors and it was a very painful moment I cried after because I realized\nOh my God maybe my father will hear it this way maybe my mother would hear these way [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nIt didn't reach them but then on friday I texted made that\nInteraction with flake and they said you might hear something and then use I Want you to know that I Am okay and he said I'm Sorry I was not able to protect you and he said to him it was not your fault and it's not my fault and they feel very supported by you but you know that fear was confirmed\nI didn't tell my story because I didn't want him and other people who love me to\nHave to hold that pain\nAnd I'm not doing it alone like I'm doing it with all these women I I feel so much in community with thousands of women I have never met but whose stories I deeply deeply understand\nWhen you see what happened in the moment with Senator Flake how do you connect that to the kind of activism that you've been doing and developing on immigration how do those two worlds come together in that moment for you\nA lot of the conversation about a survivors has centered or the stories of women kind of without talking about the rest of their experience of who we are I Can't separate\nMe being a woman from being let me now from being an immigrant from being a mother and now\nAccepting and embracing these other part of my identity as a survivor I think the history of these countries the history of\nThe struggle for inclusion of morals us and the promise of freedom\nIn some ways the the act\nOf bird dog named Senator Flake people will say it is your most overt political act\nIn some deeply human ways it's the least political act\nYeah I think it was the mother and me honestly that came out there is a quote by a seat activist Valerie ... so the mother and meet asks why didn't\nLet him leave darkness is not the darkness of the two of them but the darkness of the ...\nWedding America is not dead but a country waiting to be bar what does the midwife say she says when we are in labor cheeses breeze\nAnd then Bush because if we don't breeze we'd die if we don't Bush we die if we don't push him make that day but if we push with our labor and I love and our vision we\nWill bring his country into

of Congress and the sound of a male female making [noise]\nI've been positive in that like the nicks people mhm because of our own kind of history in this country that we're going to be bringing a different kind of politics yeah that's right and I'm just wondering where like you know what you think about\nUm [noise] that notion [noise] to be\nPhoenix or to be like the\n... year our identity [noise] is the most I Would say is the most intersection identity in the world so for example I'm Puerto Rican that means that I Know that I Am African [noise] I Am indigenous\nI Am also a product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ... and to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to champion the causes of everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration for example\nThese aren't just quote unquote\nMexicans coming in from the border these are these are indigenous people [noise]\nAnd this is their land where your mom and\nDad [noise] speaking to you and saying that looks on their meter ... he was proud of being a war was a message like look on Sunday or you're in New York or through and through however you want to define yourself\nYou know I was I grew up with a very strong sense of patriotism a very strong sense of who we are American I also was raised as you are ... like through and through and\nSo I grew up like the music I grew up around was Hector level ... cruise and then hip hop in you know growing up around the\nBrand your favorite hip hop artist would be a boy\nSo hard I grew up around my public enemy and not as Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like your fat ... a big ...\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so it's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes\nPeople say like oh wow you're\nThe way you articulate your platform is do intersection off and to me it's not even that we're trying it's this is who we are and so what what it means to be American and what we grew up and like how we grew up around these values was my dad\nWill go visit family and what do they go every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah do you mean like for the weekend all I mean we would take a little family vacation and it'll be like ... and you were young yeah those are like a two places where we went on family ... she cried\n[laughter] it was colonial Williamsburg I'm going to see all that [laughter]\nHow do you manage that as being a young enough you know a lot of people don't know if they you know start like you're walking around member of Congress drink me with you know I'm an at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress I think I'm Still\nProcessing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous or just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been at the process\nBut I had a friend come over a couple of months ago\nAnd there was a magazine that had my face on the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of political ideas of twenty teens\nAnd she looked at it and we were laughing at it because it doesn't feel like this isn't my ... lives in Ireland\nBut we're laughing at it and she says that's what you are you're in idea now\nAnd I felt like\nI had to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nThat may be resist or an interesting question how are you managing your ego [noise] 'cause I mean the truth is is that you're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games that it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and\nAll of that but at the same time it's also lonely [noise]\nIt is and if anything the there are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary\nIn my brain and in my heart I feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of the six dreams of terrifying I feel like I have this huge target because I'm embodying some of the most vulnerable people in society\nTo be pleasing and nice and sweet and polite and all of that and I'm not always that way you know and why aren't we allowed to be angry and to be fun to be a human being and it's just\nIt's frustrating and ... for trade a docile and fly it and yeah and who is not that way um she pushes against everybody she doesn't like anyone telling her what to do [noise]\nThis book when you were trying to get it published\nIt was rejected buying some agents because uh because what they didn't like the tone of the main characters\nI didn't like her voice and I said to myself well that's the most\nPart so I'm not saying you know and I took that as you know we were telling me that they didn't like the fact that this was a complicated strong Latina character I remember one rejection\nReally was upsetting for me and I cried because it was really mean spirited\nAnd I just really upset I felt really discourage but again I felt like I didn't need to change the voice because I felt like that that's what made it special\nAnd so I just held out until I found someone who believed it and finally I did find an amazing agent who's been wonderful to me it all worked out so\nI think that's just a lesson for young women to just kind of stick to your guns and if you believe in something someone else was going to believe in it to\nA year has passed since the publication of their book and I'm a follower of years on Instagram and so I was watching as like you know suddenly Erica Sanchez the poet has a novel and it's like constant smiles and you're getting recognition and it's just like\nOh yeah definitely two thousand and Seventeen was just wonderful like so many amazing things happened I was on the New York times list et cetera and it was just a magical time [noise]\nTwo dogs any team came around and [noise]\nEverything seemed to fall apart for me\nA really really tough depression started early in the year and it lasted about six months [noise]\nThe most challenging time with my entire life\nAnd so how all these like wonderful things happen and all of a sudden [noise]\nI don't know everything just kind of\nAnd then all of a sudden you actually put on your Instagram ... tell us what\nI wanted to be open about my struggle\nIt appears as if everything is magical for me\nUm but that's not really the keys you know even though I Am incredibly successful unlike very grateful for that I still struggle with mental illness like success doesn't cure depression and so I went through this really dark time and I just wanted people to know that\nThis happens and um that it's OK to ask for help and that it's okay if you're not okay and so yeah I Know a lot of really beautiful responses to that I think people really appreciate vulnerability and I also talked about my recovery because I wanted people to know that it's possible\nTo to overcome issues like this it's it's possible to I don't think ... beat depression necessarily but to to live with it and to address it so\nWhat are you trying to tell the young at well anyone who reads the book\nBut especially young Latinas\nYou know if you're looking at them straight in the eye if you're looking at a young Latino was dealing with these feelings of like am I good enough I'm not a good Mexican I'm such an American girl like I'm so confused I hate my life\nWhat do you say to them I Want to know that I see them that I get it you know I Want them to fuel understood\nAnd that's what I Want and when I was growing up I didn't really have a lot of literature that spoke to me in that way and you know I had a son that season it was and I adored her but like that was it didn't have anything else and I wanted to write a book in which young women of color could see themselves and they could understand that it's a\nKey to be depressed that it's something that\nIs normal um also that it's okay to be flawed you know because we don't really see characters like that very much [noise]\nI think we're expected to be like I like the title says we're expect to be perfect\nBoth in\nSociety and was in her family is and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know that\nI Know that they exist [noise]\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are [noise]\nThank you for putting it into words Erica Sanchez we really really appreciate your work thank you so much I really appreciate your interview [noise]\nErica ... Sanchez is the author of the New York times best selling novel I Am not your perfect Mexican daughter [noise]\nComing up on like you know you I said did you know the Dominican women graduate from college and higher rates than any other Latino demographic in New York City it's all about the data out data points can help us understand the future of young Latinos in New York and beyond stay with us today yes [noise]\n\nIf the time of year to think about the tax benefits of donating your used car trailer or even motorcycle to Ninety point one learn more by colleague one eight six six nine zero one W.

argue and the next presidential election Texas will be a toss up state [noise] and so all this brings us to one of the sheriff's biggest talking points\nTexas is not a red state it's a non voting state\nIf the people would vote we would when\nShe's right about the non voting part the seat has one of the lowest voter participation rates in the country and many of those non voters are Latinos\nTexas has the second largest eligible population of Latino voters nationally you'd only twenty seven percent say they will absolutely vote in the mid term election compared to sixty five percent for non Hispanic whites\nAnd for the sheriff to when she needs to get Latino voters out to the polls especially first time Latino voters and she thinks she can do it\nIf you give them something to vote for something they identify with there's a bitter possible as it they'll come on to her\nAnd she's even going around registering Latino voters\nOne at a time [noise] [noise] right

I mean I think that's kind of our problem is how do we get them to turn now\nAnd I'm really not sure what the answer is or what the ... [noise]\nAnd we're not the only ones who noticed this September Quinnipiac poll has sheriff felt that his favorability rating among young people ten points lower than governor addicts\nYounger voters are important for Democrats to win in any state and one third of eligible Latino voters in Texas are ages Eighteen to twenty nine that's a large portion of Latino voters in a state where the Latino vote these cheat [noise]\nBut here we are out of college where nearly half of the students are Latinos and let the nuts and none of them are at this event\nSo there are a few things that could be contributing to it seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for this particular\nFrom young voters the first problem to share of has his name recognition not enough people know who she is\nAnd part of this is advertising and that comes down to money which the sheriff has a lot less of than her opponent governor Abbott has raised over sixty five million dollars in campaign funds compared to the share it's less than half a million\nOr he is a person that just has a very extreme ideas about the way boating should work who should be able to vote and I realize that the vast majority of his views on voting stem from his views on immigration\nIt's a no brainer if you really want to create jobs for Americans we need to start aggressively invalid racial laws and looking after our own citizens first\n\nSo tell us a little bit about Kris Kobach and his background like where is it that he started getting these hard line views on immigration\nKris Kobach grew up in Topeka he was valedictorian of high school class and\nWent to Harvard and while he was at Harvard she studied under a professor\nWho had a very extreme ideas on democracy I'm going to take a wild guess and say that that professor Samuel Huntington it is Samuel Huntington\nHe thinks that I think he calls it the Latino is Asian of America and he says that that's going to lead to like a downfall of American culture and that person was Chris Cox mentor at Harvard so how does it happen\nWhen you're looking into the background of Kris Kobach that you start making some connections around anti immigrant theoretical issues and Kris Kobach actually making money off of some of the policies that he ends up basically creating supporting\nRight so his first real job with government was after George Will be Bush got elected he joined the department of justice\nAnd so he leaves the deejay and goes to work for a immigration\nGroup called the federation for American immigration reform that would be fair fair which is a very extreme group that advocates for limits on immigration and for radical alterations to refugee policy is among other things maybe it's time to faze down immigration\nAs we can phase Americans\nBack before by origin for American immigration reform\nAnd so he went to work for them as an attorney but he\nLeaves their to become secretary of state for Kansas site during this whole time he is also trying cases across the country for towns shoe one very radical immigration ordinances for their individual town\nElection day was a victory and farmers friends for supporters of ordinance winning I Know a lot of us are responsible tenants US citizenship\nHazel ten Pennsylvania farmers branch taxes Fremont, Nebraska and Sally park Missouri\nToday anyone renting a house or apartment in Fremont must pay five dollars for an occupying the apartments and\nPeople in the country legally can get one people are moving out and packing\nUp and leaving and and uh it's having the desired effect we wanted to have\nUsually the ordinances were already on the books and he helped them refine them and then defend them in court once they were ... we have traced back all of the money that these cities directly paid Kris Kobach as a lawyer has a lawyer so over a decade we know that he made at least eight hundred thousand dollars\n[noise]\nThese are all small towns whose demographics we're shifting and in some cases not even for real like in a valley park Missouri they I think that's been population went from like one to three percent and that was enough to create this anti immigration sentiment\nWhat Kris Kobach dead in the opinion of the local people that we've talked to there who ended up ... paying person to work with capitalize on that existing sentiment\n\nFor example in valley park do not technically was\nChampioned like it like he he technically wanting valley park and it's like very narrow way\nSo lawn mowing parks it's technically on the books but the people who are there have told us one they've never enforce it and two they regret doing it\nAnd so he took that which is not that big of a when I went to farmers branch and went to a couple of other places and said look what I did for valley park I can do that for you too and then he used that when\nTo create confidence in these towns or at least the appearance of confidence and use that to sort of plow forward so we know for example that he went to farmers branch Texas\nAnd said I did this valley park let's keep going there was internal disagreement within the city council about whether they should keep going whether it was worth the money and he said no I can do the same thing for us for valley park and so they press forward ended up spending more than nine million dollars and they are law was entirely struck down\nLike we're not talking about towns the size of Dallas or the size of New York city\nIt's not like they spent nine million dollars and they were like oh wow like they spent nine million dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice on the part of these towns the only person who appears to have really benefited from this is Kris Kobach so if you think now about\nYou know that strategy earlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the larger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump in the White House and directing a kind of particular perspective\nOn policies regarding immigration you know I I think that prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump\nBeing it's hard line on immigration has he has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impactful voice than he otherwise what\nI think that we can learn from what he has told us he believes\nThen [noise] I think that it is a sign that radical elements of our country have sort of taken a much larger role and we can no longer just messed up [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nJust because they do so much for all of your reporting in

for comment on the allegations ended up pro public investigation up we didn't hear back Kobach told ProPublica golden I Believe in the cities and these ordinances and what they're doing and so if there was some way I could help them [noise]\nComing up I let you know\nSay we talked to the creators of the new HBO documentary dissenting\n\n\nArch\nStay with us look him I guess [noise]\nThis is
