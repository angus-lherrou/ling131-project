Elizabeth\nUh but the idea was to always reaffirmed that this is the social order so this is actually a play about a register side this is someone who violates that and what happens to someone and of course of the country as well when someone does that\nAre so or Macbeth is encouraged by the supernatural or to move a little quickly uh toward his intend to destiny and he takes a short cut in whole chaos ensues [laughter]\nNow you have something which I think it is a wonderful um device if you will on your programs on your website\nWith each play with each production you talk about where it registers I'm the bard dominant or or do you say ... or ... ...\nYou know I uh I I Want to say it's probably a a a three or two\nI think so too so what does that mean perhaps for people who've never attended a play by shakes\nMeans it's an easy road or I Would say that it's simple to follow the story that you don't have to know a lot about Scott history to understand what's happening\nThat is reliable or or in this case probably most of the study that in high school [laughter]\nMatt this is the third time he has this protection that um this production with you in the lead in the title role has been staged at the Shakespeare Tavern\nHas your approach to the character evolved I'd have to say that\nAt the third year here or there is an interesting phenomenon where where'd that first year at the gate and you're so imbedded in the homework your your your dissecting the text and wandering around the parking lot until three AM and really soaking it all in and aggressively\nTackling that and at this point after three years so much of it so much of that homework as in the bones\nThat there's this lovely phenomenon where you can go out on stage really feel the energy in the audience on any particular given day\nAnd just experience the world of the play without having to have a very active you know ... percent of the driver's seat of your own mind trying to\nActively participate in make conscious choices it's almost a subconscious experience ah everything kind of lets you just feel that you're feeling and the given moment and and and experience at a very\nVibrant land actively and that's that's fun at least to some unexpected treats\nIt's a joy to watch too I have to say that it\nWill tell us what the choice of that world well\nIt's a very articulate we put descent into madness over a course of\nTwo hours in Fifteen minutes I mean the the the track that Shakespeare lays this person to go through and and then the ... the mental little loop de loops in hopes this it's it's an obstacle course for the soul and to have\nThat dissent 'cause it's in some ways I think a study on evil and what makes a human being become such a monster 'cause there there's a superficial out into the guy the monsters and to have it\nSo many delicious scrounge just words to chart the ... the mental degradation from from this person and being promised of the world\nAnd being promised him more time with the almost ... an impervious to danger and that that and have that in his relationship with his wife and how how that can create such an entity of evil\nI Love your metaphor about on coal course for the fantastic well let's let's talk about how that relationship how would you describe the relationship of Mac bath with lady Mac that well I\nI think in ... as I cast of our company we've we've gotten at a sort of embedded in our thinking that they have one of the best relationships in all of Shakespeare and I I think what Danny and I had a daddy heard the young lady who plays lady might be\nA we we've been able to find how the relationship changes over the course of the show and and how it how almost there's if you pay attention to how they communicate with one another\nHe says a very little to her they don't really have many philosophical debates on the morality of of doing these things it's it's there's a pressure there and\nSeeing how that relationship kind of degrades over the course of the show that can not only contribute to make these mental degradation but also heard descent into madness because I don't want to give her any spoilers or anything of several hundred year old boy but they still turn out very well for her either a\nAnd a ride around that climactic focal point to the end of act to when we have the banquet scene and we've already established that we're supposed to put on a brave face big smiles everybody we're supposed to be entertaining our friends and\nDisguising the bell would have to make our faces wizards of our hearts disguising what they are getting\nThe little bits of almost passive aggressive ah\nThat mental tug of war and how we relate to the world around us and how we\nMental crisis it's been fascinating\nBut they're finding those little moments back and forth about the rich kid the say opens with the ... and then what follows is the lead hacking and slashed shame his weight and making that process the come true\nWhat is the role of the supernatural ...\nWell the the which is ... they're called the weird\nSisters now that W. E. Y. A. R. D. yeah as opposed to weird which is what how it generally gets translated and ultimately it has evolved in our culture to be the arc typical\nWhich is with the pointy hats and and and the cauldron all of that symbolic edgy kind of can trace its DNA back to this play\nA but in the actual play or they go back to North mythology which is a\nA I guess the most terrifying thing ... you know warrior would ever face would be wounded and disabled on the field of battle after his friends have left\nAnd he would be confronted with the scavengers on the field of battle which tended to be known as the weird sisters and they took on a mythological a stance there because they were the people who would terminate the lives of the wounded warriors so that they could pillage the bodies and\nIt's hardly ... why are they women why do I feel like well\nThere is a there is a patriarchy and their ... their and their original sin and all that stuff to get out layers into that and and that is not necessary and actually this play does not exemplify the best of our culture\nAny way shape or form however\nThat's the root of it and also you see it in the Monty Python which is that you know cutting the thread and they tend to be old and haggard it's we know that men play these parts for Shakespeare and\nIn our play we have three women are two of them are actually just three lovely women and they uh uh they play other parts as well they played men parts and they they they and they play the women but there is a a femininity that might not have been in Shakespeare's\nA a a original and they are and there is well you know we kind of camp it up with a cap it up and say it's flashy you know we have elected a tree Shakespeare Hugo pageantry that's the way\nThat we've we have electric lights and our theaters and week course we take the audience with us with that and there's fog affects and we have puppets which uh I had a phenomenal puppeteer for for several years and uh it's um\nIt's it's it's a lot of fun with the witches but what they do is they advance the course of the action by by but might have actually been Macbeth true destiny to became they say hey you're going to be this and then he starts taking shortcuts and that's where it all goes haywire\nIt's unfortunately not surprising to me because these are the people that that white nationalist believe are working hard to undermine our country through bringing immigrants through a hoping to bring more refugees to the country and through trying to empower people of color in the country so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Lights

was really about reducing reducing until we got to the truth of these characters\nUm and the music is interesting because he thinking a musical the old adage is when the emotions become so heightened that's when you have to break into song because spoken word is no longer a\nAdequate um but with Winnie the Pooh it seems when the emotions get heightened he gets still and quiet so [laughter] it would be sort of counterintuitive to have him break into this Broadway song and dance so we wanted the music to have a much more\nContemplative element and I'm dealing Frederick is our music director

doors will yes it is that something you ever could have predicted would happen when he stood out oh\nAbsolutely not and that's one of the things that kept me going at the beginning\nYou know the idea was I'll just do one I'll do one of the crop tunnel it's a great place to start and so I put one door on the crowd tunnel and then thought for sure what was going to happen if you've ever been to the crowd tunnel everything there gets painted over it's constant constant conversation between artists and so I thought here's what's gonna happen I'll put up a door I'll come back the next day it'll be painted over\nNow but he painted over but nothing happened for months I just watched it sit there and then slowly one day I walked up and there were eight tiny cats [laughter] all pointed at the door as though they were waiting for someone to feed them\nOne that is a lot of cats yeah [laughter] it's about enough that there was just one cat\nBut there were eight and they were arranged perfectly in it I mean it boggles my mind and made me really happy and very curious and then I watched for months after that as more and more things appeared and one day a tiny newspaper about the tiny door appeared was a tiny Atlanta Journal constitution and I got\nReally happy and that's when I open the Instagram and that's when I thought well maybe I could do one more mhm you know and now the doors only go where their request it\nIn the past some of the doors have been damaged seemingly on purpose and seemingly in response to a they're openly pro algae GQ imagery um I remember seeing a remember seeing you posting on on ... the one on the crowd total a got 'em\nAt all at some point seen some kind of vandalism\nUm could you talk about the importance of making that sort of personal political statement was with these with these works\nSo as a queer woman it it just was important to me that I stay true to myself and this and the doors are not\nGay doors and they're not straight doors doors for everyone and part of being for every one\nIs that it's going to need to I Need to make it speaks to myself and to the\nPeople around me and for me the door door number two specifically which is on your old forth worth skate park on the outlines of has a rainbow around it and I we did it for pride a few years ago\nAnd then it kind of stuck kind of became the rainbow door and because of that commitment to the rainbow it has been vandalized more than any other door for sure\nYeah I remember\nJust kind of being amazed seeing the something that small could get that big of a reaction mhm somebody\nI'm I'm Amazed also [laughter]\nI mean\nI I'm not sure that there's really a question here but like you how do you how do you process that kind of reaction\nSo it depends on if I feel like it's incidental or purposeful\nIf I feel like someone just had a can of blue paint and they decided to highlight the door and highlight a bunch of stuff I go okay and I go fix it if it's beaten in with Iraq or you know something I keep 'em I keep a lot of\nDoors on reserves in the studio and I go replace them pretty instantly runners are my favorite because runners will send me pictures immediately when something [laughter] um and I and I go fix it and\nSo how process that is one time I was talking to the people who run art on the line and I said how many people are on the line on a
