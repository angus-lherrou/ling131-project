Hope you're feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the president saying his first remark it hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware as a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize so political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe of those that have had been spewing out some of this viral language you know politicians those who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system you know the answer to this\nOr a political leaders they have the microphones and most important political leaders are present it as a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are man governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize yeah with a loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it and they'll go to the polls if necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that tourists began as\nWell uh actually some would say we're hearing the opposite from the president had been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by those marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that Jews are pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches it's hard to hear that let's listen to these marches again in Charlottesville\n\nSounds on the documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly shouting in the synagogue that had to be telling\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are already conscious of the wrong time being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having\nA big responsibility in this because of his views and his political rhetoric we should all work hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to been watching Clinton sharpen a show on TV yesterday\nShocked and I know NBC a discussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's\nBeen showing you the wrong tone has been settings said to myself what about cats\nHeard of that are not super calm and do you wish you didn't have to do this on Facebook Like is it I guess is it even worth it to try to do this on Facebook as their potential for it to get better\n... one of the big criticisms of Facebook is that they haven't shared enough data especially with academic researchers but also to some extent with fact checkers so it's really hard for me to say if things are getting better or worse\nI Can't say that subjectively it does feel like there are fewer outrageous posts being shared as real news on the platform so\nI Am an optimist and I do think that if we have robust fact checking on a platform that the quality of information on that platform will improve\nWhat do you think happens I mean there's one argument that everybody participating in fact checking program is basically just training Facebook's eventual artificial intelligence you know like what happens when Facebook says great thank you we've learned enough about you know how to detect false information and photos and we're just going to bring this into our machine learning\nWell I think that's a great outcome than we can move on to other types of fact checking\nBut overall I feel like this is a problem to be managed rather than solved\nIf you look at history if you look at other technologies such as the printing press there's always been problems with misinformation and the need for people to find ways to mark sources as\nCredible and authoritative so I don't see the problem that's on Facebook is going away it can get better but it's not going to go away\nThat the end you hold an editor at politifact tomorrow we'll talk to the producers of a new documentary called

on this day when many people are morning we thought we'd offer novel about grief that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction\nBut cigarette Nunez is exquisite novel the friend is about suicide and it's also about the writing world with the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together secret newness spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was\nAbout uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise]\nMy experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flattery O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the areas apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve\n[noise] we do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more in it\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that and draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nI Am so glad to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that would happen\nWell when the when the shot started the injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and picked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating ... and then he did more afterwards\nOr as I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside\nDogs' heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have thought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's ... chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog somebody's going to happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life when you're thinking there\nShe has a life outside the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of that was a dog I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody else where the party are near the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle mammoth but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature\nA big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a talking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person who\nIn trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she's trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I I kept thinking I should Google especially Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties and California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic Lee they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nThing that last year was that was one of the largest years for for threats and threats of violence against Jews I think they're almost two thousand incidents and\nIt's unfortunately not surprising to me because\nThese are the people that that white nationalist believe are working hard to undermine our country through bringing in immigrants through a you know hoping to bring more refugees to the country and through trying to empower people of color in the country so they get a lot of the violent backlash and from from these white supremacist idea\n[noise] is this an unnerving time for you anyway\nYeah it's it's a hugely and every time for me and in part because when something\nWhen something like the synagogue shooting happened um I feel a haunted and depressed but I don't feel shocked um you know in order to feel shocked you have to be surprised and unfortunately these kinds of incidents are not surprising to me anymore and in fact it seems like there's a certain kinds of inevitability and that\nIs true in terms of mass shootings in general uh that that this country has not been able to address to solve them but it's also increasingly true in terms of veal acts of hate at you know I don't think that this will be the last one and and I think probably like a lot of us I sort of\nLive live in fear and with a sense of ... um when it's when it's an ex horrible thing like

the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans and best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural areas suburban area in the city not that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states\nBut just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island\nMay have more of an acceptance of the idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so\nThat also has to take into into place too and also school history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we do in response is\nWe were able to create a resource center is who mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the\nState Department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look and see that there are lesson plans out there dedicated to elementary school to middle school into high schools you\nGot that teacher training there and other tools so willing people out here now doubt or the sample like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what like a specific part of a curriculum and then what might one be in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on in the gun in first grade second grade is just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the\nThe structure now for an individual to have that that emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people live with a mental health condition in the U.S a bit less than half\nGet treatment so this is my also funnel people to wield treatment as opposed to education and that you know there's opposition their teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids teachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nThink what we say in response that look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible again we don't want psychology when uh when we don't\nOn teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma\nAnd this unresolved issue with China is looming quite large remember\nTwo hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of Chinese goods we have terrorists in place those terrorists could rise from ten to twenty five percent in January\nAnd we also I hate to say this word because we haven't talked about in a while but we have a lot of uncertainty around Brexit and that has really prevent that a lot of companies for making major commitments till there's more information and these tax\nCuts have piled on the deficit um they're expected to reach a trillion one trillion next year you know Mitch McConnell the Republican leader talked about how the tax you know this a deficit increase was because of huge spending and Medicare and Social Security and saying that they had to be cuts to that to offset the um\nThe the debt others are saying it's a tax cut would expect to be the economic consequences\nWell I mean look I'm not one of these people who I interviewed tons of economists all the times and some of them are people who think that that's the to the worst thing in the world I don't think that death is are the worst thing in the world however it is mildly annoying that you have\nSomeone like McConnell start to blame the social safety net programs for a deficit one corporate tax receipts based on the left deficit numbers corporate tax receipts were down by thirty one percent\nSo yeah there is truth that the bulk of the money that goes out of the budget has to do with the safety net programs but the big change in the deficit\nCame because of corporate tax real quick you'll get twenty seconds can these be rolled back\nUp probably not because you really would need to see a big gains for the Democrats in the Congress and we don't have a a a veto proof majority at this point Congress for the Democrats\nJust us interest is Alison CBS News hosting money thanks as always daycare is here now [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nI wouldn't want to W.

presidency and so we spend a lot of my time a lot on my classroom talking about the importance of state government and all of the things that governments can do and like all the powers of come to the tenth amendment\nAnd one of the things my students walk out of my classroom understanding each year is is that Congress actually has far more power than most Americans think they do and essentially everything that Donald Trump is doing right now if you like it then you should maintain a Republican Congress and if you're just like it you should try to overturn Congress\nI was thinking about um

that is coming up today is tremendously engaged in politics and cares about what's happening I think they're also very skeptical if not cynical about our national politics and\nWith their part one example you bring up I think that's actually demonstrative of what I was talking about earlier about state politics\nOr the national conversation about gun control policy is basically dead and it doesn't matter what happens there'll be a national movement there is room for movement of the state level and if you look at the Parkland shooting a those kids went to the floor to Capitol not the

[noise]\nHi I'm Dennis O'Hare host of the political breakfast cast on Ninety One WABC there and Johnson Brian Robin ... and I want you to know we're serving up alive evening diner edition of the\nShouldn't speak to the bells about what happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram wire partly a I mean they was you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative\nBut also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them in the government's safe house in early July so it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks\nSo it was quite rule they um with still processing one that happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us when our counselors to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened though we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBuddy clearly anytime we were alone with the girls the government mind as an security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government also wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because they were held the three is the full ... down and they were released well\nWhat do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um they was free to speak to his of they did give us the diaries discreetly\n... and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they\nWere forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they called us and the full Boko Haram treatment ... ah and then the phone what we do is\nThe uh the bills that you book goes who have taken was actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands of girls in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram who are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the\nTestimony we get a sense of what happened to the to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because ah you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one\nGirl in your film who was married had a kid ah with somebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's of Boko Haram baby\n[noise] yes say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the film is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier or you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave then you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the golf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it's say see you know as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met had like she she did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my maybe of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually\nWere kidnapped as well uh and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ... have either been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay about ... has been conducting children but I Will say oh the men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fight\nPalm tree can adapt to Trump at the fronds as the wind blows so that without having to have a lot of material structure\nThey can adapt to wins and therefore we see palm trees you know near hurricane a coastal regions whereas a large oak tree which was mass events different strong can be uprooted\nUnlike turbans we see today these blades face away from the wind like at Penn will you blow from behind the

the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy\n... more or less what do we have fought for the kids they listen to ... take on prime time with a five minute we can't we can't say whether they live for\nThe Sunday Edition sponsored by Google race\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind this\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that\nAudiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAll right let's take this first change Fox is calling it the nine ... nine second sixty second breast sorry to be nine sixty seconds breaks jazz pods jackpots what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and see which means that traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second year this has got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nAnd then also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute blocker branded content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and ... and a and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the ... so they could be double or triple\nThe standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume do advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air is worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRight as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain a John Carroll\nNow media analyst thanks very much and I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the

from the top conversations with business leaders\nSame your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars ... and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car over population by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car and you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that all cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specifics how get around works right now it's available in what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed and that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity\nWhen what\nReally shapes and a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of times they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted but Ninety five percent of teens I'm outta smartphone now and\nIt it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to your friends text instantly to want to be the first to post a like a ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but

seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening [noise]\nOne of the things that's happening is the changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty they start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular I'm more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black\nWomen are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior slain that sure well\nIf I Am a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is I don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a large\nThe black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated because their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school and if you are in a school like that the honor students are black\nBut if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like\nThen you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting why it's such a vicious cycle because very often\nThe kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is this sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in and in fact tracking often does result in re segregation would end racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about\nThe kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed\nIn those upper tracks you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book\nBut to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores still not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us\nA member in the book that you can read about that one too but uh it it was included in the magical mystery to films so it did go out on television but you didn't hear on radio at the time\nKevin hell thank you so much for talking to ... you know\nIf I Do as far\nAs that goes up\nAnd all\nOf

created the memorable dancer Ruth Peter Pan the king and I\nBoth makes the case that these hockey was teases kept Robbins from assuming his proper place in dance\nThat because he was decided as one of the twenty century most powerful story too low brow for the more abstract world of Chinese rebel a second tier Jewish balancing this week Russia's going choreographer and cofounder of the New York city ballet who hired a thirty\nOne year old Robbins in Nineteen forty nine to be that companies associate artistic director\nAuthor Wendy lesser says she's made it her vow her sworn duty to overturn the prevailing miss about Robbins her new book Jerome Robbins a life in dance and she joins us now when the lesser welcome thank you for having me Robyn just you know thinking of the west Side Story scenes that we that are now in our minds\nYou write attitude that I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets snapping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because your own Robbins had trenches dug\nThat's right and if you go back and see the movie and\nI have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing of\nThem in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius\nIn that field it's just that uh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches\nDug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer and I\nThink it will be fabulous well so how did this start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the one hundreds centennial of John Robbins birth\nCertainly knew about his work says we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the German Robbins Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to of course music from Bach let's just listen to a little\n\n\n\nOkay so you will have all of the of videos that we talk about here at here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it [noise]\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program\nAnd to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live in a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks style\nFriendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all\nFeeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of death than to say that had the feeling of October variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan manned fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the faint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because there was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and Deborah Joe it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that Arlene crochet had panned it and that she was hit most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful\nBallet critic of her generation and you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called your Robbins affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you were going up Robbins words as a belly choreographer\nThey haven't uh this is this initially when the Republicans saying it's not just that the president and Mitch McConnell we've had it from the treasury secretary at that this is this is due to spending which is largely driven by\nThe Democrats but actually if you look at the numbers at spending as it went up\nThree percent but government tax receipts was flat\nAnd they should have been going up this is a strong economy where people would be paying more taxes and you know there was some increases in individual in self employment taxes which were driven by economic growth but but the the bottom line is the corporate tax got isn't she made that council that\nOut so we have a station when tax receipts a flat display despite this been economy and that really can only be attributed to the gym tax cut\nWhat about the terrorists are they helping out at all to be charging a feed basically on all the goods coming in for example from China\nSo there is a section at the treasury app pulled out who's customs duties an excise taxes and they did say that the hurry fractional increase in tax receipts that we saw and physical twenty Eighteen at\nThat was partly due to an increase in those days at that may or may not be due to the highest it's difficult to know exactly ... that's potentially opposed to sign but that's not a part of this German when you look at the role of of the trade war with China is that China is still\nThe U.S as big as foreign credit to the biggest foreign and have US government bonds the more the you as far as\nThe more pain to countries like China and interest\nSo works both ways uh just quickly Seventeen percent increase overall and the deficit when was the last time we saw something like that\nSo that kind of dissent has jumped while a Senate it's a big one for this year is not entirely unusual in twenty Fifteen at when we saw the the usa deficit hit it hit a low that we hadn't seen since eleven and seven I jumped ... percent in twenty six but I think the point is this is a booming economy we don't need to be the right and\nOf course Avastin CNN Business correspondent thank you thank you you're listening to hear now [noise]\nAnd there's much more still

had\nInternational and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis is here and now every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax returns to the public but Donald Trump has not here's Trump on sixty minutes after he was elected in November twenty sixteen\nAt the appropriate time I will ... so what do I now under routine other nobody cares still cares is you know you and a few people that us and question obviously the public didn't care because I Won the election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI fall on the German and ways and means just stopped delaying it get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law and former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now\nHi Jeremy so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business\nAnd directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in our confidential manner um but it can important agents such as a staffer at outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think\nGiven the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee shared to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of\nIs ... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate that's exactly right so either committee or any\nThe committee's can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol leave the Senate could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation\nTo submit any of the information that its obtained through the full house or the full Senate\nAnd presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote that committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories or the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a fall there\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee and the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it's searching it but I\nI think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action what is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances of the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here

involved in Margie and I'm going to get involved with this charity I Want to like you know I Do college um show sometimes like stand up and like they're talking about mid term elections and like when I was in college and I went to ...\nNew York I never talked about midterms that maybe they knew what the mid term elections where so I was just kind of like really inspired by like the younger generation being like on top of it in a way that like I certainly wasn't in my late teens and early twenties and so I was like oh I think we're going to be okay I think they're gonna like\nThey're going to help us get through like the kind of stressful time reliving it right now\nThere's a there's a a really great um [laughter]\nI don't know if it's weird saying great because it's about something terrible has happened to you yeah there are you in the book you describe um you describe a lot of like being single and going on dates like sort of terrible landscape that we live in there um and you talked about this experience [laughter] we're actually\nDemonstrated a demonstrated exercises that you could do to tone up\nYou know yeah there I Know\nWhat I mean you're figures perfect Barry [laughter]\nI'm I'm Wondering like well yeah I started rude yeah I'm the\nBut you talk about how like you you sort of climbed up and you you didn't say anything at the time\nUm and obviously you're very confident now outspoken um is there any advice that you could give to I mean I Know that you're going to be speaking at Scott and um is there any advice that you could give two two young women out there about\nFinding that agency to speak up and speak out a ... and ... on yourself\nYeah I think you know most women feel this way that you you grow up sort of being conditioned to\nPlease everyone and not say what you think or if you're uncomfortable just sort of like [laughter] I'm just going to laugh it off and it's okay\nAnd I think you know I certainly had to get to a place and I think most women do we can go I can be confident in saying the word no I can be confident in standing up for myself and that doesn't mean that I'm a weird person as a mean that I mean as me and I'm Crazy it means that I'm respecting myself\nAnd so I think in those moments where your instinct is to like oh well I don't want to upset the other person source or just like swallow this disrespect if you could just sort of condition yourself and just kind of speak up and be like hey you know what that actually make me feel great team not say that to me again\nAnd you know sometimes guys might be like whoa whoa whoa like you're being weird but then other times he might be like\nOh yeah I didn't even think that I was being rude or mean or whatever and so it could be like a teachable moment for both people\nBut it's a process I mean really took me a lot like in my twenties I was definitely not like standing up for myself at all and like I got older and I was just kind of like life is too short to just pretend like everything is okay every time we were like mistreated you know yeah I like\nThe title of your first book was you know don't\nTouch my hair yeah [laughter] I'm\nLike you know you've been on this journey yeah there you know to be you know finding agency a um can you talk about what sort of what you learned in doing that first book that you've carried over to to this one\nYeah I think I just gave my confidence as a writer or like you know before I was doing blogging rewrite maybe five hundred words you know that's it and like in a book you like have to be able to tell a story like some essays are thirty pages long you have to be able to keep a narrative going um and then I think also it's a first book\nI don't know of other writers vote this way but you know I went to college I say like a lot of like straight white male writers and I was like oh I don't sound like them so I don't know if this is actually good and so for me it became a process of like making sure I'm measuring myself against me like using myself as mine North Star\nRather than the sort of outside influence and I think that helped me be more confident with this book fantastic Phoebe I understand\nWhy Michele Bhutto is your third do could I be the queen number four\nYes of course a good thing I can tell you that is the Tom Hanks voicemail equivalent for me to be your fourth do quit

has her eyes on the sky once again today she is launching a new initiative called look up for one day today Jason wants people to upload photos of the sky and record their reactions to what they see\nMe jealous and joins us now to talk about a welcome to hear now thank you\nSo you're asking people to download this app sky fee and upload photos tax videos audio recordings of themselves experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do\nWhat we're asking them to share what happens when they look up at the sky daytime nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside and looking up will help us to understand\nMaybe a little bit more about each other and it's still just a tiny bit more connected around this planet so you know some people will look up the sky and they will feel love they'll fill whole fill fill some people may feel afraid they may feel wonder are expensive\nAnd how they express that is what we want to capture and we want to have a shared with people in real time so it's not just you're going to take these photos and you've got to put them up\nWe're going to display them to the world in real time on a digital globe that people can spin and they can look at that can expand they can go to different folks around the world so I can no in Houston, Texas what someone is thinking in New Zealand\n[noise] so I I have to say I love looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of Marjah guy period yeah nice guy right in a nice guy well but but in the sky period and and in the last couple of months we've been able to see for planets or every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus\nAnd I've I've taken great pride in telling people about that but the other feeling that I often have when I look up because I live in the city is disappointment that I can see more because of there's the light pollution\nBut well I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and being more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are where even seen our impact\nOn this planet and so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people think we're always talking about stars right\nBut it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night\nIn each time there's this then shimmering layer of light that ... is our atmosphere it's this planet that warns us in cools us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nWill so it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change\n[noise] well I Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we have these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happens when we're\nCome face to face that I can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to this guy something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts\nLike you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have no I actually\nHow to purify human waste so it doesn't make cholera and what's going to happen when the polar ice caps melting that means a naval build up in the Arctic so all the issues that you would think liberal NGOs would be talking about\nAre talked about every day by people in

there was three deaths\nAnd Rodney at you or an hour north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nRight we took a shooting at a cat so we look at for which is somewhat\nUsual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm although a lot of places and people will realize that they stole it does affect people that deep inland and when you've got a storm of this magnitude and movie as fast as it did it held together a lot better and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you understand your home was hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged has pretty much it it it is destroyed the the structure stood the house basically over pressurized and blue part I'm a roof off and we're hoping to get some some adjusted today\nYeah well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us that's on now in what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and if it's the damage is it just off the scales bad and buildings down almost every country has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that have used to live here and come back so they don't even recognize a town\nWell the county appraiser currently the cocktail the Tampa Bay to be in that cheese guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county ... county we damage she's using tax rules an aerial pictures that you sent\nA sense that we all we had a\nCrew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plush are completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nNow with Gulf Power spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had it to rebuild the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd an actor big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were told to do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally the power companies did everything they could do\nI can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome as difficult job and they have had very aggressive programs to bring back those trees to upgrade the grid\nAnd I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done it absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nOh what what are some of the issues because I I think we heard in one report that horizon is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does run the twin towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood it's just they were so much debris though they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped so they were not transmitting\nNow you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to fund a study on storm response failed in the state legislature in twenty Seventeen\nDo you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level a emergency convening on what to do going forward\nWe're looking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike asking Romney just briefly um does there have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know if it's so much climate change as it is is just a natural process that occurs over the\nYears you don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast right in town down and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that and this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me at my level it's not a question of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee that this will change the climate of my community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County and Mariana Florida we wish you the best case I get very much Mm\nWell parts of the country are lucky enough to be in Paris season so we want to take a closer look with here now resident Jeff ... who is

there anything Democrats can do to stop Republicans from doing this\n[noise] [noise] yeah they can win elections Republicans control the White House and Donald Trump has been nominating these young conservatives for the federal bench and Republicans control the Senate which has the advice and consent function here so if Democrats really want to do something\nThey're going to need to win more elections now if you talk to\nA progressive advocates and activists out there and they say that Democrats could have been firmer and standing up last week and not agreeing to this deal to confirm Fifteen federal judges before they left town for the recess or there are some things on the margins that Democrats could do more of\nBut by and large the Republicans hold the power here and they're using it\nAnd just give us a sense of what we missed yesterday who got through\nYes so then the main focus of yesterday's hearing was a young woman lawyer named Allison rushing she's been nominated to

century\n... there were arrangements that were made this piece went viral it's time you could say there were ...\nFor a mandolin for piano for saxophone for public choir with a Latin text added\nSo does this piece has been popular well before Nineteen fifty five and the fun thing about the lady killers and to use in the film this was a word that's written for a string quartet to violins viola\nCello was an additional cello\nNo there is a joke about the film it's either an error in the film or it's an additional joking that these crooks pose as a string quintet with an additional viola and not with a cello somebody should have been on to this guys are walking around without a second child is\nYou know the other film that it's in one of my favorites is terrorists dealers day

out what that meant exactly but there you have it he's not singing necessarily but he is a humming along to the to the tin\nBobby McFerrin is being Bobby ... and I think it's a fascinating arrangement of it for our time if you like this piece you should know that Luigi ... wrote over a hundred string quintet this is one simple minuet from one quintet so there's a lot more there to explore\nHe was writing these for the younger brother of the Spanish king\nDome release and while he was doing that he was writing string quartets for royalty and playing the additional channel himself so he was doing this so that he could play along with them and then he would also right\nString queen tests for depression king who was a cellist so he had a lot of opportunities to write to string Quinn tests

Waltzer rooms\nWell so first of all clarify for us because driving around this was driven home we're in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes are not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are homes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have that insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have\nThat way to to begin rebuilding their homes will and\nRebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Nikki Gilmore a Walmart manager in Mariana who said people showing up for work even though they have to really trying circumstances let's hear\nWe're getting some terminated called one that gives them the ability of last\nAnd so I've got like ... it's just a measure we call him Jae su loss is allowed\nAfter two days here\nOur through to smile immigration just describe what just friday has a job that he can recover and a lot of shows you that\nThere's more calls\nWhen he says we got air he means is he conditioning air conditioned right how are people getting by if they have no income I think that it's\nTough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about it Gilmore had opened his door and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process or that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck\nThere is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state but again that's difficult for\nA fisherman who maybe don't have a good way of tracking what their income has been and say they don't have a good way of applying for that assistance\nYeah but running water mostly back in some places it's not drinkable communications as we have discovered are still pretty spotty um it's just really ... I have to say it's just remarkable to see the trees uprooted everywhere even here you know inland Tallahassee rules off high school fifty miles inland\nReally based California the rockers insure you guys\nBack during his [noise] yeah I mean they're definitely they stood the test of time and they really really huge rock big pop rocks\nDown we're talking young majority yeah yes yes but they are definitely in the alternative lane it's been a minute since they've been here and and now they're going to be back I'm sure this show Steve that some people are going to be a cop jam I think they probably encourage that that's fine it's Halloween weekend as well\nHalloween is until mid week but who knows what he's saying\nThe Halloween is for an entire month yeah I I Know people who celebrate homerun in July of June so I'm totally down with that that young the giant at the rocks the Saturday Night\nHere's a show that I'm most excited about this is probably my top pick for the weekend and she was actually just hear W.

serving their archaeologist under white canopy excavating a pet ... feet wide three feet and millennia deep\nCSP lined up Jewish right to make it work properly or I got a four point seven six to ... yeah you're on it on a good game\nOn Dr Andy ... with your solar research Institute and we are at the edge of a pit that we're excavating dating from modern stuff right at the top all the way down to potentially maybe Fifteen thousand years ago some of the earliest occupation that only in Florida but in the new world wow\nWe're kind of just getting to the the good stuff as we get through the earliest Holocene material and get into the end of the ice age the end of the the terminal place of the material will be looking at things in the twelve to fourteen and it's like I said as much as Fifteen thousand year old rage\n[noise]\nBucket you're lined up shovels gently pushed across to pitch floor ... thousands of years with everything you're careful exacting lurk you never know what you might\nHave been used findings stone tools just so many knocked a big play golf he was really sharp on one edge so they took a little on what a piece of amber or another hammer stone perhaps interest sharp\nEnded up a little bit more a drill the tip of broken off of that and we're probably guessing and again in the five six thousand year old range part of today's excitement has been that we had a little lens of charcoal\nAnd as we dug it out this morning it started to have some structure to it a Tom said perhaps corn cob if you're a corn cob shouldn't be in nine thousand year old dirt share but it's conceivable [noise]\nSo so that'll be that'll be the excitement this afternoon is removing this little pedestal that's got quite a bit of charcoal in it [noise]\n[noise]\nJust scraped materially dumped into the bucket and poured out of all it looks like a screen door laying on its side on lakes now move over here to a screen everybody knows at this list\nIt's framed and you're brushing that than through what are you looking for\nA ... a little pieces of stone that we were when they were making a projectile point\nIs that when they're put it right in the [noise] these are tiny tiny scissors drinking\nAnd I'm a ... or and sharpening arrowhead for a project will point and then make these little tiny ...\nThere are some went down there for a larger one it's a half a quarter of an inch long yeah there's one\nHow do you know that's what they were doing with it [noise]\nThere's some may have for the call your permanent march festivals where people are making narrow it today and this is a double Taj that is what's on the floor after you're making a same during appointed hoping that this was probably ten thousand years old [noise]\nI just touch something ten thousand you know ... school [noise]\nIt's not me it wasn't my hand that Dr heading who just wiped out a few hundred years of history with one for them to someone who was a mess up your [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nIt's funny but the reason he slipped may not be artifacts are most beneficial to archaeologist they reveal their stories best when they're found where they were left and storms like recent hurricane Michael can disturb that\nIf you stand in place long enough you can feel the same ... pressing a little bit and it's because you know snow into problems in education\nDo you think that's the rain as you as you shake your fist at the elements to just now\nIt importantly [laughter] um\nBut these things are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they're in place and not currently ... and that's really why we were so very concerned is that we have an open excavation pit almost a meter deep with soils that have not seen the letter day for the better part a nine thousand years we've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps sandbag the whole thing\nAnd we we are awful awful lot [noise]\nAnd so they continue the work that was started by a man who devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes with laid\nThe original work was done by the state archaeologist Calvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the large in Nineteen Ninety four and that's what some of the most important earliest points were made\nCalvin Jones isn't he the one who got a real barrel of loan delivered to
