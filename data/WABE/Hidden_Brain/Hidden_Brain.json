picture is one of the of of humor right I mean the city's elites making fun of people who are blue collar people [noise]\nThat's right and I mean one of the things that blue collar people our debt ethic of self discipline and hard work is so central to them and they're you know they're very proud of their ability to go to these often not very fulfilling jobs\nDay after day after day for forty years straight and I think here if my father in law who went um did they did exactly that he worked in a factory that made\nThose machines that measure the humidity and museums and he was an inspector he hated\nHis job he went to it for forty years and he was proud of doing a good job while he was at work or he was proud of the work that he did and he took it seriously and he worked very hard and he deserved dignity for that\nAnd one of the things that I've been trying to explain to people is that these jobs are important jobs you know when I get up in the morning and I turn on the top it's not because of some knowledge workers that water comes out it's because of some blue collar person\nAnother thing that strikes me and this is actually from a really fascinating article studying class in sitcoms\nIs Marge in the Simpson is depicted as a smarter and more responsible and more grown up than Homer\nSimpson is and that's a pattern in American sitcoms where I'm In if you look at professional miniature families in sitcoms it's father knows best and mothers good support but if you look at working class families in sitcoms\nThe the woman is smarter and often the children are smarter than the gym with his dad so it's like kind of a class are front\nAnd the gender of front exacerbating the class of front\nYou and your husband come from different backgrounds or your the fourth generation of lawyer in your family and you went to jail and Harvard and MIT your husband came from blue collar roots or here's what you call it a class Mike rent\nA telling me about a high school reunion he wants attended at and the question she asked for former classmate and what this exchange reveal to you [noise]\nYes so we went back to his high school reunion and you know I'm the anthropologist he's not so she did what he had come to be used to in upper middle class circles he asked one of his classmates what do you do absolutely the standard question my crowd and uh\nThat his classmate was really offended that classmate put his face very close to my husband's face he got beat red and he said I\nSell toilets [noise] and he obviously felt\nThat the what do you do question was a class insult from um [noise] virtually the only member of their high school class from this blue collar a rust belt town that had made it\nAnd what that really shows you what is the again going back to the classroom culture doubt well why does my crowd why do we ask each other what do you do what we do because it's a form of social display\nWhat do I do I'm a law professor that's a form of social honor what the I sell toilets comment meant is that I'm not just a man who sells toilet you don't just boil me down to my job my job is not who I Am\nAnd also it shows that that guy needed to keep close to home in a small circle of friends and acquaintances who knew no he's not just the guy who ... his social on her is not portable\n\n\nJones says new color families feel resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath her\nShe told me a personal story about her sister in law\nWho comes from a blue collar background she walked at a daycare that's a low income families and she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford to shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... she was very angry when the ... she was in head start she was teaching in ... as a head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying white Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as keeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty or straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living drug sex rock and roll\nUm didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise]\nJoan says working class people have come to a few but government benefits and government programs are not for them when our own working class father in law started to suffer from dementia Jones suggested to her mother in law that you apply for some help\nHer reaction was striking [noise]\nMade her reaction was oh I'm not even gonna bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us it just cares about the poor\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they deliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her assumption you\nKnow it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the programs and of the political elites to make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped\nThe ball one of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book is that the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan in their outlook and people who are not\nHow's it going to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or Shanghai but there are also people in the u._k. and in the U.S who are routed to the community in a way that's very different\nAnd in some ways they resent the people who are costs will politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same ties with the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do [noise]\nThat's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but breaks it end Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump\nBut the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP\nThe twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third\nThe people who voted both for ... and for Trump where those people who were left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people who have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nDay actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the ...\nNational managerial lead toward more focused on individual achievement and self development\nWhen you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to their work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the exchange does your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes it's a it's a form of social display\nBut it's also a form of saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work is what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of of of persevering and staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nUm elites are completely defined by their jobs you know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a techie\nUm this total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nHis working class but it is also light something traumatic as happened with white voters over the last half century ... no as a political scientist at the University of California San Diego alone was Ogden Hi no she's coauthor of the book white backlash\nImmigration race and American politics says the shift of white voters from the Democratic to the Republican Party\nHas been dramatic over the last forty years\nYes indeed a so one of the biggest shift I think that we have experienced in the last three to four decades are that racial and ethnic compositions of who makes up democratic and Republican voters today\nAnd much of that has to do with the fact that whites are defecting away from the Democratic party um and solidly aligning themselves to the Republican Party whereas the Democratic party or as the party that has become much more ethnically and racially diverse today\nSo the fact that people of color are gravitating toward the Democratic party and whites are gravitating towards the Republican Party this isn't a new finding but but you you are humorous that a significant portion of this trend is being driven by one specific political issue\nYes uh so my colleague as was the only high now and I that is the main thesis of this of this book is that the\nIssue of immigration is one of the main ... factors that's driving white voters away from the Democratic party and as a result of what we're seeing a we are definitely having this realignment if you will\nOf the ethnic and racial makeup of that are two major political parties so you are not the first callers to identify the immigration matters in politics but it's but as I read your book it struck me you've come to a new understanding of just how much immigration\nMatters and that's right so it's not it's not this novel finding that\nImmigration matters we've known that for a long time but I think what we're really trying to push forward is that is very essential piece of American politics partisanship and something that we hold so central to every sort of\nExplanation of how people behave in politics that that is really as being tremendously shaped by how folks think about immigration\n... there's been a longstanding debate and political science about the effects of partisanship but I remember talking to a number of experts over the years who've said\nPartisanship and party loyalty is such a powerful force of many of us often arrive at our views on policy matters after we have pledged allegiance to one side or the other it's almost like\nFollowing a sports team you know why you decided to follow a sports team and then you start to like all the things that the sports team does and this thesis would argue\nThat people's views on immigration are shaped by that partisan loyalties and otherwise you'd people decide that party loyalties fortunate that decides\nHow do you think about immigration in some ways you are arguing the opposite you're seeing how people think about immigration shapes the way they think about party\nYeah so anytime any researchers choose to study partisanship it's always a very intimidating force because as you said there's so much research on it and we feel like this is the one thing that we know so much about but\nAgain when we started doing all this data analysis looking at how American voters behaved over the past Twenty years it was really remarkable that even if we took say\nHow they felt about immigration two years prior to a presidential election or any election that that would still be a very strong predictor of their their vote choice in that subsequent election\nWhich means to suggest then that it was\nImmigration that was explaining partisanship as opposed to vice versa\nLet's step back for a second and just paint a picture of how you've arrived at this thesis or you say that since two thousand the United states has absorbed in extraordinary number of immigrants and in some ways and will be very surprising if the sewage did not have a profound effect on politics\nExactly as states like California Texas we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you point out account for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of the friction intention that's at the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public uh\nThe fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that it for the average American voter or you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected we'd walk polls show more is a half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants are a burden to us society and it's like majority saying that Latinos after the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n[noise]\nRapid demographic shifts ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class [noise] these threats come in different forms [noise]\nCultural [laughter]\nEconomic threat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political tracts\nWhy do Republicans on the hill understand the\nThreat advance policy as opposed to the country and to them\nYou have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have these rapid demographic\nShift you also have these increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive\nTo the anxiety of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really taken all of these\nMultiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message in theme that can really again mobilize their voters\nAnd the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have a central message such as immigration that can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues that they want to advocate for\nThere's been some criticism that well this is a short term strategy and if they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou've also looked at what happens in states as the demographics of states start to change so as the Latino populations in states starts to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters well\nWhat you typically see is that as the population of a\nLatino voters have increased you start to see the shift in\nThe political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh that would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen election so\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... into the ... of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and our analysis is that from all these different angles not just of you know I'm cool white voters supported\nBut also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was really just that immigration was such a strong and important predictor in all of these different a political outcomes that we were exploring and so\nI think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration\nThat currently the political climate we live in today [noise]\nAnd\nWhen we come back what ... thesis about a white backlash means for politics and elections [noise]\n\nYou're listening to hidden brain I'm Shankar Vedantam stay with us this is NPR\nBoth\nSupport for WABC comes from the

behave like the starving men in Minnesota the poor people who are\nLacking financial resources\nFrom a very hard to think about anything but money or do we spend a lot of the resources a lot of their attention\nOn financial juggling\nStarvation make people upset super food poverty make people obsess over how they were going to make ends meet how to make it to next week\nWhat's in common in both cases of your head is busy with the thing you're going to have enough of\nThe two researchers found they were on to something maybe they thought the human brain is wired to respond to scarcity like tunneling in on the thing that's missing center says this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective\nPicture that you have somebody from twenty five thousand years ago it was basically a hunter gatherer [noise] and who might need to do a variety of things such as you know get water do you know a lot of resources are needed when they get hungry as for the evolutionary sister who wants to have an alarm that says have\nReally focused on getting food into the system [noise] and that I think is the basic scarcity and the poor hungry and then this things started going off in the head thing do you realize we're hungry and I mentioned we're hungry we're hungry and just keeps calling out team for Brandi drew\nThe alarm might have sounded like this you don't have the necessities your family

wait a minute why didn't you save at least a hundred dollars for gas\nThe answer to that question central and as I Believe has to do with what's Cassidy did to brandy she was so focused on getting the basic necessities that she didn't have the mental capacity to attend to anything else\nThere is a technical term for this it's called bandwidth\nIf you're downloading a movie on your home life I find that you might find your email runs a little slower the movie is hogging all the available ... ... say our minds work exactly the same way if your mind is consumed with thoughts about something there isn't room to think about other stuff\nScarcity fills the mind with intrusive thoughts about what you do not have it doesn't leave room for anything else\nAs our says there's a simple way to demonstrate this you imagine trying to hold an eight digit number in your head\nAnd if I simply ask you to keep in mind you know to six or seven one six for that just leaves you with less able to attend to other stuff you use less well you'll pay attention to those things are so\nAs you're saying that they just now and now I I didn't hear the rest of us like they're trying to remember that how are you guys have your number one starts grounded [laughter] but then the sense that it's kind of a metaphor so when you were busy juggling resources worrying about you know how am I going to be for dinner and if they were going to be able to have money for school trip\nJust suck keeping an eye digit number in your head [noise] there's a reason\nOur minds with this way tunneling into something makes you focus on it everything inside the tunnel becomes crystal clear the problem is you can't see anything outside the\nPeople in the poverty ... are actually very good at figuring out how to stretch the money they have to make it to tomorrow or the next week studies show that the poor tend to be better than the rich at knowing where you can find the best deals\nTube of toothpaste someone who is poor as often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like the utility bill or gas money or credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the price was in a number and the prices and figure out if you took care of all you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things are paying less attention to your rescue could homework do the of the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have\nThe lonely tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result is they try too hard to be like in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to what's actually being set the conversation falter instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward flat footed what happens\nAs a result people do voice the ... and the only person becomes even lonely [noise] this lands offers a new way of thinking about white people who find themselves in scarcity seemed to do things that\nTo an outsider look stupid when you're in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper Sanders says we're asking the wrong question\nWhat if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty make everyone\nLess capable of that it's the it's it's you\nAnd I tomorrow will be to become poor or with all of a sudden have the same effect that poverty is in some sense changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some bleeding ... theory to excused irresponsible behavior and out in San Diego wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugar cane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once that money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor and a month after harvest well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the farmers on that long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nAnd we found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich and to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched other research that shows for example that farmers who are well off tend to read that feels more regularly than farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short term thinking\n... it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely\nBut they might be another former scarcity you have experienced\nOn some days that we get to leave at four pm some days we don't leave till one AM\n[laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning and usually work\nEighty hours a week\nWe'll

business that or I wouldn't make mistakes that it's not clear educating me in quotes about ... helped me at all just makes life all the more complicated\nWhen people in poverty fail or make mistakes the researchers think we should respond to them the same way we respond to mistakes made by airline pilots\nThere was a time not long ago when we thought that airline pilots who made mistakes which is bad pilots center says a big reason add travelers become safer in recent decades is that there's been a shift in thinking about such mistakes\nDesigners have made cockpits fault tolerant rather than trying to find perfect pilots cockpits are not designed to account for human era the goal is to alert pilots when they've made a mistake and to diminish the consequences of mistakes\nIt's ironic that when we design cockpits the entire mantra fault tolerance seem so intuitive but when you design social policies nobody's out there talking about let's make this fault tolerant I mean you know poor people have a lot on their mind or band with tax they're going to make mistakes let's make sure this program as robust when they do make that mistake it's\nJust not the way we think if I offer a

to come on the fourth day and still feel caught up in fact our training curriculum is often quite the opposite if you missed three days in a row it's an invitation to miss the fourth day you're not

several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager [noise] root discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers learn a lot about the private lives of their clients\nAnd they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\n\nParent and welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples are the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager\nI Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins a series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me\nUm maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nPreferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some ways to get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spots\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that the average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children but\nThey're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm trying to be a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financing the law but this kind of wrote
