debt [noise] having a a\nWorld paw wound on my hand was much harder to explain away\nMaybe I put too much pressure on the brain and that sent a signal through the dead muscles to make the paw flick and it caught my glove just write that has to be it because the only other explanation is that I just skin to the squirrel alive [noise]\n\nIt did occur to me several times to just stop\nIt felt like I was going to be heard from that point on to never have\nAnother good experience with taxidermy which would be devastating [noise]\nLike what if I'm done what if it's gonna be like this with every animal from now on\nI got as far as picking everything up to throw it out but if I had given up it would have been a huge step backwards\nI popped on a new glove clipped the wrists and the or ankles up the carcass I buried it in a plastic tub under about ten pounds of salt\nSo that it could dehydrate and put her on the shelf underneath my uh underneath my bedroom window and went to bed and\n[noise]\nI could barely sleep that night because the scratch just was dropping and every time it ... I thought about the world [noise]\n\nThe next morning I woke up\nAnd all I have to do is change to solve\nCan't possibly get as weird as it was yesterday [noise]\nI took the big bag of salt outside when I open the tub that had the skin inside the skin was sitting\nUp halfway out of the salt as if it did for road up for air like I saw him be getting up from its grave [noise]\n\nIt was just sitting there\nStaring at me with these empty island [noise]\nThe ties kind of\nSticking up reaching out [noise]\nThere's no way the dead holiday world pushed its way up to ten pounds so there was also no way that anybody has touched it because they all think it's disgusting [noise]\n\nI just dumped out the salt buried again put it on the shelf and\nWalked away from it for I expected it to be a very long time\n[noise]\nOne morning while I was finishing my coffee I heard a squirrel start barking [noise]\n\nAnd I for a second I throws because I'm thinking oh my God it's bits back it wants revenge but it was just another squirrel outside\n\nI just felt sad thinking that you know well dang this world that\nI was\nSo afraid of it also used to nibble and Kate burn scanner and art and um [noise]\nMarrying nuts and oh it just kind of just kind of all hit me that this was a living thing and it had I don't know dignity I went back to\nThe salt and uh you know the ...\nWas actually still in there it hadn't tried to escape again [noise] but I just opened it up\nI felt like I go to an apology and I started talking to it so I said look I'm Sorry I\nDidn't listen because I think that you were telling me to stop before I even started\nThe only thing that I Want to do is preserve you and make you last forever\nSo the next morning I woke up\nAnd I walked out on the porch and looked up in the big oak tree that's right over the fence I saw a brown squirrels not medium size really bushy tailed with a white tip [noise]\n\nThe ... that was identical to the one I mean you know currently modifying under ten pounds of salt in a tub a few feet away from me\nHow common is that if it had like a a ... is there like snowflakes you know\n[noise]\nI just wanted to see what would happen so I took an own in between my Simon finger [noise] and I just\nHeld it out and\nSure enough the squirrel jumped from the tree onto the railing of my balcony and hopped along the railing until it got\nTo my hand maybe my hand was shaking like crazy this cultural sniff me so close that I felt it snows on my finger tip\n[noise] and then it grabs almonds\nIn its teeth [noise] turned around [noise] hopped over to the other end of the fence jumped to the tree [noise] climbed up back to that branch and looked at me again [noise]\nAnd we just made eye contact for another couple seconds [noise]\nAnd it just dashed back up into the tree [noise] it just it was like a disappeared before even reached the top of the branches\nSo I was just be completely re energized and I was ...

Charles Washington post and then I just moved on with my day\nCynthia the one who ignore the email at first did some extra research to find out who she could contact she poked around on line and ...

be in serious danger [noise]\nI remember that was a snow day in Washington and\nMy daughter was off school so I just close my computer and I took her outside and we played in the snow and I remember laying in the ground and we made snow angels and I just thought God I Hope this guy is okay [noise]\nCynthia didn't hear back from down is not the next day or the day after that or the day after that\nBut didn't they didn't stop thinking about him and then one day she heard back from his niece and she said\nThank you for reaching out to me I Am Dennis Williams nice and he did commit suicide\n[noise]\nI was just got it is the best way to describe it it's out it felt like someone had punched me in the stomach\nThat feeling lasted for days and weeks and [noise]\nI guess like any grieving process maybe it sounds strange to say the grieving process because I didn't know him I wasn't a family member of his but [noise] it's lingered for a while that I had this connection now to this person but he had very\nDeliberately reached out to establish\nThis connection and that that it hadn't worked out the way I'm Better movie version of it whatever down where I Would have somehow figured out a way to say um\n[noise]\nCynthia decided to do some research into who Dennis was in the process she found out that she wasn't the only one to get the email so she called some of them up to see how they had reacted too and she was the one that told all of them about Dennis his death like Cynthia dare I hadn't stopped wondering what happened to Dan is\nAs upsetting as it was ... when she and I were sort of talking about the timing and it became clear that in fact when I received this message that morning with my children all running over my house he was already dead this horrible\nToo but it does kind of help to know that nothing I could have done that morning would've made any difference I don't know why who cares whether it makes no difference to me um but it does make me feel a little less wretched about it but you don't\n[noise] our lives are predicated on this kind of coal dust though right\nCynthia I'm like the rest of them may have gotten the email when Dennis was still alive but what is truly impossible to know is even if she had emailed him right when she got it that night when she was checking your email in the middle of the night would it have made any difference [noise]\nWhen Cynthia talk to his ex wife cake out she found out the dentist always plan on doing that [noise]\nHe always said what he had said in the email when his work was done so does he\nHave a strange none of this or that all of a surprise to kick out [noise]\nGet emailed her to right before he killed himself he asked her not to be sad I'm happy to be sad [noise]\nAnd he went up to the roof of his hotel\nAnd he jumped [noise]\n\nWhen I've talked to people about this in the past months and months since that's happened\nBears some folks who say well you know could you have done more and ... were you being cold about it but he didn't ask for help in fact he said he was resigned to doing this that he had decided I'm not asking of any anything he specifically says that in part of the ladder\nUm he just wanted his ideas to survive [noise]\nHe left very few people behind among them a daughter who he denies and who he was a strange from he popped into the lives of few strangers in his last few hours and then he disappeared altogether but not before asking cake out his ex wife to be sure to keep his Facebook in blog up just in case someone got curious about\nHis work that was the part that upset me the idea that he felt that this was what was important and his wife\nAnd nothing else mattered to the point where he was going to kill themselves because there was nothing else in his life that mattered you know I\nI've been very fortunate to have had a fair amount of success as a writer and so perhaps it's not fair for me to see this because perhaps I Would feel differently if I weren't as successful as I've been but\nIt would never occur to me that\nMy writing was the most important thing that I had contributed to this world\nI have another hour and a aspects of my career I'm a scholar of yet and Hebrew literature and I'll say that\nWhen you study English literature you know a whole lot about forgotten writers most of the books on my shelves were literally saved from the garbage I Am sort of very aware of what it means to be um a forgotten artist in that sense and even with all of that awareness um\n[noise] I just I was upset at the idea that what would matter most about a person's life would be their work every person has a legacy you may not know what your impact is and it may not be something that you can write on your tombstone\nUm but every person has an impact on this world who\nSo let's say you were successful writer and you published your books and people run them let's say you were an amazingly successful writer and people even read them after you were dead [noise] let's say you're really\nSuccessful and people read them a hundred years later I mean you know it's like well how far are we going here [noise]\nEventually you know they're going to find your name on a credit card in the landfill [noise]\nTheir Cynthia Enron all went back to their lives back to their kids their hobbies back to their writing none of them have taken an interest and Dennis is work\nSo dances worked just sits there in the back rooms of the Internet he does have one book on Amazon the one that got published although there isn't a lot of evidence that many people have visited his page it's pretty barren no authors bio no picture\nThe only clear evidence that anyone has read his book as a single solitary review\nAs positive five stars
