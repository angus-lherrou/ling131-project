shoot other denominations they should also lead the conversations I in their own houses of worship I think\nWe're in in such a challenging difficult place that we need to have the faith leaders and civic leaders and business leaders we've come to a place where a nothing is more important in our country right now than ah this this uh opportunity to end or this hatred and violence\nAnd you know our nation as a history of violence targeting houses of worship bombings mass shootings you just mentioned the couple you think about three years ago a manual Amy and South Carolina you think about the twenty six people that were killed at the first Baptist church in rural southern springs\nWhen people are targeting houses of worship what does that say to you though because they're specifically targeting these areas where they know people probably are not carrying weapons but it's a house of worship does that speak to some deep\nIt does hatred yeah says this is the most evil kind of evil that ever is or was\nA to walk into it to a group of people praying or had to have that kind of hatred um is is the worst kind of evil and this is being prosecuted as it should as a hate crime or a so so I so I agree with that sentiment\nI Know you don't probably want to talk about security measures but even here with President Trump said that perhaps maybe if if there was armed security there it might prevent it just ... of this incident but as of as a senior rabbi at the temple you have to concern yourself with the ... and\nWe take our security very seriously and as you said we're not able to discuss it ah but um it's something that we have always taken very seriously and uh I I reject the notion that that uh someone standing with a gun that's the answer particularly because there were police officers or who did have weapons that were injured\nOr so I reject that notion and there are a or a smaller congregations all over this country that will not be able to uh to to do that so the the that's not the answer\nWhat is your message to your congregants or again to the community at large and\nYou want to be able for people to worship you want people if you have a right to feel the way they feel if they are angry if they're upset but how do you ... your rabbi and leader of your ...\nHow do you navigate through all that and your own personal feelings I mean you you you were emotionally while I'm not saying I mean back up on on projected on you\nBut you're correct which has been one of the most difficult periods\nYou've got to be ... or you also have to reconcile with whatever you dealing\nAnd we support each other we have a a a large a clergy team in our congregation and we spend time supporting each other and a pastor into each other and and caring for each other\nAnd that is true of the of the interfaith community here there are so many ministers and e moms and rabbis in Atlanta um that that are part of my inner circle really part of my family and uh and and we ...\nEach other at I think that all of us are going to share a very similar message with our communities\nThis weekend or in churches and mosques and synagogues and you'll have a visual plan is well we have a vigil planted a twelve thirty on Tuesday Afternoon and of course will be a adding special prayers of remembrance at our regular Shabaab worship this Friday evening as well\nPredatory bird we are in a political climate in elections coming up but how do you navigate through all of that and trying to stay out of the politics of it but do you get a message to your kind of gets about not just say who to vote for but\nMaybe they get a little deeper in terms of which candidate to support\nWhy I Do tell everyone to vote all the time it's it's so important that every whoever you whoever you want to vote for being every ... or so I I don't feel that it's my role to um to endorse candidates I'm I feel that it's my role as a rabbi ... to make sure everybody votes for whoever they want to vote for\nA bit be to work very strongly on the issues so what I Do is develop a relationship with political ah and civic leaders of all parties in all background so that when an issue arises um I can I have a relationship and I'm able to work with them\nUh and and I this is something that I'll be doing in the coming days is working with a members of all political parties to make sure that we address these issues of anti Semitism and gun violence\nAnd ah that are all around us and security\nAs we wrap up and I know they have you been in touch with some people up in Pittsburgh TV who he still ... what'd you say\nWe've spoken to some of the leaders of the community and Pittsburgh to offer our profound condolences\nSometimes there's very little that one can say a except to say that that we love them and we're here for them in Atlanta not just the Jewish community but Atlanta stands behind them in with them\nOr in their grief a and that we will roll up our sleeves and work everyday to create a better world for our children and our children's children\nI Can't tell you how many times and I know that you have to have seen is raising we're in a divided nation you know our nation is divided liberal can safely just playing on this\nOur obligation it's not just a role it's an obligation I'm used to uh not only\nPreach the truth and to speak truth to power to the members of our communities but it is to meet with our elected officials because we have there here and to help them a move the needle to create a better society and\nTo move the needle to create a better society DC that that is something that can happen here\nI Do it last night as the city that's too busy to hate we're the city of the civil rights movement\nOr we are a city where the

going to give people facts and you all that is your job to to track in and make sure you all have the facts\nUm I only here for the love of my people but the other side of that coin is this inherent violence of removing all people who are quote unquote white from that society\nHas you reflect on what happened this past week in in in Pittsburgh what are your thoughts\nIt's devastating I mean it's it's it's feeling a all too common in this day and age that we are that we're going\nDoes this tragedy over and over again I mean I think that just to a couple of years or what happened in Charleston and breaks my heart that you know we're continuing to see violence at the scale in this country\nYou mentioned Charleston South Carolina and then the young men Dylann Roof and then it was noted that you know here's a young man that was being infiltrated with all this information and what Nineteen twenty yeah that's so young\nWell it speaks to you know how effective this propaganda can be especially for disaffected youth I mean one of the things that's most disturbing about what we saw during Rufus he seems to have done it basically by himself on line\nAnd I you know I just want to take something to say the tech companies have to do more you know we're working to try to get them to make some policy changes um you know someone called changed the terms of basically they have to take this problem more seriously\nWhat do you mean for example if if there's someone at the at is posing with guns or\n... that would be a fantastic first start particularly if it's an a threatening manner with rhetoric but I'm Talking even out of basic level they don't seem to be able to get a handle of hate groups were have leaders even being on the platforms if you can't even deal with that explosive problem how can we even begin to deal with this kind of rising tide of toxicity that we're talking about all too often now\nHosting company may say well look we have terms they read them they they agree to the terms you know but the end of the day that they are they making money and so if someone has a website where they're paying a certain amount for you know for that site to be hosted is hosting company then saying look we've done all we can we can do so you can't hold his responsible [noise]\nYeah I mean you can you can hear that argument and you do sometimes from some of these companies but I Would turn around and say you know is there not some moral responsibility that they that they bear for hosting that content in for allowing it to be reached by all these people you know there are an essential part of how the infrastructure exists\nBut going beyond just someone posting some language or some narrative there haven't broken any laws and you understand the argument\nI can understand that argument but I also think that these companies have a responsibility to make a choice at take a stand\nEach year you all put out the hate report um and I imagine each year it hasn't changed much in terms of the the thickness of the magazine but uh how do you well\nHow do you decide if then this issue which has all these organizations in it if this issue is accurate number one and then number two that you also aren't\nGiving people information where they can find these hate groups\nWell we weigh that carefully when we write about it and you know this is where you know context and details are so important you know we spend so much time\nTracking these groups and tried to contextualize them in meaningful ways and we have a variety of audiences law enforcement among them um that we try to get this information to so that they can take it in their local communities and be aware you know I think many times a awareness is that first step and knowing that it's out there\nA senior research analyst your the person that's also helping compile all of this yes ma'am\nMa'am she can Hanks is a senior research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center thank you

tough thing to ask him thirty seconds is there any way back from this or is this just the way it's going\nYeah absolutely I mean cities are vibrant and cities have problems that can be resolved and right here in the in New York City there are people that are trying to fix this problem by\nA passion for example a city vacancy tax so landlords would have to pay a tax from keeping the space vacant

Ginsberg urged ...\nHad knocked against for ... had had two children are older daughter Maryland who died um\nWhen she was six years old and\nRuth was to ... and so see a beta poured all this energy and intelligence in to uh the upbringing of this daughter and had a profound influence and you know like so many\nJewish families during that time there was all a lot of anti Semitic narrative and and actions that was common\n... do we know her parents taught as your caller Ruth about dealing with all of that in coping with the during that time do we have a sense of that\nOne of the things that her mother I emphasized a a great deal was the functionality of anger\nAnd I think I think that to come offline in minority families not just do a ... a mutt\nAs she can remember various incidents of you know being called ... and and driving in Pennsylvania with her family and passing signs at hotels that said no dogs are Jews allowed and\nSo she was keenly aware of anti Semitism and I think her\nHer mother's emphasis on how anger was not function all was partly in response to that and a lot of her influence how to do with um\nJewish religion and that is\nMaking her daughter understand what ... Mitt repairing the world making it a better place a more just place she also taught her the meaning of ... I say DACA ... which is sharing because Ruth had\nA birthday party every march\n[noise] but they never celebrated as did her classmate her mother took her a mother and her aunt took her to a Jewish offering an orphanage in Brooklyn the pride of Judea and um ice cream bars\nShe said later that you know she would have liked in ordinary birthday party like other girls and and her school but that it was such a joy it was so nice seeing the the joy and\nHappiness if the children that she\nCould appreciate why they wanted her to do that\nHow much access did you have to her one on one to Justice Ginsburg\nWhile I did a number of of interviews I think uh [noise] six before two thousand and six and then a three after that um\nWe stopped doing\nThe interviews the year she found out that her husband's cancer had return and then resumed later on\nShe very open to the idea of you I take it she was doing this biography of her\nWell it didn't start out as a biography at all I was interested in the ACLU litigation and I went to the archives at Princeton University the seating mud library which is depository of the ACLU are ...\nAnd um I was able to get the\nCase files for this read the read breach which was full of correspondence with Ruth and I was absolutely hooked and I said ... the rest of the uh women's rights project papers\nAnd they said we don't have them um and I said sure yes we're sure the the um FBI wanted them when she became when she was nominated to the Supreme Court\nFor background checks for background we we've heard that before lately everywhere and uh they\nSaid they must still be at New York so those are very frustrating period when I was trying to figure out what had happened disease and a colleague of mine said well why don't you write to Ginsberg\nAnd ask her to help you locate [noise] and\nI got ... this letters in my mailbox that left us women see these records which was written to the ACLU\nAnd it turned out they were lost in a move between buildings in New York at the national headquarters and she said well you know she was teaching it calling me at the time and she said you know I had a record in the fall cabinet at Columbia\nAnd uh You're welcome to look at those which she had transferred to the library of Congress men stripped division\nAnd so she was happy to talk about those\nUm and she had said to me let me know if you have any questions and then one fatal lay I called up and said ah the interviews will always it's a four o'clock on friday before Labor Day\nAt the court and they could extend longer than and a\nSaid I'd like to talk next time about Flatbush\n\nWhich way she had grown up in Brooklyn yeah and she said we don't need to talk about for like Bush [noise] um\nAnd I said well I think it's important because they're I've read articles in which the differing descriptions of cancer your mother had and I mentioned a couple of other contradictory\nThings that we're in for it and I said really I think it's important to know the facts to have the facts\nStraight so she agreed to give me half an hour and I get it at that point it tend to we were working so hard to get the facts straight that I write up what I had gotten a firm that half\nHour interview which I think stretched forty five minutes and then I send it to her you know after I had to type it up so the first chapter was by far the hardest\nTo do because it took me for ever to get all the material that was the first chapter\nYou mentioned that\nWhen you read it you thought hey this is this is pretty good this is already being touted as the most comprehensive\nAnd detailed\nAccount of Justice Ruth\nBader Ginsburg do you you see it\nThat way it's okay to sometimes they know what my work is this is the truth right here it's a life it's her life\nWell it is to the extent to the extent that I could get all the sources that are needed I mean you really never know I think when you write about another person's life\nThere always things that you don't know and when you interview a justice\nWho's a custom to control um\nI can remember I can remember asking a question and if she didn't want to answer she didn't inherit and I would come back next year and in the context of other questions asked the question again usually by the third time I could get an answer\n[noise] well the book is called\nRuth Bader Ginsburg a life the authors Jane sharing the heart professor of America and history at the University of California Santa Barbara ... being to on your speaking later the Atlanta history center thank you so much for this conversation I really enjoyed it\nWell thank you\nI mean there's nobody I'd rather talk about hobbies so I I ... and you got five hundred and forty pages to back it up too much thank you [noise]\n\nWe brought her north and they told us that uh she had maybe four months left to live and we should just take her back to Haiti and let her die there um and I knew her to be a fighter and I said I'm if she's going to fight I'm going to fight and she lived nearly two years twenty three months which is very very long with the PG\nUh which is always fatal and during that time she gave us the gift of a family and ah the probably the best little story I can tell you about her is when she got towards the end than she needed to be carried everywhere and I carried her wherever you know up from the table from the bed downstairs wherever she wanted to go\nAnd we were sitting at the table one time coloring and all of us I looked at my watch a ... it was late for work and I got upset I gotta\nGo chick I'm Sorry and she said no no stay in color I said I have to go no no stake she could this is my job and she said no it's not your job is carrying me you know like that and of course\nShe was right my job my real job was carrying her as all of our job is to carry children and and the last time I held she\nUh was one I carried her after she died a in our little bed in our in our room with my wife and me right next door and we we filter final heartbeat\nLiterally go out of her body and I carried her a outside to the you know to the Hearst was waiting so carrying her was a was an honor and uh\nI'm actually working on that book now that I intended to do and that's going to come out next year I Believe in it's probably best that I waited and got the fiction kind of put it in the motions into the next person you mean heaven but I'll tell her story one day\nI'm going to get back to the book but I Want to ask you ... did you talk to her about having\nYeah she talked about having a and of course she said well first she said\nHow did you find me remember that night distinctly she was lying there and we were just kind of voting on her she was in a bit out of the blue she said how did you find me I said what do you mean how do we find you how did you um is Janine find me and\nI said you mean how did you come to us at the mission\nAnd she kind of nodded but I realized\nTo her that's probably what it felt like because she didn't really remember her mother um and it felt like she was found like she had been lost somewhere and all she really remembered was life with us and so then we started talking about you know that you would see her mother again and housing and she said well how the how you're going to know me\nAnd I said oh she'll know you why she\nDidn't see me she doesn't see me now you know she was using a seven year olds logic and I said she knows who you are and and she'll see but we never really talked to her a lot about her illness you know we we weren't people who nicknamed her tumor to me the tumor or anything like that I I Want her to be a child as long as she could and that's what we did\nIt get back to\nThe next person you meet in heaven if folks haven't read the five people you meet in heaven can they follow\nYou yeah you have to always sort of prepare for an eddy makes a a return visit or in this but it's not a prerequisite for knowing this is the story of anti ... and anti or who is eight when the accident happened uh now is grown up and she doesn't remember the accident and she has sort of traumatic\nOr you know memory where it disappeared and all she knows is that that morning she went to the museum part and that night she came back\nAnd she was injured in the accident and everything changed and from that point forward she was kind of shadow by the idea that she makes mistakes\nAnd of course she did make a mistake that day but she doesn't know why and so everything then throughout her life as she takes that point of view high school as a bunch of mistakes and relationships bunch of mistakes and they've been trying to find a job mistakes and and she just thinks she's one of those people that everything she touches goes wrong\nAnd finally she marries her childhood sweetheart and she thinks finally I did one thing right and that turns tragically wrong on their on their wedding night and she dies trying to save her husband from a balloon accident which is similar again to like the big crash and the first book in the first chapter in and\nShe goes to heaven and she meets five people one of whom of course is Eddie\nAnd Eddie is the one who really finally it illuminates for her to know this wasn't a mistake and your life was in a series of mistakes even the thing that you did with me wasn't a mistake and he kind of shows or how it all fits into the bigger picture how long it take you to write this with ...\nYou're a little over a year year and a half\nIt was easy to find that voice again once I you know I was surprised has been Fifteen Years since I wrote in that voice it's sort of a a gentle narrators voice almost tell like telling a fable or and every book has its own voice so you have to ... that's really the trick to settle into that boys\nBut it really came back to a surprise you must authors and now I Know like what are you know the jak richer writers or Harry Potter or whatever the you know they just conjure up that oh here we go again and they bring the characters back and you can have that voice return to you\nKnow when people like they tell you and you say to just write your like come on\nWell the the biggest difference having been a journalist and being a novelist is when you're a journalist or you're writing you know a true story you say boy the story would be amazing if he had a brother you know but of course she didn't so we can't\nWhen you're a novelist you say boy this to be amazing if you had a brother and he said oh I can give him a brother that's the good part the bad part is\nMaybe I should give him a sister [laughter] yeah maybe I should give them two brothers your imagination never shuts off you can always imagine another way to phrase and another thing that could happen to your characters and so at some point you have to say no\nI'm telling this story the story doesn't mean that there weren't thirty other different versions believe me of the five people than any meets in in the next person mean heaven I had like six other people that kind of\nAlmost made the cut and then you know training camp ended and they had to go uh but you know I could imagine the book with a different thirty Eric Durban but you can't do that or you'll torture yourself you never write anything\nYou recently told the Associated Press and I'm quoting here I really don't think my books are about death and I don't think they are depressing I think the opposite and that was in a reference to people like in your teens to always deal with damage or the afterlife right right\nIt's more the death part of the afterlife I don't mind but uh it's ... to that question why are you still fascinated with death\nAnd I always laugh and I say I'm not that I hate death I Want to I don't want to come visit me I don't like writing about that to me if he writes serial killer books you've got something about that every ten pages you know someone gets their throat slash their head blown off you've got to really graphically describes it my books there's usually one death that usually takes about a half a page\nAnd the rest of it in life but what I learned from Tuesdays with more\nAnd I guess I employed and everything that I have written sense is that\nWhen death is a theme or an element of your book you can get people's attention about life the reason Tuesdays with more resonated with people in terms of the lessons that more he was saying are important was because he was dying\nAnd we believe that when people really are about to die there was a wisdom to comes that is different than the wisdom when we're just walking around perfectly healthy you're able to put everything into perspective and say this matters this doesn't matter you thought this matter but now you're at the end it doesn't\nSo in each of my novels there's usually a debt that also kind of gets you into that year like a white well but that that's happened and the nice things must have been important and I can talk about those themes\nLike in the first one that there is no such thing as a nobody and then he finds that out when at the end of his life in this book that there's no such thing as mistake after mistake after mistake that your mistakes open opportunities for you to do good\nWell yeah I could just write that but it's a bromide when you're right it it just sounds like a self help thing but when you write a story about somebody who died and die thinking that they were a mistake and then finds out that they weren't now it's a story with a lesson now it's a fable that's what a fable isn't so\nThat's the only reason that there's a death in my books it's ... to go\nOkay you got your attention now All right now we'll\nWe're going to talk about life so you're not Mitch out on the death writer no [laughter] I Do not wear a shroud I ah I don't live in a cemetery and I know I Hope to hype of the thumb blessed that I can live a long life and I want that for everybody around me do you read reviews of your books which\nLong ago gave up on that I understood I understand the review world and and uh\nYou know being a journalist I have had friends who have done reviews and all the rest and I know that also being a journalist is probably hard for other journalists to write about a journalist who's writing novels I think right off the bat you're you're almost got to strike against you but but I don't read good ones or bad ones and you know sometimes people come up and tell me about something\nThat I you know as if they thought I read it but for the most part\nI ah I very much I'm a writer who connect with those readers and I do read their letters and notes and that takes up all the available time I have because they're very passionate and frequently there about their own heartbreaks yeah and you can't just\nYou know I always said being a journalist yourself you appreciate this when I was a sports writer [noise]\nPeople would stop me an airport since I recognize me from the sports reporters TV show that I was on and and they what you know the guy beyond the moving sidewalk and they'd be on the movie\nAnd they say hey sports reporter is a a who's going to the super bowl and you'd go patriots and you just keep going\nThen after Tuesdays with Dorie and ever since then people will recognize me and they say hey I'm my

kids are coming out of college those that were coming out of college they don't know about what it means now to wake up and be a millionaire [noise]\nThey don't know certain life skills and said you have to say if you're going to be a coach and he said red Auerbach told them that if you're going to be ... you have to be willing to be a father figure sometimes\nAbsolutely I worked with Kenny uh Turner off yeah you know and he literally understood and could connect to these players and it's important you know I Want ...\nPlaying for the hawks to mean something in the NBA community and not for what you earn but for what you do and being connected to a community I'm a native land and and my motivation for being here was community what I\nYou know have been very very fortunate that I've been able to work in a fairly significant jobs with really nice companies in Atlanta\nBut sports can galvanize the community sports can bring a community together better than any politician or policy so when you do it right which we haven't quite gotten there yet but we're making strides you you're a community asset and you touch people's lives in the most positive way\nAnd speaking of a positive way you all have a pretty fancy renovated arena that's pretty positive now the state farm arena hundred Ninety two million dollar transformation in what is this high definition video that you all say will enhance the endgame experience so wedded my flat screen ow ow you killed your [laughter]\nI um I just came from the arena to come here and whoa\nWe live in a world of screens yes me too you know we grew up looking at a TV screen and it was static and it didn't have anything but three or four channels and then it became the explosion of cable and so when the architects came to us they brought us is very unusual\nSchool idea that we wouldn't have a center hunger scoreboard that we'd have for video pavilions one in each corner so people could look to the writer they're left and have a great deal\nAnd we said that's really interesting we need to think about it 'cause when you do something that's so non traditional you're taking a risk and in the middle of the night and it was obvious\nOne of the reasons we had to renovate are building 'cause there was a risk we had all the premium on one side in a city that the best part of it as inclusion and diversity we had a division you can't come over here you don't have a ticket and so we said\nLet's do this let's keep the for video pavilions and let's add and incredible scoreboard in the middle and that's what we did so we have more a video screen square footage pixels which a lot of people don't understand I Can't tell you I'm One of them who do than any other building in the NBA\nAnd so you're telling me Steve calling and writing a closer look that regardless of the the ... that the price of your ticket when you come into this new State Farm arena you will get an experience just maybe you won't get anywhere else in the in the NBA because you have all these screens going to make it\nAbsolutely right there on the court is the first of all we have seven rose off the upper deck to make that a better experience we built a new upper deck the chick fillet fans on\nThat um I think is one of the highlights of the building and and we wanted to celebrate Atlanta when we did this building so we um we're the first NBA arena may probably the first sports arena\nThat we got with killer Mike and we built a sweatshop we have a barber shop swag shave wash and groom overlooking the court for terrorists can get your hair cut and watch the game\nI get a said watch the gaps in our minds to\nAtlanta the barber shop poachers a huge part of China\nMy first job as a kid was delivering Barbara beauty supplies as a twelve year old with a guy who had a business every Saturday I'd go run around with them and put stuff in the boxes and there was all going downtown and to to urban areas and the barber shop\nI learned also at Turner and the beauty salons when we marketed it TBS Tyler Perry show how influential on how important that piece was so we wanted something in the arena that symbolized\nAbout big piece of that line and we also wanted to celebrate the music component with killer Mike and then we built a twenty thousand square foot unbelievable restaurant bar with Atlantis background that will be in our concert north ends on\nWith all these with this upgrade and that's clear this because you know they're always rumors without the upgrade was this franchise looking to relocate and all you know you guys for the knife largest city in America we want to leave and large list the Braves went up the street so that they didn't leave Atlanta around me that they know\nTechnically they did yeah would we um you know I mean it just never was on\nBecause you see this connection with Atlanta\nAtlanta is one of the great NBA markets my job to make it a great Elana hawks margin every morning when I Would get ratings from NBA on TNT mine was the top five marketing and its income grew in how do we love\nThe NBA but not all of our home team and part of it it's nobody's from here [laughter] that's part of it is they weren't part of the community for the last fifty years and part of it was that people didn't have faith an ownership that prove themselves out it's not worth ... being trustworthy and those days are changing\nOnly professional team as you know goes beyond what you present on the field um and you know that the leagues have had to adjust because listen fan habits change so if you could what would you change anything about the NBA that you think as a ... that they need to adjust to let it relates to the fan habits [laughter] well it's\nThe building we just built as the next generation building the idea of coming and getting to ... feet having ... you know a hotdog served you in an aluminum foil wrapper with a watered down beer or soft drink something happened today and so\nThe NBA I made a big big social media investment different than other sports and we let you can basically watch a game on Twitter you really can and we let that happen because we grew the base\nBruce the fans rather than holding on to all the media because we wanted to make a dime and so I think the NBA has done a lot of things that said I Would be shocked in ten years if baseball there and have shorter games and if we didn't have shorter games\nPeriod in eighty two season\nNow for set of forty eight minutes maybe forty really I wouldn't be surprised ... forty minutes\nIn your fans of say well listen I'm I'm paying top dollar I hate the guys I and you know even though I didn't see our sweat now let's see but it's not like for ten minutes then\nAgain I'm hypothesize [laughter] and I will tell you in forty minutes he's still sweat [laughter] actually the stars could play more yeah\nSpeaking of than habits four years ago when you were brought into this role it was a terrible time for them ... listens really clear and then maybe deservedly so\nWith the\nAnytime race or racism is brought into any environment any space\nWhat was your approach and trying to maneuver through all of that because it was ugly\nWell I was here six weeks\nIf I had no history if I would've known for the state attorney and been really apple of course [laughter] and you know at its core was some out of touch people trying to hurt each other at its core\nThat really believed and didn't understand that land and that's the big piece here if you understand this city nobody scares any body nobody keeps anybody it's the best one were altogether\nForty six percent of our ticket buyers for the Atlanta Hawks are African American ... the number two team in the league is the Washington Wizards at nine percent so that's the different that's a different wow so you celebrate who we are\nYou promote who we are and you create inclusion and comfort and you you\nDo everything you can to embrace communities and that's what we've done we've invested in communities we've connected one of the first things I did was um three of our top seven executives are African American women with Keith title which didn't exist in doesn't exist in sports\nAnd it was about having diversity of thought diversity of gender and more importantly we need to represent the city that we were on our test\nDiversity and inclusion are great\nAnd I I'm just coming off listening to the Angela Davis gave a lecture and she says when it was very interesting she said you know diversity and inclusion is great but\nI go to the game to see you remember that moment when Moroccan Michelle Nunn a kid I Lived for those kind of moments the sports I Can't I don't like to know can we bring feedback and am I going to be on the folks don't even know why\nBut I'm not going to be that people anybody who's nosy if you were here you would see that rose rocks out to the music they got what I'm hearing of your music and Lois does the same thing

fact\nTwo new polls from the University of Virginia's Center for politics it shows close races in two high profile open seats southern contests a tendency Senate race and George's gubernatorial race between sector of state Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams\nNow according to the ... it's just UVA Center for politics poll camp neighbors are basically tied with camp at forty seven percent in ... that forty six percent now this online poll was conducted in English from October forth to the eleventh and respond it's we're likely Georgia voters some other findings the top issues for Georgia voters\nHealthcare come in at Seventeen percent and the economy at sixteen percent and according to the polls relates to healthcare\nForty three percent of those likely voters feel that Abrams as the better policy as opposed to thirty eight percent for Kim they're more numbers for immigration forty six percent field at camp as a better policy compared to thirty six percent filled it\nIt was at a better policy you falling all these numbers folks and among those likely Georgia voters fifty one percent say they approve the way president Donald Trump is handling his job well forty eight percent say they disapprove\nClasses for the year just put up some extra ones the other week and they are already failed so\nPeople realize that this is really worthwhile and and that they want to to do this work and so that that\nUh reconstructing the work started are getting us notoriety around the country and before I knew it people were calling me from all over the place where people come in here from Chicago in from New Orleans from the Episcopal communities saying help\nUs figure out how to get out of work going with more life\nAnd so who are the participants in the workshop are they mostly people face from within the Episcopal community\nAnybody who's a leader in the Episcopal Church so and priests and deacons have cannot be ordained until they've taken this work\nAnd they get a great like no no they just get credit for having done it and that ... that can make gave me a sea [laughter] no they don't get grades it's it's not great but um [noise]\nSo anybody who is some of that street member which is the leaders of the way our church leadership works or if you're on a search committee really if you're a Sunday school teacher if your parents administrators any job that you have that's considered to be leadership you are supposed to take\nThis Maryland racism class because the idea was to get the leaders\nUp to speed so they can then I'll get the parishes up to speed and\nSo so our focus I mean we're ... our focus as it appears couple constituency but we've had people come\nFrom the Methodist Church we've had a high people come we have had an atheist come to our classes because they've heard about the classes and they wanted to come and we don't we're not going to turn anybody away so anybody who wants to come as welcome but we don't promote the work\nOutside of our own constituency because we have fifty six thousand Episcopalian in Atlanta so I used to tell the commission that's a big enough constituency for me if we can impact that group I'll be happy the commission morphed into the center because we outgrew being a commission\nWe were doing all this work all over the country and just a little group of volunteers\nAnd so the bishops said you know you all of outgrown being a commission and I said you know you're right we have and I was just I was falling tearing I I was not being paid nobody was being paid would end and I was working like forty fifty hours a week as a volunteer\nSo because I was a retired and knew what to do I could do it but you cannot expect volunteers to be the the to get this work done not the way it really needs to be done so I when the bishops said um\nHe thought we had outgrown ourselves I said you're right and so then I wrote to the presiding bishop bishop curry and sad\nWe want to start a center would you be interested in supporting that and he said he was and so we are now not just for Atlanta but the center for the whole church which is all of the United states and eleven countries [noise]\nAnd so if I had any sense I Would not have taken the job because that's a huge amount of of a responsibility but I feel like that you just take a step at a time and you just go forward so the work is we've already work now\nAll the way to Honduras which is a province nine in our church the Latin America in Providence\nAnd I was just in Honduras a month ago working with folks there and then across the country of working with people in Iowa and Tennessee in Texas I just all over\nAnd so it and it's just you know it's one phone call one workshop one speech one conversation at a time and it doesn't matter whether it's hero in Honduras but I looked at our scope and in one year\nWe can we mapped out ourselves and we are working here in the diocese we're working in the southeast which is our province for they were working nationally because we're in all these other dioceses across the country and internationally in Honduras and also in Guyana we are\nOur diocese is uh is has a sister relationship with K.C Cole scanner so we will be doing some\nWe've had people go and they are already on pilgrimages but we'll be doing some work with Canadians as well so I'm pretty excited about that and you know to be to be this retired African American studies professor who did this work for\nAll these years into now have this chance to be here and bring those skills and that passion and and sets of intention allergic to this work\nUnder this umbrella is a real gift\nYou do a lot of work with faith leaders mhm I'm curious what questions are one of those familiar questions that you get from them\nHandling maneuvering navigating through the racism space when it intersects with I once religion or one's faith and you're a leader mhm what do they want well\nOne thing people say to be more than I Wish I Would hear is how hard it is to have a conversation about race and I just want to say yeah but you know\nYou just have to start and so we actually host conversations on race where we've set up panels and and help people see how you can do that because it's a matter of having the courage to do it first of all\nSo um the other thing that comes up a lot as we don't know what to do\nYou know here we are and we know that the church is not where it needs to be and we know racism is running rampant all over the place and we just don't know what to do\nAnd I I Try to help people refrain refrain that question it's not that you don't know what to do is that you don't have the courage to do what you do know you need to do because it's not it doesn't take long to figure out that racism is wrong\nAnd and that the church if anywhere there's inequity we need to be speaking to it now you have to decide if you have the courage to do it and be willing to suffer whatever the consequences are so if you were a priest and you end up on Sunday Morning and preach about\nThe inequities and the the wrongness of racism they're going to be people in the few who don't like it and they're going to be people who start paying their pledges then who go to some other church where they don't have to hear that kind of a sermon so that's those are the for me that's really the bigger bigger issue and so\nI hear behind many of those kinds of questions are laments I hear an issue about courage about you know I'm I'm\nI Do this really you're asking do I have the courage to go on this journey the way I Need to because now you're beginning to see is a journey to go on and what do I have the courage to do it so one of the things we've done here\nIs invited people from around the country to come to Atlanta and let's have a conversation about what are you doing what do you wish you were doing how things\nGoing what kind of community of support do you have because it's hard to stand up and take back the kind of risk that needs to be taken if you don't feel like there is anybody going on a journey with you and so some of these some of our people are out in\nYou know a little church way out somewhere in South Georgia and the the priest is going to stand up on Sunday Sunday morning and talk about racism and everybody in the room is white and nobody wants to hear it it takes some it takes a little more than just thinking that's a good thing to do I mean you need a community of support\nAnd you need to have come to terms with\nWhat it is what it is you feel how to do and how do you want to live that call out and so I think that um [noise]\nI I'm we're offering a service to help people feel emboldened to to tell the truth\nAnd that's what that's what I hear a lot from like all over the country in the back of the question of I don't know what to do or what do we do how do we start a conversation is how do I do this work can survive\nYou know how do I do this work and get to stay a priest or a deacon or keep my job and you know because I Know I Know church people they they don't like what they don't like something they ... the first thing they do is could given their money\nAnd then if you get enough of them doing that it affects everything and then they go somewhere else because they can you know we there are a lot of folks who think these\nIf you go somewhere else you can find a different message I don't know what Jesus they have in mind 'cause the last time I checked there was the same went everywhere but they seem to think there's you know across town you could get a different version of Jesus and maybe you can but I just feel like that that is a fear\nOr underneath the the most of the questions that come\nGiven the current political space where in one might want to counter that political space has been spring a lot of tension discourse in our nation\nI see the role of faith leaders and we're going to know the intersection politics mhm\nYou know if you think about you have you have to think about who what what is it that you're saying you believe in and Jesus was really\nOut there on the cutting edge speaking about wrong and calling\nPower into question and I think that's part of the job of fake they failed person or person trying to be on a fake Germany period I don't care what your faith is that you have a responsibility to not just acquiesce to the culture\nAnd right now we have a whole lot of people who just walking on the fleet so they're willing to agree to whatever is is bad so and let me just say quickly that if folks want to come on November second\nThe event starts at nine thirty here at the center and they need to go to the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta's website to register and registration is limited so powerful day indeed\nYes Dr Katherine ... thank you so much for taking the time thank you for inviting closer look to the center thank you for coming thank you [noise]\n\n\n\nDo you want

everybody get ready let's say\nMm\nI mean I'm a friend now where they knew\nKnow I'm In a\nMatter of first time you're saying that I'm thinking that might have been a good wedding song [laughter] [laughter] it was a lot we are a whole new world joining me now in Studio is Mr people's rights and welcome back good to see you just said you know when this hits you know when you're courting that do this is going to be yeah I I think there's\nSomething in you that tells you the first time new viewer song before what you've been recorded um when you know what it is the first time you hear it sometimes you don't know until you've actually recorded it but sometimes you you know even before then some things have um [noise]\nI I think this it's kind of like the difference between a great book list and annoyed book list oh I'm great music and anointed music and there's a there's a difference once one has a bulletin kind of some now that only six to solve\nAny so every so thanks and that's what it speaks to that's it's only the ... primary mandate\nAnd it must be really clear when you when you're singing a song for like a feature film you know when Harry Met Sally away in a race but then it's an animation is it is it is it a little tougher because of like oh you know I'm thinking about the cartoons you\nThis to be honest I'm these songs don't come with Disney sounds don't come with like a [noise]\nA manual you know so that we it's whatever you you give it they don't have a music people around that actually there is no suggestion and how you approach it yeah you know it's if you have to have something to give it you have to make it yours\nSo that when you're doing the Disney song of the first one was ...\nI had never met we'd never met we met in the studio a wow are but I had a great to sing something with her long before that um we were label mates at Columbia mhm and I just want to ask me my my aunt or person asked me if I Would be interest that I knew ...\nI said sure she's amazing instrument and he said well you know how would you like to sing something with that so I'd love to we didn't have a song and his association because his father is was held land as it was like king of the B movies in the band it and all that through his association with film\nHe got a chance to see the new animation or and so we're looking at what is it while is terrific some the wouldn't just wondering is there any music and they said funny you should ask [laughter]\nSo so but when you ... what is it there is no it doesn't come with instructions you you look at it do you look at a thing as first\nYou have to go mark Israeli is what is the thing in another itself with ... sure it is a an object lesson to all children around the globe to look past the physical in order to find true beauty and anything so if there's a bit of lesson to learn if", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Closer Look with Rose Scott", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "17", "locations": [["East Point",

edition of closer look I'm Rose Scott we'll begin with is yet another poll has been released in fact\nTwo new polls from the University of Virginia's Center for politics\nIt shows close races in two high profile open seats southern contests a tendency Senate race in Georgia's gubernatorial race between secretary of state Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams\nNow according to the ... it's just UVA Center for politics poll camp and aprons are basically tied with camp at forty seven percent in ... that forty six percent now this online poll was conducted in English from October forth to the eleventh\nAnd respond it's we're likely Georgia voters some other findings the top issues for Georgia voters\nHealthcare come in at Seventeen percent and the economy at sixteen percent and according to the polls relates to health care forty two percent of those likely voters feel that Abrams has a better policy as opposed to thirty eight percent for Kim\nThey're more numbers for immigration forty six percent field at camp as a better policy compared to thirty six percent feel that ...\nPolicy you falling all these numbers folks and among those likely Georgia voters fifty one percent say they approve the way president Donald Trump is handling his job well forty eight percent say they disapprove\nWork and reform adding in and kind of putting and underneath this larger umbrella really and live in the work and and started people stopped trying to avoid it and started being interested in taking classes now our classes fill up and like\nNo time and we put up our classes for the year just put up some extra ones the other week and they are already failed so\nPeople realize that this is really worthwhile and and that they want\nTo to do this work and so that that\nUh reconstructing the work started are getting us notoriety around the country and before I knew it people were calling me from all over the place where people come in here from Chicago in from New Orleans from the Episcopal communities saying help\nUs figure out how to get out of work going with more life\nAnd so who are the participants in the workshop are they mostly people safe from within the Episcopal community\nAnybody who's a leader in the Episcopal Church so and priests and deacons have cannot be ordained until they've taken this work\nAnd they get a great like no no they just get credit for having done it and that if it actually makes gave me a sea [laughter] no they don't get grades it's it's not great but um [noise]\nSo anybody who is on a vest remember which is the leaders of the way our church leadership works or if you're on a search committee really if you're a Sunday school teacher if you're a parish administrator any\nJob that you have that's considered to be leadership you are supposed to take this Maryland racism class because the idea was to get the leaders up to speed so they can and um get the parishes up to speed\nAnd so so our focus I mean we're pits aliens our focus is it a ... couple constituency but we've had people come\nFrom the Methodist Church we've had a high people come we have had atheists come to our classes because they've heard about the classes and they wanted to come and we don't we're not going to turn anybody away so anybody who wants to come as welcome but we don't promote the work\nOutside of our own constituency because they had fifty six thousand Episcopalian in Atlanta so I used to tell the commission that's a big enough constituency for me if we can impact that group I'll be happy the commission morphed into the center because we outgrew being a commission\nWe were doing all this work all over the country and just a little group of volunteers and so\nThe bishops said you know you all of outgrown being a commission and I said you know you're right we have and I was just I was falling tearing I I was not being paid nobody was being paid would end and I was working like forty fifty hours a week as a volunteer\nSo because I was retired and knew what to do I could do it but you cannot expect volunteers to be the the to get this work\nAnd not the way it really needs to be done so I when the bishops said um\nHe thought we had outgrown ourselves I said you're right and so then I wrote to the presiding bishop bishop curry and said we want to start a center would you be interested in supporting that and he said he was\nAnd so we are now not just for Atlanta but the center for the whole church which is all of the United states and eleven countries [noise]\nAnd so if I had any sense I Would not have taken this job because that's a huge amount of of a responsibility but I feel like that you just take a step at a time and you just go forward so the work is we've already work now\nAll the way to Honduras which is province nine in our church the Latin America and province\nAnd I was just in Honduras a month ago working with folks there and then across the country and working with people in Iowa and Tennessee in Texas I just all over\nAnd so it and it's just you know it's one phone call one workshop one speech one conversation at a time and it doesn't matter whether it's here or in Honduras but I looked at our scope and\nIn one year we can we mapped out ourselves than we are working here in the diocese we're working in the southeast which is our province for they were working nationally because we're in all these other dioceses across the country and internationally in Honduras\nAnd also in Guyana we are our\nDiocese is uh is has a sister relationship with Cape ... so we will be doing some\nWe've had people go and they are radio pilgrimages but we'll be doing some work with ... as well so I'm pretty excited about that and you know to be to be this retired African American studies professor who did this work for\nAll these years and now have this chance to be here and bring those skills and that passion and and sense of intention allergic to this work under this umbrella is a real gift\nYou do a lot of work with faith leaders mhm I'm curious what questions are what are those familiar questions that you get from them\nHandily maneuvering navigating through the racism space when it intersects with I once religion or one safe and you're a leader mhm what do they want\nWell one thing people say to be more than I Wish I Would hear is how hard it is to have a conversation about race and I just want to say yeah but you know\nYou just have to start and so we actually host conversations on race where we've set up panels and and help people see how you can do that because it's a matter of\nHaving the courage to do it first of all so um the other thing that comes up a lot as we don't know what to do\nYou know here we are and we know that the church is not where it needs to be and we know racism is running rampant all over the place and we just don't know what to do and I\nI Try to help people refrain refrain that question it's not that you don't know what to do is that you don't have the courage to do what you do know you need to do\nBecause it's not it doesn't take long to figure out that racism is wrong\nAnd and that the church if anywhere there's an equity we need to be speaking to it now you have to decide if you have the courage to do it and be willing to suffer whatever the consequences are so if you were a priest and you end up on Sunday Morning and preach about\nThe inequities and the the wrongness of racism they're going to be people in the few who don't like it and they're going to be people who stopped paying their pledges then who go to some of the church where they don't have to hear that kind of sermon so that's those are the for me that's really the bigger bigger issue and so\nBy here behind many of those kinds of questions are laments I hear an issue about courage about you know I'm I'm\nI Do this really you're asking do I have the courage to go on this journey the way I Need to because now you're beginning to see is a journey to go on\nAnd but do I have the courage to do it so one of the things we've done here is invited people from around the country\nTo come to Atlanta and let's have a conversation about what are you doing what do you wish you were doing how things going what kind of community of support do you have because it's hard to stand up\nAnd take it that the kind of risk that needs to be taken if you don't feel like there is anybody going on a journey with you and so some of these some of our people are out in\nYou know a little church way out somewhere in South Georgia and the the priest is going to stand up on Sunday Sunday morning and talk about racism and everybody in the room is white and nobody wants to hear it it takes some it takes a little more than just thinking that's a good thing to do I mean you need a community of support\nAnd you need to have come to terms with\nWhat it is what it is you feel how to do and how do you want to live that call out and so I think that um\n[noise] I I'm we're offering a service to help people\nFeel emboldened to to tell the truth and that's what that's what I hear a lot from like all over the country in the back of the question of I don't know what to do or what do we do how do we start a conversation is how do I do this work and survive\nYou know how to do this work and get to stay a priest or a deacon or\nKeep my job and you know because I Know I Know church people they they don't like what they don't like something they ... the first thing they do is could given their money and then if you get enough of them doing that it affects everything and then they go somewhere else because they can you know we did a lot of folks who think these\nIf you go somewhere else you can find a different message I don't know what Jesus they have in mind 'cause last time I checked there was the same one everywhere but they seem to think there's you know across town you can get a different version of Jesus and maybe you can but I just feel like that that is a fear\nOr underneath the the most of the questions that come\nGiven the current political space where in one might want to counter that political space has been spring a lot of tension discourse in our nation\nI see the role of faith leaders and we're going to know the intersection politics mhm\nYou know if you think about you have you have to think about who what what is it that you're saying you believe in and Jesus was really\nOut there on the cutting edge speaking about wrong and calling\nThen you because that's how you begin to build courage you know you you've got to enter thing that makes you stand against injustice I mean that's that's what I that's a piece of wood healing is about that no I can no longer tolerate injustice because there's nothing in me that will agree to it and\nRight now we have a whole lot of people who just walking along the fleet so they're willing to agree to whatever is is bad so and let me just say ...\nPlay that folks want to come on November second the event starts at nine thirty here at the center and they need to go to the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta's website to register and registration is limited\nSo powerful day indeed yes Dr Catherine make thank you so much for taking the time thank you for inviting closer look to the center thank you for coming thank you [noise] um\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to sing dance [noise] I don't think he wants to hear that there's a reason we're playing it because you know everybody got a part of what the ... the man who you are seen bringing up Jake\nWhere were you know everybody\nTried to sing the song and it was everybody's wedding song [laughter] coming up with\nJust a moment we're going to have a fun conversation with the legendary people Bryson but until then we're going to celebrate the fact that we are in our fault membership pledge drive and your support matter so much to us to all the listeners six seven eight\nFive five three Ninety nine year on line and WABC dot org and Jan Barry joins me and jammed before we started seeing it's not I celebrate my love you're a ... another conversation\nA conversation it's not always easy conversations about race but we'll be able to go beyond just conversation about race and racism so talking to Dr Katherine makes about\nRacial healing mhm it's a conversation that people are rarely talk about yeah give me uncomfortable yeah but it's the next steps the next step right so having those conversations with what we do here yeah I think it it's\nThis whole show both segments out that um the conversation you just had and then when you have coming up are so indicative of the ...\nThat you cover on this show and that you go deep on things you have conversations that are hard to have you have conversations that are fun to have\n'em and it's that range that I think makes people like myself and like so many of our listeners love and support that show and to help they continue please don't actually support the shell by Clinton W ... dot org or calling six seven eight five five to eight Ninety Ninety I think our\nGoals for the hours Twenty one place and it's when you run and we're halfway there and if you don't pledge people Bryson's gonna retire\nAs soon as you know vice funny about racism though it's a different reality for this generation to generation that have to endure it now it's a different kind of racism that's absolutely a it's a it's it's odd that I mean\nA racism it has to have a has to be fueled by something yes you know and and but it's not inherit joined nature or to the nature of human beings and and this is what I found him I'm old enough to have been born in segregation and this\nIs totally different I like my racism straight up with no chaser\nNow we're doing a lot of what else do we want to talk about all that\nSo in conversations like and I'm so honored to have Mr Bryson here he says the calling people but you know I'm very hard we're going to have we're never going

to pass the time\nTo rise up so early in the mall and\nThe guy in a\n\nA\nYou know and would you go die was you know why don't you\nKnow come on\nI\n\n\nBut for freelancers they just don't have that something that is just like a regular illness that gets bad and you just need to rest you break your leg and you just need to not put weight on it shouldn't be a big problem\nIt should just be a problem but what happens is people go right into bankruptcy they go into credit card debt and that's why we said we need to start something that after one week of being sick or injured you get fifty percent of your income\nFor up to twelve weeks and you'd think that that would exist right didn't just doesn't sound that hard but freelancers don't have it and they're really exposed\nEconomically without it and it starts at eleven dollars a month and so what we did is we said let's be entrepreneurial let's stick together let's have some solidarity let's build this together and so what we found in Georgia is that we've already put together a great group\nOf advisers who are in our new economy collective\n... and we've been getting together for lunch and people are welcome to join us at ... dot com come sign up\nAnd we have lunch and talk and build and strategize about how we start to build the safety net in Atlanta and of course one thing I've learned as a Brooklyn I coming to Atlanta that you always have to say parking is free and that's very interesting cultural difference\nLet's talk about troop ... let's be specific because this is what we call freelance insurance now covers injuries and accidents what exactly are we talking about a year\nYeah so uh let me just say first that ... has a disability plan and with our partner or Ga we provide a very short term disability so that let's say you have you've broken your leg and you are a massage therapist and you can't put weight on it\nYou can't work what if you work with your hands and you break your arm what if you have that kind of pneumonia that gets so bad you can't take your laptop into bed with you and work which is why I freelancers do way too often and so those are the kinds of things that are covered\nIt's the unexpected things that hit people which is why you want to ensure\nGeorgia as one of the I guess the the first market for years since\nI think George is one of the most exciting freelancer places in the country there are just so many new emerging fields from film and television creative technology to having the big headquarters of\nCoke and FedEx and all these big companies are using freelancers and\nIt's just a place that's really affordable\nCreative they are moving there from the coasts in record numbers and I really think that when you spend a lot of time with freelancers they're kind of the ultimate crafts\nPeople they really are about excellence and the culture that they create is uh I I find one of the most exciting ones in in the country and not just exciting but solid ... if you couldn't believe that people have to rely on each other to do well\nAnd so freelancers teach us these lessons about taking care of one another and coming together and in Georgia this is this is the place this is like the ... Center for it\nWell let's talk about the true bowl in terms of you are making sure you have your you know you started freelancers union so now you're offered this short term disability so let's talk about\nTroop all in terms of making sure you are including everything that a freelancer might need in that short term disability who some of the consultants who are you working with and and you know to make sure that\nThis is just like any other short term disability we see the commercials with the little duck\nYou know you know so\nThat that's a great question so let me just say first of all this doesn't exist anywhere you you actually can't get that there is a longer term disability that others can getting typically they get it through their job that this is really saying freelancers face a very short term risk\nSo we the team at who uh came from the freelancers union were season we've built\nInsurance companies before we work with the top actuaries in the country\nAnd we work with our Ga our partner and their actuaries and so we have built a product\nThat is designed around freelancers as every freelancer knows one of the worst moments is interacting with insurance and finance 'cause you're made to feel weird well that's really about it too [laughter] that's true right\nAh but what is what we've tried to do is at ... dot com and it's spelled T R U P oh is that you come on it's a really easy process designed around people who have episodic income\nAnd we know that that's the hardest thing for freelancer so we said hey we know that's a problem we know your income goes up and down you have terrible dry spells and that's a good year rate\nBut what we've done is said during those periods we're going to have an affordable plan\nYou pay that monthly and then if something like this happens it covers you after one week and it will pay you fifty percent of your earning so you can pay your rent you can pay groceries just to keep you going so you can get back to work which is what freelancers want to do\nThe voice you here's Sara Horowitz she's the founder of the freelancers union but now we're talking about truthful and ensure it's an inch so I called it an insurance product a short term disability product is that a good way of the year for freelance workers and it was recently launched here in Georgia nicer I Want to ask\nYou about also mental health did you do you have a desert is a component of this plan and also covers mental health\nYes yes so it's if you think about it as\nIt's not for like the regular problems or like you know I'm tired and I want to take a paid week off or I see my therapist once a week it's really designed if you have a a serious mental health incident that as cover what about\nAn overdose\nOr in the face of opioids and you know prescription medicines\nDoes this play out in okay it's when so what what happens is if something happens you go to your health professional a doctor or a physician's assistant a nurse practitioner and they have to verify that this is happening and then that's the kind of thing that's covered\nAnd so like insurance you know if you think about like a hurricane insurance it's designed for that\nThat situation that can happen to you and you want to protect your assets so it's income protection so that you don't end up bankrupt\nEarn credit card debt or wearing and you know what I found with freelancers as we all know that you're told you put forty cents in a checking account and sixty cents and your savings account to pay for your taxes and your benefits so people know that\nAlready saving like three hundred dollars a month for these kinds of emergencies or they worry that they should\nAnd when we come together and insurance it means you don't have to save that much you just have to have the premium so that if that\nHappens you're covered and then you have the extra money that maybe you should put in your retirement or saving up for um a down payment on something\nAnd so what we're really talking about it to pose is how do you build your safety net ... personally and then you start to build that together and that's why we love to have people come and join us at ...\nFor lunches let's be clear though about some some some conditions or you know we lack of better were some things that aren't covered planned eve plans leaving pregnancy that is not covered correct\nYeah so what uh is covered typically in a longer term disability would be maternity or or the ... the ability to to go when you're when you're pregnant 'cause this is designed around one week to twelve week so that wouldn't be covered\nA regular mental health visits for therapy wouldn't be covered\nI'm a plastic surgery or elective surgery would not be covered it's really the bigger emergencies and your uh in your life and I went to an end and you can go through that it if you go to ... dot com you can see what's covered and what is your party clearly\nBecause you'll have something you you cite is dangerous behavior\nHow would you define it like you know if you are a\nI don't know you you teach sky diving [laughter] what would I what do you consider do you mean give me an example of dangerous behavior\nYeah I mean I think it's something that is just that puts yourself regularly and in harm's way like that would be an example and a sport or in a it's something that you would choose to do and like\nIt or a magicians assistant and where he you know takes the blades and puts you in half\nAn hour stuff ... by assuming let's say you're a magician didn't didn't know know how to do that one but sword swallowing might come\nTo mind it's you know it it sounds you know we're I'm laughing but people should know you know be very exact in terms of because when I hear this segment\nYou know you have a lot of people that will want to know more so getting information out as important I Want to end up doing because as you said look\nTwenty twenty seven the majority of workers will be in this freelancer this gig economy as your as we call it so by the time I imagine you might have some some competition to UC your model other companies picking it up you ready to

H. B. E. Atlanta choice for NPR I'm Rose Scott you know there's a reason why we're playing that that version that instrumental will get that in a moment because for every Ron well there's a reason right so we're going to go back to Sunday may for two thousand and eight\nMile belonged to read for those of you who are younger and don't know the old school you know the\nWords of this race philosopher and mistake that says mother mother there too many of you crying ... brother brother brother Jeff fall too many of you dying you know we've got to find a way\nTo bring some love and you know today that's\nAll the fall though we don't need to escalate for war is not the end so\nThe only love can conquer hate\nThat is the Reverend Dr Dwight Andrew delivering a Sunday sermon like he has for so many times that first congressional church here in Atlanta since Nineteen Ninety nine to be exact however\nRuben Andrews is celebrating and being celebrated as he reaches forty years of ministry and mission\nSo we turned today's conversation to religion fate politics and the journey of the river in Dr ... white Andrews welcome sir it's great to be with you and what a wonderful piece to begin with I said man get revenue using Marvin Gaye and service\nAll right that's Marvin is a he is the philosopher yeah well as the domestic and really in in some way to kind of profit\nRight now I'm In the music that he spoke to really twenty five thirty years ago was describing right where we are still resonates day\nNow want to clear some up because of that land folks have rumors you are not retiring oh no I'm just celebrate need for for decades right\nThat's right I mean not dead yet I still got a few more decades ago but\nWe're celebrating this as a time when I look back over the last forty years\nAnd I was ordained on Martin Luther king's birthday January Fifteen Nineteen Seventy eight\nSo we just thought this would be a perfect time to celebrate these first for decades or and also to commemorate Dr King and his vision for the love community and really to begin the next chapter first congregation of church save just celebrate a hundred and fifty years on the the oldest black church second\nIn the in congressional in the nation correct that's right\nSecond congregation will church second oldest exactly\nIn that clip that I played a Reverend because you went on to talk about the role of the black church and and that's why I like to begin our conversation because as you mentioned your again in Nineteen Seventy eight you see then and now is that the black church that rule the same as it evolved is it involving has not evolved enough\nI think that the the St potential existed in Nineteen Seventy eight that exist today but I think for black churches we have the struggle of being relevant and being kind of self critical of where we are and how we're doing\nAnd in many ways I think that this is a difficult in sad time because I don't think to black churches responded as well as they could to the really difficult challenges of the day you know it's it was easier when people would say whites only a and so the issues of segregation and\nThe kinds of oppression that we're really in a parent\nOr now much more um subverted and so I think our challenges are the same but I think we've underestimated the nature of up to challenge\nWho do you think then I don't want to say is responsible for she'll eat the black folks or any folks hold accountable is it the faith leader in the church is\nNo I don't think so and it's not to let the faith leader off the hook I think the issues that we all share a mutual responsibility to one another\nAnd in fact that's what excites me about the black church and the ideas that we're all in the struggle together and the tradition that I grew up in the congregation of tradition everyone saw themselves as a as a worker a cultural worker a spiritual worker bee\nAnd so if you think about the great leaders in our tradition like Andy young uh Andy always saw himself is really just a part of the the work and and not as the leader per se\n[noise] you know last night I moderated a conversation already MRI scan and chapel and I asked the question to the panel about the definition of moral leadership when they ask you that question how you define it\nWell I think I think a moral leadership is really a decisions in a way of processing decisions and living are based on a moral center\nAnd for many years to black church a had a moral center because they believed in social justice and witness not because it was a political idea but that's what Jesus taught to love your neighbors know strangers to share whatever is had that there might be enough\nAnd I think it's that vision that provides for the moral leaders and moral leadership the real interesting thing is that in some ways I think the leadership has been corrupted\nIf you will by um by commerce I by the president age in which a leadership has become so pragmatic so we don't think about principle\nAnd so I'm Still trying to find a way to stay on the principal because I think that's what brought me here\nWell let's talk about bringing you here because I I played some Motown era earlier and you're from the motor as they call it that's where I D and you're quite musician I'm let folks know because you were in his band called seven sounding make manual for parliament fundamentalists right you were hanging out with George Clinton\nWouldn't call here now [laughter]\nBecause you know the funny part about about those days is I thought that um that George Clinton in parliament I thought that they were really not going to ever be anything because they were just too wild\nToo far out they were wearing diapers and\nVote gains in army belts and here we are loving ship with land the mother ship was an addict but we had matching ... church and bell bottoms and so I thought we was a way forward but look [laughter] ah but they were very instructive because George I mean they really were pointing to the future\nOh man it's we could have a whole nother come yes but I Want to ask you about then we always talk about with someone has a ha moment or the call to serve in that calling inside of you was it even then president when you were in the seventh sounds and you know we're into frills bell bottoms\nI think it was a the calling was beginning and I'm In some ways it took a long time to unfold for me um it definitely started in the days that I was rehearsing was my rock and roll band and the church basement but it was really the pastor of the church was so busy doing things in the community", "show_name": "Closer Look with Rose Scott", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "18", "locations": [["Atlanta Georgia", 33.749, -84.38798],
