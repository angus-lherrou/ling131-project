goal of the foundation is to accelerate the transition to a secular economy which is an economic model\nWhich gets a smack on when our current is very lenient heightened like despised we take on the ground to make something after that and then the majority gets thrown away and plastic packaging is a great example\nWithin a secular economy you tend not straight line and you turn it into a cycle that you design economy said that waste is actually designed out you keep products materials and use for as long as possible\nAnd you also have the potential to be generate natural systems what we're doing around plastic packaging\nNever three areas it's about being rich and rich and restart as it's about eliminating the packaging we don't need it to the innovating around the packaging that we do said that it's one hundred percent recycled combustible or a usable and then the fed area to second that material once it's been designed\nIt within the system and we have over two hundred and fifty signatures that we've collected\nFor global commitment which we don't here today in\nAround shifting towards that model by twenty twenty five\n[noise] intentions are great it's the enforcement that's going to be the thing isn't it that's not going to be easy\nI intentions All right but I think intentions are important in the right direction and I think one thing that's been missing from the ... everybody innovation ... innovating sorry and the right direction what we've done is we've put together a specific\nSet of tall gets together with the organization the government to the fifties the region's no say some of the biggest companies in the world we have we reckon twenty percent of the\nPackaging world by volume signed up to the commitment already ... to ... get everyone has agreed on we don't have all the answers to how to get that yet but we do have the ... and ... and every Eighteen months will be refreshing them so this is about becoming one hundred percent responsible combustible reusable by twenty twenty five\nAnd ... the only issue which is living with the finite resources of the snow to expecting to have stories of Christmas\nWell over the last decade one very very visible example to all of us because we'll touch it we'll use something everybody understands but within a secular economy everything that place to the economy\nNeeds to be cycle so that uh the design of all plastic to be recyclable it could be anything biological it could be ... road rage that could be floating in the form of cost and it could be in the design says it fits within that biological cycle envy generates natural capital what\nWe've done at the moment seems to be separated ability to be and to be a dilemma here economy we have\nToday at from that second nature that takes us billions and yet\nI don't think you ... the founder of the MacArthur Foundation for almost so do you want to him and\nPolice of comes from the billionaire owner left the city football club ... died along with for others when his helicopter crashed sooner to taking off from the ... ... is our correspondent in that region\nSo he was one of the most wealthy man and this and this kind of fan here quite as well relatively quickly and recently um compared to some of the other find those high tycoons who dominate the economy a with a very controversial and often criticized monopoly on duty free sales and you think of how big the tourist industry is here you can imagine\nWhat a gold mine that is not allowed him to become to this packing on the wealthy off to finally his business back in Nineteen eighty nine is a very secretive mine HAMP he kept his business private his personal life private\nIt's a family run business a time when he didn't seem very much of him as as as a mosque calling for off for the profile he had back in Britain west\nThat throws the future of the coalition that's currently governing the country into does the Green Party did far better than expected so did the far right hey if the\nEvents of the state legislature for the first time addressing ... premiere of his focus group here so it's not a good result is not total defeat guard your job or\nHis son ... this evening is an evening is very mixed feelings speech suffer the painful losses which makes us humble which we take seriously it's\nUnreal ... finding is rewarded we had to election does to be the strongest holes to make sure that no government could be built against the CD you still stands today at this very moment woman we've achieved both things my dear friends\nAbout the green policies lead candidate didn't esoteric was struck a positive note he told supporters of victory fool the greens have been achieved\n... uh at this I'm Will now that I talked to people this is a fantastic thing for us the Green Party\nHas has never been to green and we can be proud of the fact that we went from being in government into an election in which we don't even want to say much trust through what we've done over the last five years the citizens of has given us\nWell we can speak now to ... who is an MP for ... you remember the ... committee on European affairs in the book whose constituency\nThanks so much need for being with us I'm pleased explain how things work in the sea do you think of the medical isn't the Gemini ... woman then what happens next\nWell I think that many of the city of voters have hoped for the last bombs that we would have to change ah and and and the party that does not mean that I'm Glad Mac or would not be able to continue her work as chancellor of Germany but\nA change in the in the position of the ... the leader would it would be seen as a renewal of the party what most of us think we we need to uh for for coming elections\nSo who takes over how does the princess begin\n[noise] well I think um [noise]\nWhat you mentioned just before that I could imagine probably will not be ... to to to to candidates are again for for the position of the leader\nOr that there will be several options we were talking a lot about on the ground come ... is secretary general of the city will and we were talking about in ... bond minister of health\nAnd I got America's Cup and that but I think that might also be person is where we which we are not looking at for the moment being maybe even from outside of the party establishment such as for it melts\nForm a faction leader of the CDC is who who than um went out of politics and is working and the economy and in banking for the moment being but who could probably return\nAnd the way the ... the CD you as most ongoing American lives lost support ... is that in your view connected almost directly with a decision in twenty Fifteen to persuade the policy has made the country to welcome a million refugees\nWas she didn't welcome a million refugees but she saw in that time that there was a humanitarian crisis from Austria to Hungary along the bottom conclude and that Germany at the duty to help those people to avoid a very difficult situation along that road\nBut nevertheless you're right the problem\nWe were the problems we're facing or so in this very moment with is hundreds of thousands of refugees are huge\nAnd a lot bigger than most of us would have thought in the beginning and I think um if you look at the results there is two movements one as to where it's the right wing I've Dave\nBoat as harmful to vote as we've lost in ... went to the hive day and the other half went to the green but those who went to the green\nThey are probably ... or send a center left wing of the city and they hope that they would uh probably see another um um well an open society also in the future and the and the coalition with the greens\nThat is a model which has worked quite well Frankfurt or is a huge open city and so I think we are in a difficult situation because we lose voters to both sides to the green for liver wrote an open decode truth society and\nFor national list of course like like the the promotes\n... thank you very much indeed a member of I'm going to medical CD you punish speak now to Judy Dempsey from Carnegie Europe\nJudy yes let's let's talk about the greens cause the idea of the make headlines because they a populist they seemed to be part of a almost global movement spot the greens did very well and deadly candidate certainly doesn't have a German name does he\nKnew he definitely has a degree of very interesting talking\nThe campaign Joan on dissent to ground on housing on begging busing issues but it's a very interesting thing about this green phenomena actually sold the very at the recent elections is that they now are holding dissenter\nGermany still has to send to ground on like some other countries like Britain for instance or Austria and in a credit to the greens and some of the votes is at the at the center has Harris nevertheless\nThe green message is quite hear voices are tired at the grand coalition in in Berlin and they even have to assume that it run its course Chris unemployment is so low on the prime minister local ... is very popular\nNevertheless the costs of the federal politics had a huge negative impact on tests at\nWhat we seem to have is a divided electorate than ah the greens doing well ah the AFC the far right let's go doing well as a whole so what's happened to dealing cut to the to the ... if you'd like the real left\nTo me that it didn't really do that that lady got six point two percent can touch high point you the last election but during the number down and they didn't think it really represent the eastern states\nBut even in the eastern part of Germany it's to a state that you're loading\nThe actual and reputation and influence of the capacity to ... D left wing parties that is the Social Democrats and you can't even called mixing anymore and the link to the ... the basis of support is being eroded by the FD maybe by the greens as well\nBut the rice that the soft rice is moving to the greens and the south you have to move to green says that\nThe ... the ... fall rise audit the hard right to ... to ... which is becoming a fortune ... in ... I'm going to make his pocket dot moving the state and how it's going to pan out in the coming months would be very interesting so much depends now on the future direction of ... policy she will adopt\n[noise] Judy thank you to do them see from ...

World Service [noise]\nEighteen minutes past the hour Francis Fukuyama made his name in Nineteen eighty nine with or provoke the title essay the end of history question mark at\nThe time western liberal democracy seemed to be winning out sober communism and author of terrorism in the essay argued that liberal democracy will be mankind final form of government to do stick by the way mostly tobacco idea his latest book\nTakes on the rise of populism it's cold identity contemporary identity politics and the struggle for recognition\nHe says liberal democracy has been having a tough time since its peak in the early to thousands\nI liked democracy I think it's good for the world and I think it's good for the people that live in democratic society so I think it's an ominous development when you get threats democracy\nWell very many people in your native United States like the fact that democracy helped elect President Trump and I think that he's pointing that corner\nWell actually what we're talking about his liberal democracy so the democracy park refers to people voting\nBut the liberal part refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances to make sure that what the people choose doesn't churn eyes over their fellow citizens doesn't excessively concentrate power\nAnd that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of a populist politician like Donald Trump\nWell hang on democracy is only a good thing when people voted in a way that you'd approval\nNo I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law you know people can make lots of choices but\nTheir choices cannot uh include for example the depriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' they're equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us\nWere linked to see between demanding dignity and identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have that we have this inner source of dignity but it's not being adequately recognized and that's where we go into politics\nBecause we want political recognition that a dignity we want the society to acknowledge that we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender ethnicity than race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that's propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years you recently got a voice now from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't do yes I did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nAh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect it's something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of that National Community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know when I\nWas born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this was really an option for me\nNow there will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like the old dining hungry who you mentioned in your book I'm like the alternatives that Germany movement that you will send mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat a Californian view you know what a liberal Californian view your day night has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and got all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to have a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of\nBeing open to people uh you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\n... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say are you know not California and that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIs a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in ... in in the U.S vote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans\nSurely that's democracy if black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt uh is Chrissy an action or and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI hits I'm\nThe Justice Department and I think that if she gets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the

things\nDo up to ... and we'll keep you across the situation here on health check\nNow Claire a couple of weeks ago we were talking about life expectancy is and how long people might live two in the future and ... but now it's a study looking way beyond that so how long humans might live in the distant future\nAnd that's just vexed question of whether there is a natural limits to the human lifespan which we can never go beyond regardless of what medical advances made now this is a debate it's been going on ...\nOh yes because everybody's aware that life expectancy has been increasing for quite a long time and that's always been this question I vote when it's going to stop and many people have thought well it's got to stop at some point and it's got to be some natural limit to what the human body is capable of\nSo the latest study has a ... from quite surprising angle they looked at ... uh when we die and they look if you plot the age at which people are likely to die on a ...\nYou can see this time any one particular point in time or it's a beautiful ballad because it goes up and then he reached the peak and I ... back down on the other side in a nice symmetrical cut of\nI'm not a beautiful ballad because has been shifting ... uh in people's lives of the century has broken progressed\nSo um it's just been the kind of still looks the same now if there was some natural limit on human lifespan you would expect that the right hand side of the cubs would start to get compressed and which are much more cramped up but it's not doing that\nSo you think I thought so cluster often that you have I don't know loads and loads and loads of people dying eighty five Ninety exact not what's happening\nExactly and it's not doing that so I'm of course he doesn't tell us that are done and I can never be some limits on our lifespan it might happen in future that the cub Will Stone altering but what we can say is that hasn't happened yet there were no signs of it happening yeah\nUm why should that be a limit if you can find ways in the future of preventing cells from becoming cancerous and you can find ways of preventing dementia and you can find ways of replacing bones and grabbing new bones if necessary why why shouldn't we just carry on getting older and older\nWell it's quite speculative but some people have proposed that that might be some kind of natural physical limits on all buddy for instance maybe I'll just a destined to crumble after such an age or\nMaybe the race it which uh we can replace me cells just can't keep up with that than dying um but I just I thought was quite theoretical and there's no sign of that happening yet\nThanks class now that I was saying when we discuss life expectancy a couple of weeks ago it was Spain that came out on top with the U.S slowdown in less than you might expect a lot of the reasons for this was because every day in the U.S an average of a hundred and Fifteen people die from an opioid overdose\nThe people come from all walks of life but in San Francisco a team of public health workers it's focused on treating the most vulnerable populations homeless people on the city's streets\nNow is that a couple of weeks ago on the size of the homeless population is very visible next month voters will decide whether the city's biggest businesses many of them tech companies have

comes in and they were like hey Anna I've been using a lot I'm not going to say oh you shouldn't do that would be like oh well what are your thoughts around that what's happened with that and then just kind of carry that conversation like that\nDon't know but let's say that if before they couldn't actually remember at least of Maine's after let's say ten minutes now they can do that so there's a little bit\nImprovement but the main improvement for me it's about ... out to be Gadhafi go memory\nSo once they start to do ever met their memory and about the best for months through the memory do start to do that a lot of their own stories\nWhich is something that it becomes really really bad in the form of dementia so at least reaching that point in which you can remember something of your life or your own life that I think something really good\nSo would you like to see more reading aloud in presidential campaigns to try to help people\nObviously obviously I Would like to see these ... many many different situation because it's a strong draining it's a really good training and it's so it's really cheap and easy to implement you just need a book and everybody will most everybody we have a book in our house and someone who reads will you\nDo up to ... ... this was a small study so I guess it's not suggesting this was enough to slow down the process of dementia or is it but it's it's really interesting\nIt was really interesting um we we've got to be careful as well because I'm with these kinds of studies\nThat can be a big placebo effect you know just from the extra stimulation that people got probably interacting with the the people who were reading to them and in fact she's already recommended by nice the official ah UK and they check guidelines buddy\nUh that's one thing you can do with people with dementia is just try and get\nThem more mental stimulation in in various ways you know just talking to people and trying to stimulate them a intellectually in any way you can\nAnd this reminds me of some of the interventions that do take place the other studies have been done on with people with a bunch of things like singing all reminiscent therapy yes\nReminiscent therapy it sounds almost similar because in a way I'm getting them to tell their own stories and find new uh you talk to people about their memories from that used and you you might use products like photos\nFrom when they were children or object so videos if you have them to try and get him to talk about some of that very old memories and we do know the same people with dementia often issues so very oldest memories to tell them mixed intact\nSo I guess with the lack of effective medication anything that might help people's members if they've got to venture is going to be a good idea yes\nIt's understandable that people are resorting to all these rather unusual techniques because unfortunately we don't really have any good medicines\nThat can do a lot of dementia I mean they're all so much that people can be given they tend to just um ease ... hops don't want for everybody and unfortunately they they can get side effects to set and not right for everybody so and this

increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy whose students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in class what we're seeing on the news as supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed\nAnd what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people have thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which assumed to weigh a financial

textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy started to the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics is taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches that in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they get bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration filled by students and their teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others of building a new

well I did my best can be prevented stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recalling him was on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it would be horrified at the abuse

a lot of spending promises\nTo get elected now they're in power and trying to honor those promises but to pay for all that they have to raise the amount of money the government borrowed and compared to the previous plan that the previous government had\nThe government barring that amount is a lot bigger and that's why Brussels isn't very impressed\nAnd the problem is how enormous the national debt already easy basically a break some rules does it\nYeah so he said no country should have debt that with more than sixty percent of its GDP or its annual national income unfortunately Italy has more than twice that amount of debt it has a debt to GDP ratio of a hundred and thirty percent or two point six trillion dollars\nNow the Italian government says it will increase gross that means uh

the world for the initiated Fortnite is a collaborative shoot 'em ups survival game essentially\nIt's also a big money generator and now the creators ethic thing going one player Brandon Lucas who was posted videos on line on how to cheat while playing the game\nSo how big of a problem is that when the online video get within the online video game industry let speech Eli Gibson videogames journalist who joins us in the studio great to have you with is Ellie\nJust before we get into the the the problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game for I'd I don't play but I've heard of it how is it a global and a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it\nWell you don't have to ... to pay any money to play the game was down there again I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season policy about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to sort of cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nAnd but yeah it's not really an money generating game in the sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy that stays in power and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted online there and why the company at the games is suing that player\nLucas so yes it probably is accused of making these hacks to the game and setting them and these are enable pious to cheat basic cake so he's made the ... ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim it than it does it for you

it's a hugely popular game and and some people who have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas knowing for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating and of\nCourse the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software ... uh Fort Night\nThat's why they basically accusing these people have copyright infringement and they're saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have ... essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one though surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does\nThis in fact you could say oh you mean is that he's being singled out he believed at some fat he says ... notes of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think ... haven't been care about the only thing they were probably ... that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to start somewhere and perhaps they're trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will be\nAnd is this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know if there's even a fast food night rainy they vote yeah they they had some people the rest of it I think in um uh this is a different game actually paranoid about two grounds and that it has to be

three locations here in in St john's area that\nYou could walk in off the street by the candidate but for for now for the most part\nYou'll be ordering it online it's controlled by the same corporation of government that controls the sale of liquor\nAnd they brought in older roles of regulation companies have to fly in order to be able to sell it legally there are about twenty two locations off in a in the country right now that can set resort in the province right now they can sell it and they will pay an excise tax the government for a\nWhile it is regulated by government largely a lot of private companies have their eye on this already and we've got in first that if the company that already um that had already set down the\nWith down Bruce in other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move a midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere and seems that you're seeing the\nOh I Would I Would say so St john's is a rather small city about a couple of hundred thousand people and said this excitement tonight is is quite amazing\nThough I Would imagine across the country if you look at larger cities but really for people some of them are Canadians of wanted this for very long time and ah when Justin Trudeau ran to the prime minister of the country\nHe promised people he would take 'em take marijuana out of the hands of of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers and uh and regulated in an attempt to\nTo grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now we're looking at candidate to see what Canada is going to do because Eric way is the only other country in the world\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done it within safe but Canada is really a leader\nAnd a lot of people will be looking at houses on hold it will not be without bumps that hiccup from law enforcement to actually

more about his creative process but first I wanted to understand more about how Johan worked alongside the rest of the developing king of\nThe game has sometimes more than one producer that you know their main focus is to make sure it's a great game yeah but when we talk about me recording studio whatever I'm the executive producer regarding the music the music itself yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ... ... this is the music we're going to use\nWell the one of the producers is my main contact that's the same procedure for every game and as soon as we establish some sort of\nHappiness if ... if I could you know if they're concerned with the material they're getting from me I always want to have the final say I always want to feel free so I'd say you're going to get something like this right but\nYou basically they they all old Ki ay direction and then you're free to yeah to go with it I mean that's very that's the law freedom it is\nAnd I'm not sure that's like normal procedure but that's how I've done it and I haven't asked questions music such a difficult thing to talk about it or if\nYou're not a musician a year or juice or or a director and you meet somebody that you can create a language that they can both understand about music that then you're all ... really and that's what that's like really\nReally tough yes some producers game producers know some about music some have a big interest and are very interested in no you know they might even play the guitar or something and you know the vocabulary\nBut some have no clue whatsoever and I said send me a Spotify YouTube link to something similar your you know you're imagining my products kind of found I can\nI joined us on a few days after you've received he's three for jelly Saigon and he was a ... to start on the first time he'd spoken to the game producer\nAnd he was looking for inspiration for me starting off every job is a bit of a nightmare the blank sheet of blank page with nothing\nOn I live in ... yeah surely you must be a time we spend a day writing and never come up with anything I always hear the music in my head and I follow that thing that I hear [noise]\nSit back and\nKnow that was it ... reaching to kind of get into that a lot more to walk and sometimes need to take a break just go out for a walk\nSo we did just start you on that I wouldn't for strolls\nSo there are quite a few

threatens\nWorking on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an onboard generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be\nAnd what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade to batteries as soon as the battery technology is there describe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the ... that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of

six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted\nVersions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones that very goes developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types then grows\nWe took about taxes I think that the taxi is going to be picking me up from my office

secrets comes from being a journalist\nJournalism is all about exposing the truth and making a basically the scene to max change which is why open secrets fascinate me why do people keep them\nWon't vote an ecosystem enables them to examine\nWhat seems to be interesting about open secrets relative to let's say normal secrets is a typical secret is\nPrimarily kept by a single person\nMichael ... is a professor of management at Columbia Business school he's done research into the secrets people keep and it's also developed a theory of secrecy\nYou'd on something or you don't want people to know about her had an experience that you'd rather keep to yourself\nAnd you're sort of the primary gatekeeper that secret now or if there's something like an open secret where say there's something happening in your workplace and you know a lot of people are aware maybe not everyone in for the same reason we're not talking about it 'cause\nIt'll all blow up a number of multiple gatekeepers where any person could speak up any person can sort of\nBlow the whistle but they don't end well stop people from doing that\nI think people are sort of fear the backlash that might happen if someone's trying to rock the boat even for the right reasons I think a lot of people sort of don't want to be in that position where they're the ones who sort of change things because things probably get worse before they get better a lot of\nTimes there's a good person versus to go to the group\nThat children looked at tacit permission to tell\nIf somebody said are you doing OK today they could discern

adult\nAnything unless they were not making eye contact with them and they would do it when they were helping their parents after dinner wash the dishes if they were cleaning their\nPool or in a car uh as long as they didn't have to look at the adult because that made them feel uncomfortable\nAnd with adults Michael says another calculation is also made\nPeople are trying to do that cost benefit calculation and you know sometimes it might seem like well why would I have to be the person to speak up any press conference because you know why should I be the one to through all this chaos sort of\nIn front of me and it's a totally reasonable suggestion of kind of like a comments dilemma problem one solution perhaps as banding up with other people so you're not alone\nOr another is to really

especially small packages from developing countries subsidize\nOn China is still considered a developing country under this treaty so it takes to get cheaper rates now Jamie smooth done makes mugs in

those oh Jim he's moved on\nThe big issue that we wanted to tackle was the unfairness between shepherds overlook originating their packets from China versus those who were originating from inside the

White House getting rid of this visit level the playing field for you\nThis is a major step to level the playing field\nThat's in large part because the agreement itself as a one country one vote system in which China is considered still basically a developing country that becomes a very difficult problem to solve it of one country one vote system because China can simply vote against your

inside a crate in Western Australia the ... only being detected before when China America Germany and Canada the discoveries causing a lot of excitement in the science world because it might just hold some of the secrets of planet or as we know it including how the dinosaurs became extinct\nWe now live from puff Australia to do to Aaron ... who heads a team of researchers had cutting university the made the discovery thanks for talking to us on a news day festival just had a little bit more what exactly is ...\nOh it's my pleasure thanks a re died a microscopic mineral that forms when the common minerals or con get squeezed by the crushing pressures during impact very rare\nSo we ...\n[noise] well read I can form out a couple of different sizes impacts but the site we found it in Western Australia near shark bay along\nThe coast or is one of the big ones that puts it in a rare class\nAnd part of the controversy is people in the past it argued about its sides are discovery of read I pushes it into a class that is an extinction class of that that doesn't mean that this impact caused an extinction but it's one of the big ones that's rare in our history\nSo essentially a meteorite crushed to or not is what you've been up just average\nYeah here the uncertainty behind this and why it hasn't and discovered clearly before is this is an impact structure that's buried it happened about three hundred and sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the seas and plants just started to colonize lamb\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis another catastrophe but over time it got buried and when we want to study at today we need other means to study it so our discovery was made by drill core collected nearly Twenty years ago\nWhile so it's a historical discovery in a sense\nWell think about this if the impact that hit Mexico sixty five million years ago it didn't occur the dinosaurs would still be roaming the earth mammals may not have all that we wouldn't be having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts can cause dramatic changes\nUh to uh to uh earth and the things living on it\nThat impact as a hundred and eighty eighty kilometers in diameter and the one in Western Australia called Woodley we think it's probably much greater than a hundred kilometers in diameter so it's the big one that killed the dinosaurs isn't even twice that size it's a big event\nLast night just off of our income mostly thank you very much for talking to Newsday [noise]\nNow in about Ninety minutes time

well thanks for having me I knew or is a ... to me because like how I put into you know Indian impacts on the origin I'm an immigrant I came here the u._k. when I was five and growing up I I heard about this woman story and it just became more residents to me and it struck me that very few people knew about\nWhether they were all ethnic minority origin or or Asian or Indian or whether they will push a meaning and white British\nSo in terms of a story she was a Muslim sissy pacifist\nShe was born to an Indian father an American mother and she was actually a children's writer in Paris than when World War two broke out have family moved to the u._k.\nAnd she volunteered for the women's auxiliary apples and two years later she was picked up by the special operations executive which was a special unit created by Winston Churchill and she was a ... fee\nEmail re to operate a to B infiltrated into any enemy occupied France aged just twenty nine years old so essentially she was part of an intelligence unit yes yeah I hate it when the nine ...\nAnd one of the leading ones because what happened was the ... supposed to talk to to round up um their spy network\n[noise]\nOriginally there were actual mechanical models still one on display New Zealand that uses water to demonstrate how money would float around the economy as computing power has grown so to as the complexity of the models which should call them is try to capture the key relationships in a set of clever equations\nWhat professor Nick stone is saying is that the models economists were using to predict the future assumed that if one bank failed would bounce back and most perfect others but why would prevailing models assume that it crashed couldn't happen when economists note that economic crashes occur with disturbing regularity\nPolitics that story of assuming away those things that were dangerous list because economics had had quite a lot of success so if you look back\nAt the ten years before the financial crisis also that what you call it a great in moderation and what that meant was the boom in the past didn't seem to be with us so I Believe is Otis Redding along a cheerful way down the river reasonable state and things are going\nOK politicians believed us to reassuring people that they finally found a way to keep prosperity going forever here's the venue catch on sort of big circa Gordon Brown speaking in two thousand seven [noise]\nWe will not return to the old boom and bust [noise]\nEconomists so happy to blame the models they made for being inadequate but is this enough was the deeper problem with economics the bank of England's chief economist and they held and has no doubt that economists were in deep trouble\nI think we should take some of the black as an economist is and was what my whole life in economics truth be told\nHow we're coast model of how the economy function of how much this to auction to 'em that local smuggled fail at the first offense and the crisis it could not make sense of what was happening around us\nSo of course that was the same thing we can and we should have happened after the Nineteen thirties go back\nReform route and branch seems crazy now to think we somehow lost sight of the importance of finance and money and banking next planning the big ... and the economy\nWasn't the economists who are folks will the discipline of economics itself [noise]\nMy own view is that some economics but the economists have come to dominate the discipline [noise]\nThey have an helpful obsession with perfect markets ignoring the parts of economics which do not adhere to their ideas including the central insights of John Maynard Keynes incredibly\nSo the new economics simply assumed to weigh the risks associated with crises as well as many other failures such as environmental damage who could lose which one forensic to market economy\n\nWill ... the former chief economist is one of the biggest us banks Citibank believes that it's not a failure to see the crisis coming which condemns economists but rather the fact that we were captivated by new fashions which left us ill equipped to do anything about it\nNobody shows coming seeing a crisis coming not doing that I I don't feel particularly bad about not seeing it's coming it's not that uncommon right my doctor doesn't see my diseases coming either but my doctor can prescribe at least I Hope so the right mix\nOnce that disease has been diagnosed but much of\nThe fashionable economics of the Iraq had ... nothing to say about how to handle the crisis it took us far too long to diagnose disease and responses appropriately there was a school of economics that actually did that was how to handle the crisis was old fashioned getting in economics\nAnd a number of people made that point but then people recommend that fiscal stimulus in the face off a deep recession\nThey weren't using frontier economics or the guy that gets ... graduate schools they are using stuff that if they do remember it from the undergraduate days yeah so do you get onto the searches\nThat rather better than the economy of the eighties and nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis highlighted the extent to which was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy whose students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in close what we're seeing on the news as supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning to enact classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people have thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which assumed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become\nWendy colon is the most widely used university textbooks in retrospect she admits these books ... subjects that we usually important in terms of understanding the crash things as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy started to the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this that was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics is taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches that in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true not just about that of many others\nIf you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate I'm going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they give bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration filled by students and the teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these windy and many others of building a new\nFree online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionately about and so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the core charity\nBut will it different curriculum being [noise]\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper cools the to bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nI'd ... comics professor at Stanford University in the U.S [noise] she's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what\nPeople want to hear well turning a blind eye to bind even criminal behavior by buying cars that\nCan freshman financial stability\nThere is definitely a problem it is very very shocking they remain\nReally fantastic early in the sense of how they explored the system\nBut in the end ignoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding sentences and all that deception and fraud and all the excessive endangerment that's entirely unnecessary it's just taken as a given it's just what they accept the system\nAnd does she think this is changed following the crisis\nWhat you were here is more and out you know very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big oil at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible like this before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can be prevented stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recalling him was on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that

I'm In the empire saw some difficult ... much better at doing that today than we were five ten years ago\nThere are people who say that there's enough to be taught with the things that children have to learn\nAbout for example the politics of the twentieth century the extremism that's led to so many very dangerous and deadly wars is this tinkering with history to make it\nA little less white is that essential in in view of all the other things that need to be tool it's which will lead to political awareness\nI think that what we're most interested happening is that stature history rich history more accurate history is taught I find it very difficult to believe that we can tell that sort of history\nAnd without having a more diverse approach to history become possibly teach go ... all of his great uh I'd rather they land rather less range that land that\nCould you give an example of the kind of thing but do you think is not told well enough specific instances\nWell the argument that special straight really and they became a diverse history ethnically racially I'm from the era of winter I strongly that already ... substantial parts of the past for example we have a broader point however which really is that\nThe history of places that we think of as being the umpire needs to be told to expect those places as well as as a part of British history\nIndeed when Russia of course that was perhaps or one of the most important incidents that brought people from the Caribbean to a health\nThe health service and others are other parts of British society at the end of the second World War but of course there were many black people fighting in not only the second the first World War as well so that part of the story I think it's beginning to be told but not enough [noise]\nYeah they get any holiday as that\nMessage is definitely improved dramatically it and we can see this in the recent a stark where I can start teaching about the festival out or that we can get much much fairer that before that as well and tell these braided strain that remind us that British history has not only are white estate\nIs there enough money to teach this in schools [noise]\nI think that the financial pressures on schools at the monitor on nature obstacle to good history teaching we can either that at any level\nVery good talking to you thanks so much and so it's something that you might want to comment on listening at home I BBC done diamond onto it or not just on the teaching of British history but history where you are\nFor example or if you're listening to us in Africa there are lots of changes in the way history is taught but it's the material available at BBC done Damon on Twitter to tell us about that that was professor McGovern Finn or from the royal Historical Society in the u._k.

Programme let me ask you first and it is that the movement here the special summit for November that's been cancelled could can you still see a deal shape it\nHas to be a movement yes I think it's worth remembering the over the course of the last week when the negotiators have been set down in the tunnel is like ... they have made a lot of progress on all sorts of issues the sticking point remains the R respects doping that is cool in between\nThe negotiators in Brussels and politics back home and that's the problem to reason my faces I think she knows what she needs to do to compromise and get a deal the question that she doesn't know whether she can get it through her cabinet or Republican\nSo Brigitte ... does that mean that actually what you're hearing from Europeans are over on the continent is that no deal is shaping up to be the outcome\nNo fault for I think is happening is the European Council is offering treats innate time it's asking the to negotiating teams to get back to work and if ... says at any stage in early November that there's enough\nNothing's been achieved to warrant to European Council then there will be a European Council [laughter]\nSo I think this is back to the tape but it's a question of how far can be done and to quote sold ... agreed that will enable treats them a sign up to us but I think it's also important for me to say as\nI heard Neal Richmond there is no way that any Irish Government were sign up to a withdrawal agreement that does not include a legally binding backstop with as a time limit there can be no time limits I think that's written in it that's written in ...\nWhen exactly and what about what about a ... point that that is something that may not be possible for three of them made it to get through not only the parliament in Britain but her own party in ...\nWell then that's unfortunate the opens up\nThe new deal scenario because without a withdrawal agreement there can be no orderly withdrawal\nI think both sides do not want that outcome both sides are determined to work very hard but it would be wrong with me to give the audience the u._k. audience a sense that this was ... that that was ... room on a deeply binding backstop there isn't\nBut also we must remember that this is what you pay it self ... this is not something the U.S asking crease in may in ... in March of this heat in March of this

the economy of Britain and its relations with other trading partners\nWill look as president said no one woman's no deal because everyone knows that there'll be damaged the damage was mainly in the United kingdom but it will also be two of the member states notably Arlen everyone wants to avoid this and I think left at the moment\nIs the biggest factor that means I'm Still relatively confident we will arrive at a deal simply because the alternative would be bad but there's no doubts about that Brexit is going to have\nA a a negative impacts on the British economy because the government has signed up to a program of leaving the single market and the customs union there was no way of doing that without ...\nUsing barriers to trade with the law just in closest trading thoughtless or the economic impact will be negative\nAnd I met him from the u._k. and are changing Europe thank you and there's a lot from from the road at Truman Center for advanced studies in Florence thanks for

complaints mechanisms I mean let's get back to basics let first of all these people have voice and allow them to make a complaint and race it can stand\nAnd said there really wasn't fantasies on that
