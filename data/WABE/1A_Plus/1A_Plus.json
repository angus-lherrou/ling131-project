and we'll keep moving on to some of your thoughts as well but it's interesting how quickly the discussion around this moved to today's politics understandably because it's been a pretty emotional political moment\nRight and uh you know it brings up this tribalism and the polarization that we see in the media space in which Charlie was ill and others are so excellent it chronicling the far right um hyper partisan reaches of the Internet and the media space but I think\nThe real question here is we come up with a lot of this both sides of them and what about is them that comes out in the media with people saying well you know if there's hatred on the right there is also hatred on the left I Do agree with your caller that what we don't see this radicalized violent\nUm you know enactment of some of the statements that are coming from the very top that is really worrying of course there's always been hate in our culture the problem is that a lot of this hate seems to have been a welcome somehow to come out of the recesses and the woodwork\nUm with a sort of silent not from people at the top and that is incredibly worrying there needs to be instead of blaming the media

I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like down and get us off the only place where this kind of speech to lift weights on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment would First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given to the new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened to Pittsburgh all the more worrisome looks like you\nAnd and sort of shifted the standard of acceptability for\nA lot of ironic racism I I spend a lot of time in a message board communities on the Internet that has had produced you know an a number of of hateful a people and and even people who have gone on to commit\nViolent acts and and some of them most of them aren't\nOf that persuasion but they're they're and they're participating in it um because they're building a community a\nYou know the Internet is fantastic uh at\nFinding people and giving them a feeling of belonging and and oftentimes in some of these underbelly communities it is around using\nA taboo language bigoted language slurs I'm putting down people or you know ... of minority background and I and I ... speaking to some of these people and communities like for a chance you know they said to me I knew that this isn't necessarily right\nI'm and I'm maybe not even I'm I'm not even proud of that but there is a community around this sort of thing and and what it does is it ... ... you to use that language and it starts out in an ironic sort of\nUm you know I don't mean this with any endorsement but for them fun kind of way um they're playing around with things that they can't say anywhere else and ah\nAnd sort of feeling all that out and then it's slowly becomes\nA you know indoctrinated into who you are there is someone who told me that you know when I see\nAfter after ten years of being on these forums when I see you know means or images of anti Semitic means or images I Can't not think about all these terrible things it's hard coated into my brain even if I Know deep down\nMaybe it's wrong for and so I think that we don't talk enough about that that that with the Internet does it build that community but it also provides this reputation and it slowly ships your ... yet will quickly I mean modern social psychology and this kind of study has been replicated again and again dozens of times\nAnd has this it shows that there is group polarization and this happens even before the Internet and but the Internet really magnify that and the idea is when people are listening and talking to extremists they take a more extremist position they become even more radicalized ... economists\nWrote about this and Bloomberg opinion and I recommend the column which really explains it\nCheryl tweeted how do we identify and he'll ... angry men in our society who view violence is the only way to express their discontent interesting question Cheryl put that question to our panel and do a lot when on Charlie wars are won rabbi Jill Jacobs and we'll get to some more of your questions and thoughts as well because [noise]\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to one a on member supported Ninety point one W.

and comments Constance in Silver Spring Maryland writes I Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre\nIt was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump's telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced and root as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAG W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back

America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we will hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks so much for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious situation also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have started with religious views\nAnd a close and actually the state of Israel I mean I teach at a small school here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable House bill that um\nYou know if they express a strong and here is that of Israel or it's this religious views that aren't\nUm you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you are how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not typically\nStrongly support of Israel and one way or the other but um but our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly\nIf they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence in the left that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college\nUm and it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do tell kids they probably should need need to shut up you know and I don't show up at the you know you can't argue with every\nJust kind of you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles and I think that's a hard thing\nYeah to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised didn't do that they're not\nThey're not federal everything will David I'm going to be it can be very hard David let me put\nThat to you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of David comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I Want to say Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course at high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I let it be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and all laughed and very often it expresses itself\nAs a as a tax on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not even criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of these trials governmental policies that we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policy it's rather crosses over into", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "29", "locations": [["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["China", 35.0, 105.0],

draft of history the host and creator of that podcast probably let me come to you wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer\nTo the data industrial complex which has been a phrase it's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex of the prison industrial complex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nI thought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't stay in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's the hats because I mean well he doesn't want to go that far but\nBut also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the uh the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are\nBut I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not regulation of some ... some farm is is on its way it's coming and so at some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it within tail\nAnd and and and I think what cook has tried to do in this speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support as a of a potential data privacy laws in the United\nStates we should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's this\nA you area law that protects the privacy the data privacy of individuals\nWithin the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the e you if you've noticed re in the last few months that a lot of the website you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website we maybe try your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist mistreatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nAfraid of this month juicy under parliamentary privileged to blame for green as the individual in question given that the media for being subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of the story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord Hain or Baron the pain of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privilege to name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this\nSuch a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example a clear example of the very significant differences between free speech laws in the u._k. and in the

A. M. U. dot org glad to hear from some of you across the state of Florida\nAbout what you're looking for from the next governor\nLarry tweeted I Hope that when he wins mayor Gillum will remember the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle they may be the ... parts of Florida but represent a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our state\nLarry that is a such an important point and I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through the impacts of hurricane Michael er we had Ninety percent of our power knocked out thousands of trees come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week uh we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared and a sense of normalcy returned to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch a our utility workers or to the western panhandle just west of us\nAre to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region will return we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not that that politically that that is a community that will be for me\nUm is of no consequence there Floridians and there were a part of a of our state they is often been forgotten\nForgotten coast would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help to define an economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of the state of Florida\nBefore we add one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit one of the conversations that constantly comes up whether it was after Hurricane Harvey last year after hurricane Michael this year Hurricane Florence earlier\nIs about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach in basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in the areas that are very much at risk for rising water levels ... Gulf levels ocean levels\nAs climate change progress is and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite although the drone pictures of homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the homes that were were standing in the homes of weren't we're we're we're toothpicks basic that's right that Governor ... that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point has\nTo tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here\nYou know it's it's such a fair point on and and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and lie to the fact that we're seeing stronger in and and more increased storms I'm particularly up the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nBut then if then if you tell people where they can't live that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean well listen\nRight now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes I'm Better nice and luxurious thing yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there\nAnd so that puts the entire state at risk for having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm us a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real estate why conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise in climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for properties to be built and to be built and frankly in an ... resilient way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out\nUh with these increased storm of events and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there's a panacea I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be happening to begin this conversation I think is going to be a state wide conversation and it's one that we're going to have to lean into with county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor ... take part in this discussion or a future discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly loved to have you on the program\nWhat's that one more voice to the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is Luis Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a\nPublic education system that kind of a printed ships that used to exist in Florida would workshop mechanical electrical technical although those kinds of programs that allowed our kids to get a skill that they could monetize go to work\nGet a job earn a good wage it's a win win because we are training there next generation workforce\nLimit gets one comment about that very briefly Middle East I Know we've got time for about one more question from you with regards to what ... what you were just referring to\nWanda emailed for you to explain what she wrote as the one billion dollar tax increase proposed by him inside it in his opponents commercials wander writes I'm a Republican who was leaning to voting democratic in the midterms but a one billion dollar tax increase gives me pause so that's what ...\nThat's what I Want folks to be clear on this is our money\nRight this is the these are public dollars um that used to go into the the federal system obviously which also a winds its way down into the states\nThat were given away to the wealthiest corporations and the wealthiest one percent I'm an ... and guess what look you know it ... elections have consequences that it past the President Bush did it made its way through Congress\nBut here in the state of Florida a we have a crisis forty of the ... the state of Florida is ranked it's public education system is rent for to get out of fiftieth in quality right the increase per ... per pupil spending in my state was forty\nThree stinks last year forty three cents our teachers in the state of Florida are paid the forty low with average salary of all fifty states not listen\nI I don't want to pay any more than anybody else and and we won't under any of my tax proposals including for those corporations they will pay less under a governor Gillum then they pay under Governor Scott but if we're trying to be a leading state\nThan we can't have company saying I Can't come to the state of Florida because I Can't get the talent that I Need in that state to build the jobs that we're creating where the third largest state in America it should not be our challenge that we can't produce the talent that we need for the workforce that we got to build\nA mayor we ought to pay for your promise loose loose front and his war question can you stay around for like two minutes after the break

I think Trump won putting in thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages\nAre but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today I'm with students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando a hosted an event\nI'm I'm ... I'm a a little while ago and was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ...\nA which went really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us\nIs that in the primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand bow to turn out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes\nUm it's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county and lose another the one who wins is the one who gets one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there\nWill go in because we're going to get voted a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor deal in so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners perhaps we'll have a chance to talk to you again but one more matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... two questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emailed\nMayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground as it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already had castle doctrine which allows for individual to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders I'm a onto their property right\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be clear the difference between what you're talking about just by way of contacts the castle doctrine you're referring to\nBasically is that kind of your home is your castle idea that says you have the right to use deadly force to defend yourself at home weren't worth stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel threatened anywhere you have a window right to be just\nAnywhere yeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "22",

actors who do that today that's different from Americans who were genuinely\nConfused about the issue and need to be informed and need to be reached culturally\nWhere they live and I think that's an important point the second thing I'll say is that it's time we injected some American can do spirit into this discussion\nWhen John Kennedy was confronted with the space race in the Cold War he challenged the country in ten years to reach the moon or what disappoints me about President Trump more than anything if he's kind of a climate wimp the problem is too hard for him he just can't deal with it\nWill let me wait hold on a second let me let me just push back against I Know we have to pause and made it but his name calling going to help the debate for climate change calling the president a wimp I mean is that helpful\nA he's a defeat us um you've got to call them like you see it but it's kind of hit by a longer more SAT is word wimp defeat is I mean is that helpful he's denying\nA problem that is threatening the safety and welfare of the American people sometimes we have to say like it is Joshua we can't sugar coat the truth when we come to the American people's safety security and economic future Sarah\nI Know we've got a positive but it but it's Paul right in my being a little bit too forgiving in terms of the way we talk about the president\nI mean my view is that we need to indict publicly years who are trafficking in science denial as a form of misconduct and a form of putting the American public in to danger however I Do think that we as scientists have engaged\nNonstop in trying to confront denialism and often that engagement is a very it's coded male power brokering that is very problematic in the culture because it pits people against each other instead of focusing on shared values\nLike you want to focus on some of more of our shared values and how we talk about climate change as we continue with Sarah ... of the role and Institute and Paul Bledsoe American University's Center for environmental policy we also heard from some of you've seen the damage from hurricane Michael and how that affected your view of the discussion with

A. M. U. dot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult\nSome of you been giving us your suggestions for what has worked for you or what might work\nMelissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth\nNothing the environmentalist or suggesting would cause harm from my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future economy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\n... wrote that state and I am in a room and I'm very interested in protecting the environment and teaching about\nClimate change\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain myself to others are just regular people who might not have the education that I had\nAbout climate change because from where I'm standing at plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us Paul I wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all\nThis ... it's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions the policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to ... global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible\nBut when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period then elected president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinion\nOn climate Katie emailed my family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he won't consider that just maybe there is a greater sing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening changed the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in and the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and\nYou know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through on through relationship and trust and empathy um because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger um [noise]\nAnd what are the ... why our voices being eliminated from the public forum why do we have such a a partisan distorted narrative\nBut it is harder pointing out that this is a U.S phenomena sure the part as they shouldn't have climate change is not a global phenomenon\nIt doesn't exist in most of the world and we need to reflect on the U.S political and cultural system right now in our norms and and do some honest thinking about\nAre we being manipulated by people who have self interest that aren't\nMatching up with the long term self interest of the American people which is what many of us believe is happening this is a U.S problem almost uniquely and its political and cultural aspects\nI Would agree with that but I just want to reflect back again that the entire world by and large and the world's global resources are run by men and those decisions are made by a man and so one of the fundamental aspects of solutions for climate change has to do with anti racism\nAnd an anti ... and that is that a global level is that the closer we get to on an equitable and safe society for every one specifically for the rights of girls and women then that's a component of the pathway for us to get the orders of remind added options there\nIs a little more with this I'd like to discuss I Know we have to pause will finish this up on the other side of the breakout like us to kind of do a lot\nBut of role playing of what you can see the folks in certain\nKinds of debates to some of the more common objections including like just that being or cycles are where does a science come from we also got a good question is Marlene who wrote on our website the one eight dot org so if you change people's minds what then\nI see a lot of people who believe in climate change the do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives there still driving around and gas guzzling SUVs owning their own make mention houses with the thermostat turned out not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's\nLike it's someone else's tomorrow not ours interesting point Arlene even if you win the argument what do you do to turn the argument into action and if you haven't done that does that mean your argument failed that's ahead because\n[noise]\n\nIf you were like us You're probably already talking about mid term elections because while they're important\nDemocrat here can't figure out the right way to campaign against the Republican late night and with Republicans in control of the federal

shut you down and drains you\nNeed to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you

owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who\nAcknowledge like ah the congressman from some South Florida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few common objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would happen to years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] there's evidence that um that that those protections are coming through I mean all of that pieces of protections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentrations and we are able to do a very good job at projecting or the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issue is not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there's ... there's complexity and how the regional climate and the seas analogy of different places are influenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so\nWe do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we

A. M. U. dot board we heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories\nAbout exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi Sheila this is Carol elaborately I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to uh that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we applied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted\nAnd it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um we can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but ... broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back I'm a retired\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community is one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long art and being part of that is I think really important ... one of the things I Love to think about is shown is was hundred bastard on\nHunted mastodon\nHunted best it I think about that long arc\nYeah yeah I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture\nAre there other kinds of benefits that you find whether their intrinsic or extra benefits of being an acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth\nProtecting that are worth keeping their proper places I mean Carol talks about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what other kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our ... our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA test is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it they take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and modify it and they make money they make\nMoney off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with them mugging titled meant like they've lived the life of a native\nLike somebody's ever called them an engine or a or word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies out the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nShould know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today\nThat we did a discussion about the use DNA testing kids the ones that say find nurture ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October seventeenth we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from where we spoke to a geneticist\nAdam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what they can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you were going to do one of these home DNA tests\nYou'll find that conversation with Adam Rutherford on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one daughter a dot org\nBrittany tweeted I Am a ... Hanukkah or mohawk and I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help me to issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focused on this\nWhat do you think is going to happen carry in this in the Senate race in for the issue at large I hate to ask you to to forecast the future but what does the trend look like what are people kind of expecting from this race\nWell if we pull out the ... [laughter] I think I think it's really hard to know look it's um the polls have Kramer are solidly ahead of hike camp um polls have been wrong before polls were wrong in twenty twelve when Senator hike camp one and I would draw your attention in North Dakota to the math\nTypically between two hundred and fifty thousand and three hundred and fifty thousand people in the ST turn out to vote in federal elections what that will be this year I'm not exactly sure at presumably on the high side for mid term but that's about the range of people were talking about so it doesn't take much to to change an election\nPlenty we have to pause and just a moment but mark what are you seeing in North Dakota where do you think this has had\nWell I think this will make it a lot closer than it would have been I think it would have been very one sided election before this all happened so whether it will be enough or not for us that are kept to win re election I don't know but I think it would not have been a contest that this stuff\nAnd Simon ... Smith I Know we have to let you go momentarily but what do you see as the as the outlook for this going forward\nThink uh you know I have to agree with mark I think it's going to galvanize so many indigenous people that are going to go out there and I think that you're going to have a swell of indigenous people hitting the polls and I'm telling them no you can't take my vote you know my my voice matters are voice matters where the original people of this land we're stewards of this land and you're not going to take our our rights\nAway from us do you feel more or just feel like this is something that's that's a a growing groundswell among Native American voters across the country this issue of voter disenfranchisement\n[noise] oh yeah most definitely and I think a especially under this this rotten administration\nA lot of indigenous peoples are going to come out to vote and especially to get all of them out we saw how it played out with people like you know when they were trying to get Kavanaugh and then they finally got cabin I and and we're like no this is this is horrible and this is happening on our watch as indigenous people were not going to let that happen\nSome employers Smith a Chicano writer and reporter uh CNN contributor and also in a global Lakota citizen working on a book coming out next year\nAbout his experiences as a Native American in the twenty first century Simon it's been a pleasure to have you with us thanks for talking to his ex for having me we'll continue our conversation in just a moment with mark ... and Kerry levine and we'd still love to get to see more of your questions and thoughts as well about being a Native American voter and the issues that matter to you in the mid term one eight at\nW.

Olin Williams was convicted of first degree sodomy by a split jury meaning there were two jurors who thought Williams was not guilty\nNow he's asking the court of appeals for a new trial like Williams one of those dissenting jurors was African American Williams attorney says Oregon's non unanimous jury system violates the equal protection clause of the U.S constitution\nThe Oregon department of

Hampshire is like politically for those who've never been here in what ways does it reflects other parts of the country and what we've just New Hampshire really unique\nI think in Hampshire it's really a true purple state we sent an all democratic into all female delegation to Congress which I Believe was a first for the state a Republican controlled every branch of government at the state level some of that can be chalked up to gerrymandering but I think it also just reflects the kind of\nA voting patterns that exist and the true you know kind of live free or die independence that a lot of New Hampshire residents like to think that they have\nIn fact independents are the largest voting bloc in the state they make up about forty percent of registered voters as of the latest tally so that can contribute to some unpredictability in election results and also can contribute to candidates who\nOften are on perhaps less extreme as you might see in other places towards one end up the political spectrum or the other\nI Know we've got to let you go in a moment but Casey what is the polling look what look like right now for the congressional races\nSo there's not a ton of polling here so we have very little to go on that as Dominican sad\nBoats congressional races are looking like they are leaning toward the Democrats right now that said obviously a lot can change between now and election day so it it you know for that reason and also for the reason that outlined given the at the political makeup of the state it could be you know could turn out differently\nWhat does it seem like it was going to make the difference who's national issues or more local issues\nI think a local issues I think New Hampshire it's really a state where people are very plugged in politically to what's going on at the state house what's going on at their local town government a lot of the candidates while they will referenced what's happening in the national landscape and I think are increasingly doing that in New Hampshire on at the end of the day people are really building about what's going on in their backyard\nSo far people up about say Nancy Pelosi or Donald Trump isn't a hundred percent effective\nCorrect and I think people are ... are concerned with issues like the opioid crisis issues like health care issues like the economy taxes New Hampshire as a unique tax structure here so that you know can be very I their influence on people's voting patterns of\nCasey McDermott covers politics and policy for New Hampshire public radio Casey thanks for talking to

A. M. U. dot for them and I wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization of today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\n... is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nYou know a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics and the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact\nWe're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest for seeing high turnout in primaries in in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a Pew sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nShirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and are particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home\nAnd I'm an off year or mid term here and there's a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republicans ... Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennial voters of color or Latinos African Americans and Asians who are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home\n... is there a certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan congressmen who chairs the demographic democratic congressional campaign committee as they don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house\nOf turning the house ... but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue wave crashing over a pack of some ten seats or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three at turning the the hospital and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue wave was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be pumped again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nThat was twenty sixteen we had two very different kinds of advertising ground games you had Hillary Clinton who did a lot more conventional advertising Donald Trump did a lot of online advertising kind of burned up Facebook but how do you see the difference between twenty sixteen twenty teen ad watch\nShirts I think the biggest thing to go back to what one of 'em the earlier caller talked about that I've heard and seen differently as how they can't campaigns are approaching this issue of health care I think that several years ago you could never imagine that Democrats would be running ads touting their support\nFor the foreseeable CARE Act but the landscape is so different now you know\nI'm over for election cycles you saw the Republicans accused Democrats of messing up voters health care with so called Obamacare they vowed to repeal it they try they failed and it's going to Democrats an issue to really pounce on I think that we've also seen in terms of advertising a lot of these ads have gotten frankly and not just on TV but also in some of the mailers that we've seen\nReally personal and really jarring and I I think there are some of that and twenty sixteen but I think it's gotten a lot more that way and twenty eight\nAnd if I can give you one statistic the when when media group a witch citing or can't our media a which tracks a lot of these ads and buys a lot of these ads half of all the ads that were run in the month of September were healthcare related ads and most of those were pro democratic\nAnd as one of notes that is a huge shift from twenty ten and an ironic twist given that Republicans took back the house fueled by opposition to the Affordable CARE Act\nI Want to make sure I'm clear on what statistic was half of all the political ads nationwide ran last month trial on health care that's right and and most of those were pro democratic before we got a pause and limited but\nIt's amazing how surprising and not surprising that is I mean if you look at even Google's figures for what people have been searching the most in the run up to the election healthcare has solidly been the number one search for months\nYeah and I would say one other thing about some of these issues in the polls because a few recently looked at as some of the issues and how far apart people are on them\nThey looked at opioid addiction which I Know a was mentioned in our New Hampshire segment or the deficit and health care as three of the N. F. ethics by the way as a threat before very big problem facing the country and all of those are places where Republicans are on their back for\nMuch more to discuss as we continue with Dominican lots of neuro Katie Sanders and want a summer still time to get in some of your questions and comments as well liberty emails you can't ignore all the voter suppression going on in Georgia\nA whole group of black seniors were kicked off the bus that was to take them to vote will talk about voter turnout and voter suppression in just a moment ...\n...

P. R. dot org let's get to some of your comments about the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the dams to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website in the front page does not say what they are for does not tell me what they care about\nJuana Summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up to the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and how well are Democrats doing an answering it\nWell I think what Laurie is pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that number of the conversations I had\nI recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to make sure they have record mid term turnout and they said that when they're talking to voters are sending out mailers are going and knocking people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling their voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump's base it on I was talking to some groups that dead centerfield testing recently among Latino voters and they Simon and when they get this field testing\nAnd they were saying people were turned off is that if they got a ... a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump space on it they'd be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that matching you're talking about what they can do for them what's at stake that that's\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear about health care message I think is demanding to know that being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo medical I Wonder if we could follow up on that theme was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what judge John left in our inbox\nShould try and make sure to New York\nShow off and on the shows\nPeople for the Republicans for Democrats or Republicans the Democrats or Republicans for instead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for such and for\nThe Republicans to stand for such and such you helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for X. I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for\n... or the Democrats who have done that to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's point that it just feels a little bit too broad brush\nYeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what President Obama did a and regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy\nThat Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party in twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans in how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nStudio I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org listener writes was the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advised to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Cady\nOh I think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a\nAs an Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and that really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do it is a memorable", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "18",
