native peoples inhabited the president to United States for thousands of years before the arrival of people have European descent that they honored protecting the steward at this land we cherish\nAnd then it says whereas whereas the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a new chapter in history of native peoples and then it continues to whereas whereas whereas and whereas\n[laughter] so you discovered this and I'm asked what was your reaction\nI think well first of all what what motivated me to even respond to the apology was the delivery so that's the heart of it or I should say than non delivery of the apology yeah\nBut then I went online and I read the apology and then I was like oh my gosh the the language\nIt's so careful also carefully crafted onion oh my goodness these guys are poets like [laughter]\nI mean very astute in very aware\nOf what each phrase how how do we sit a you know what each phrase may carry yeah the implication of each phrase now so even the phrasing of um\nThe arrival of Europeans opened a new chapter yeah for native people\nThat's crazy it was an opening a new job [laughter] that's\nYeah that's almost poetry is very interesting way to to look at what happened right so and going further into the document\nUm [noise]\nYou know just the idea of for example um they never mentioned genocide right yeah things are phrased as conflicts um lives were taken on both sides and now you know the things like that\nBoth took innocent lives including women and children [noise] you know I mean they do say the infamous trail of tears and long walk but yeah you're right it's very fair and careful\nRight you know I mentioned this to group of students recently I'm at the University of Washington\nBut I'll mention here as well I was watching this really nice video I'm a little talk by face spotted eagle she's I'm ...\nAnd she was the only native woman to receive a boat from the electoral college in this last um two thousand celebrity Lexington yeah [laughter]\nAh she's an amazing um beautiful woman a wonderful speaker to [noise] um and so anyway I was watching the video this little talk she was giving and she was talking about the idea of discussing um history\nDiscussing some of these traumas that have happened yeah and she was saying\nFor native people\nTalking about these things it's important to process of healing uh-huh and for me I think it's not just feeling I Would add to that a sense of justice uh-huh you know being heard\nAnd then on the other hand she said for non native people hearing and listening to these narratives these histories yeah and engaging in a conversation that is not about guilt\nAnd it's not about shame it is about in her words I think she said I'm freedom from denial uh-huh it allows a liberation\nSo I think that that's really um maybe\nWhat was important to me in this work you know and I didn't want to jump back a hundred or a hundred and fifty two hundred years or I didn't want to jump back to ... or send creek I wanted to say this is what it's like here and now you know in my own lifetime\nThis is not history this is not old history it's present in my life in my child's life my daughter's life right\nI'm someone recently asked me a little bit embarrassing um they pointed out how many pieces include my daughter [laughter] in them and it was like oh my gosh that's so true but\nYou know I was a little embarrassed just because they didn't want to seem obsessed but um I think that that was important to me as well um that\nIt's not it's not just not the past it's it's the president and the future I guess that is the world were raving\nI'm ... and this is on the day with the poet lately long soldier [noise]\nYeah I feel like we're talking about something very specific but we're speaking in a moment of time of\nIncredible fracture and there's a lot of apology type thing that hasn't happened and and we're actually building up a lot of things are going to have to be apologized for [laughter] I'm a\nYou know it's one thing I find really interesting that you do in whereas as it's not just that you're not only talking about history you're you're also bringing in\nIntelligence from life about what an apology is and and how when apologies are done well\nI mean in assisting sitting there are scientists are studying to write and I just what you just said I mean ... they can now watch someone give a real apology and haven't received and have it start changing things in their brand\nOf really yeah I didn't but it has to be here but it has since here I mean there's there's I contact and so you register that you register that anyway so you wrote and the beginning at the actually the beginning of your response whereas\nWhen offered an apology I watch each movement the shoulders high or folding tilt of the head both eyes down or straight through\nUm I listen for cracks and uncles are in the word choice what is it that I Want to feel and mind you I feel from offensive\n... [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was really important deliberation knew this isn't just something we need to learn to do together right as a people in that part of your citizenship\nYeah there's the physical presence the energy that is important but\nOn a national skill I mean it's also not just a personal apology\nSo there's things that um are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say\nYou know a family member sit down next to me and apologize [laughter] I'm at a national\nLevel there's a lot more that goes with it right um when I was writing this response or I started researching\nA lot of other apologies around the world or a national apologies one of the apologies that I was really interested in was the one in Canada a\nFirst nations people the first nations right yeah I'm On the boarding school do residential schools\nFor what happened there and the taking of their children and so on\nAnd that apology was read out loud it was like a verbal speech it was a transmitted through um their national television and it had a very different quality\nThere is a very different quality to the language\nAnd pacing of that apology [noise] um I always remember there was this one little a\nShort interview with a an elder a an elder native woman and I can't remember her tribe but in any case so they asked her if things had changed and she said in her opinion no things had really not really changed\nBut she said in just very very simple terms she said you know if you want things to change\nAll you have to do is begin\nBy honoring your treaties huh and doing what you said you would do yeah\nBut I think there has to be a as a kind of trust building right in order for any any kind of apology to be effective whether it's inter personal or\nNational level\nI mean what other things you point out is that um and this was President Obama signed this or that it was signed on weekends and it's not read aloud there is no ceremony and there were no tribal leaders invited to witness it\nComplaining to one of my cousins my sister and he was saying oh it's hard to be called to all we do is pray pray pray all the time [laughter] so it's like\n[laughter] and I yeah I just got a kick out of that so [noise] you know it is is a very real thing yeah and so it is something that um I have really\nAppreciated in love and\nSeeing how that really um influenced every step that the community took I felt\nAnd it's something that I've heard from people who were who went up to Standing Rock it was why I think so many people had a good experience there because there was that prayer in that sense of connection that community um and and\nAll kinds of religious figures all kinds of religious leaders also gathering around with their prayers yeah\nUltimately yeah [laughter] I don't know how you feel\nAbout the language of like Native American spirituality but if I find a dangerous I worry about it being thrown around and\nYeah I mean is seeing actors and the thing yeah [noise]\nI mean listen the thing is is there are over five hundred and sixty\nFederally recognized tribes and that's just federally recognized there are many more that are not recognized\nWho are many of them right now are are seeking recognition but the point is is um all of us are different in all of us have um I'm beliefs and ways that are particular to who we are as a people\nSo you know ... to um beliefs are very different than let's say\nWhere I live here in the southwest from ... some of my friends from Santa Clara Pueblo let's say or Hopi friends or didn't ask friends you mean all of us are our traditions and\nWays are all so so different you know our stories and and they're also so connected to the land you know we come from there's there's not a separation it's connected yeah so\nNative American spirituality or just an awful term it yeah yeah yeah scary it is so broad and yeah\nYeah abstract yeah and it can be very very superficial and out of context right [noise]\nI think one of the most striking ... sentences that I've read or heard in the context of what's going on the Standing Rock as a ... one of The Elders are maybe the maybe the chief saying you know water\nIs not a resource it is a source of life mhm and that is a state matter of fact right I mean it's just we never it's not a way we\nSay it or think about it and it's such and in the whole drama really is such an interesting ah\n[noise] I mean it's so many things about in in you know and and if you look at that sentence it's I'm an amazing testament to the power of how we formulate and understand how something like what if water\nRight [laughter] and how a word like resource that gets thrown around and I throw it around all the time to like crazy it's like one of the big words now can dehumanize off and be away into\nInto belittling\nYeah I've sort of life [laughter] I yeah I mean you know all of these things for [noise] first of all I really I I feel like I have to oh constantly put out ... ... um before I ever talk on some of these issues because\nYou know I I just I'm so wary of of sounding like I'm Talking for for all local to people and and all native people and I'm certainly not an expert on any of these issues but it is again it goes back to this idea of relationship\nAnd seeing it in that way I mean even just for example\nOne of my friends posted something really funny on\nFacebook this morning I think and she was a reminding people when they're um to what was I think red will oh\nThis is the season for getting ready to ... and she was saying now everybody be careful and don't you know take more than you need and leave the plant\nAllow the plant to stay alive for the next um the next year rate so it\nIs always like even just things like that you know like little Facebook posts or what have you I mean it's still alive is awareness right um\nSome guy living a sensibility huh of connection and\nYou don't see the red willow as a um a resource writer you are right something you just take from right it is something you take from but you do it respectfully right in the same place of course to water and a source of life [noise]\nI Wonder um you mentioned a ... a little while ago that you're that you do talk about your daughter a lot in in your poetry and I know that you know and I like I talk among my children and my show um\nI I wondered if you were to read and and maybe this will like you were to use about because I'm not a ... year not speaking for you're just speaking for yourself right but but a single voice of integrity and searching is a window in right to a world\nIn a way that often asking somebody to represent a group in fact does not um [noise] there's this part in whereas there's the part that I can write the page whereas her birth signaled the responsibility as a mother to teach what it is to be like how to\nMhm I I don't want to read that just the like the\n[noise] oh okay see let me find it OK\nOr maybe I'll read the first two they just kinda yeah OK yeah whereas her birth signaled the responsibility as a mother to teach what it is\nThe last quarter there in the question what did I Know about being Lakota\nSignal panic blood rush my embarrassment what did I Know of our language like pieces would I teach her to be pieces\nUntil a friend comforted don't worry you and your daughter will learn together\nToday she stood sunlight on her shoulders lean in St to share a song in dinner her father's language\nTo sing she motions simultaneously with her hands I watch or be in multiple music\nAt a ceremony\nTo honor that didn't nations first poet laureate speaker explains that each people has been given their own language to reach with\nI understand reaching as\nActive emotion\nHe offers a prayer and introduction in heritage language [noise]\nI listen as they reach my eyes into my hands\nMy hands onto my lap\nAs the quiet page\nI hold my daughter in Iraq or doc\nTo the rise of other conversation\n\nOh oh\n[noise] oh\nOh [noise]\nOh my God this is on being today with the poet lately long filter\nO\nO\n\nQuestion I'm always kind of pursuing annoy each individual life\nIs its own way and to this question\nIs you know what what does it mean to be him and\nUm and I also know that that every one of our sense of that is constantly evolving across life but there are some things you said about writing I find so intriguing\nI feel like the way you've written about them is how writing forms you as a human being like you wrote somewhere um it's an endeavor I go into a now

and four\nWe called the literature and so just looking with in was really\nStunning and then the first course was from five in the morning till ten at night and um [noise]\nLittle by little you know I started getting really quiet and still uh of course all kinds of things came up but I really began to see\nThat I was not my mind I was not my body I was as things but I was also awareness\nI began to see the basic nature of the permanence of thoughts as they rise and fall away and\nStarted taking them less seriously it was really wonderful I felt much less dependent\nOn finding things outside\nAnd it gave me a kind of radical self confidence like I Belong to you're on the planet\nAnd [laughter] you know and that uh I Would be able to ah understand the basics of how it is all unfolding I Would say that it also gave me kind of face in the unfolding huh I like to use the word sane face that sort of felt like it felt like\nI had to face and actually the way things are and that that was okay\nMm\nI'm protected and this is on being\nToday with mirror like Bush her life is a lens on a fascinating story of our time Buddhist meditation made its way to the west and has moved into many realms of human endeavor also reviving contemplative practices in other traditions nearby Bush actually took a corporate mapped out of India from\nNineteen Seventy two to Nineteen eighty five\nWith our company called elimination it made it to name which silkscreen ... and other iconic spiritual symbols and made its fortune on the rainbow decals that became synonymous with the Vw beetle counter cultural American heyday\n\nYou know I hear you saying ... said you you had a new insight into your mind and into the world and you know does two things belong together but I feel like in your\nThinking and in the work you've done bringing contemplative practice back out to others you've had a very focused way of tending to\nThe intersection between those two things it seems to me that you know the world that has let's use that word unfolded\nIn these forty fifty years [noise]\nA big dynamic in it is these two strains of inner life fan out or action\nKind of find any other fit fully [laughter] and you know you you didn't realize that you are going to be part of this\nYou know you and a lot of other mostly Jewish and some Christian kids then kind of really importing put him back into the west is pretty amazing to think back on it and how that's how it\nIs I mean when I first came back I mean the idea [laughter] we were so marginalized ... to put it mildly [laughter] and um [noise] uh we\nDidn't quite know what to do that but many of us were really profoundly affected by it and felt that in some way or other we wanted to well first integrated into our own lives fully\nAnd and share it with others and so most of them are single and came back and wanted to teach\nJokes with gold seen insurance sauce Bergen a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I was I'm pregnant and married and I had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back\nMeditation we still have the model of it being monastic\nAnd so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just no one could imagine\n[laughter] right [laughter] [laughter] so\nBut I was just as committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into um\nOur lives in the west so first I started a business with my then husband John Bush and write was eliminated and and yeah yeah but when I was most interested in women nations was integrating this sense [laughter]\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate\nBut we integrated in ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice ...\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah\nSo we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words as you can appreciate [laughter] yeah\nSo I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood now where what you're making is wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the BCS and\nAnd at the same time the way in which you're doing is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later arrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole self into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\nRight [noise] that is a chef that is still a still has a long\nWay to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture\nIdeals and practicality is yeah this story of such and such ourself first of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find\nThat language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take\n[noise] yeah\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemplative mind and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google\nThat or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide whether it was so man decided it was going to be bringing meditation and things that are posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help\nSo I went out there and we talked and we looked around and what we identified was that people are employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm\nAfter talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there [laughter]\nI suggested that we could offer the same practices but emphasize the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could framing and a different way\nAnd so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they are the big search engine search inside yourself and then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress\nAction and we asked Danny Goldman who also is in bug guy or with us back all those years right right\nI'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and on the relationship between meditation and emotional intelligence he did that and then we posted in the course\nSo let's talk about where like the rubber meets the road than [laughter]\nGet back down to the ... really level well like so I Want to talk about the ... have you done workplaces [noise] uh-huh and this is Google but it's other places as well and you've also worked I think with social activists yeah a lot [noise] well\nI just remembered this year the freshman at Amherst College had they all had to choose a three day orientation in their first week of school\nAnd out of four hundred entering students Seventy chose meditation and yoga so there's a big change and a half so I'm\nThe first day you know I was teaching them mindfulness and having them you know watch their breast which they had just arrived on\nCampus they were and they had like worked like fiends you know to be able to get ahead and do you arrive on campus yeah [laughter] yeah so I left a lot of space for I'd say I teach the practice and then I'd say\nSo any reflections on that any questions and there'll be dead silence [laughter] okay well practiced a little more and then I asked you know what he would make themselves vulnerable enough to ask her land right so I decided\nOh better change this around so I I'm sides it gives them a practice of mindfulness an object and I gave them each a leaf\nAnd they were to bring their awareness to the leaf and then as distractions arose let them go and bring your mind bacteria leaf\nSo we did that for five or ten minutes which is a long time to look you know usually you look at all leaving you say oh okay I thought All right and and I didn't really expect that anybody was gonna say anything [noise] so I left a couple of moments at the end nobody dead and then\nThis one football player in the back row raised his hand and he was he had become in my mind the person who most was kind of resisting right make him so vulnerable and anyway\nHe said can I say something and it like you said\nI Love my leaf [laughter] oh it was so beautiful yeah and then they all started talking about how you know what it was like to really look and look and look and\nIt just made me realize that you know it's so much easier to do the things that we've done what I Know that some\nChristian groups called crimes against creation\nWhen we're so out of touch with nature and um [noise] so ... that one moment like this kind of this window into what we need to remember in order to make the right decisions for the future\n[noise] it also um\nYou know sometimes I feel like we we hit the twenty first century and I I think of this has kind of spiritual technology right meditation and mindfulness and contemplation on ya yeah it's almost like we like we're discovering all these other technology and then we're kind of\nWaking up to the spiritual technology that we have just need to back to our census almost I mean I Wonder a lot about\nYou know whenever you stand in line these days or do anything that involves waiting yeah um we're all on our phones immediately were never alone and whenever you know we're always we're always engaged with our phones that I'm I'm kind of starting to wonder like what did we used to do it All right\nDid we I mean you're talking about looking at a leap but I mean did we look\nAround and I mean I Know there was bored I don't there's no romance attached to this but somehow we survived and flourished and it just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds are inwardly then or even in terms of our relationship to the world we were standing in\nYeah that is completely gone now\nDaydreaming ... which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain [noise] um I don't think we do as much of that [laughter] teaching these students also we\nAt the end of the day we did that the yoga and in a deep relaxation\nAnd um of course they weren't allowed to use their phones during the day [laughter] but it's just it's a dish of us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done yoga class you know those sites like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter]\nAs soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass fan and I saw these arm's reach out [laughter]\nFor their phones and about lying down [laughter] sorry for far right they brought their phones in front of their [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the sacrilegious right [laughter]\nRight well but okay so and you did not all that beautiful workers Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about and it's very\nPractical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what'd you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devise that at Google loves that she put her magazine um I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise] you just type\nOut your email either a response or an initiating email\nAnd then you stop takes three deep brass follow your brass\nIn and out in and out [noise] and in and out and then\nYou read the email and you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on an emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be\nAgitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion or maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever\nWe asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it\nIt was a week in between the classes and so a week later they came back and we said how did it go\nAnd um [noise] they all said that was radical me using and then one\nI said I did something really radical I said what he said I picked up the phone\n[laughter]\nRight [laughter] so\nYou know I mean there we all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful really helpful\nI wanted to go back for a minute 'cause I didn't answer your question about social justice activists I'm really ... I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nYeah but what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and then notice what your anger is see it and\nRecognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it ... mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to boats see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it and communicate it we did a lot of work with lawyers and judges\nAnd they lost a hundred and is there anything about that I wanted to ask you about that is so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter] it's\nI mean we ... we laugh but it's yeah you know it's a date with lawyers worry that\nCan they be a zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men is not eliminating wise discernment\nIt's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are\nUnbelievably overworked", "show_name": "On Being", "year":

department of environmental quality\nIs being very weak and giving out permits a [noise]\nAs one of the people I interviewed said like candy so the state looks terrible the company it looks good it's kind of emotional actual manipulation you could say to get you to feel like the company is your friend to feel like the state is your enemy [noise]\nYeah and there's ... you also describe this interesting dynamic that um\nThat again is is ... it's not something that would be obvious anybody out a lot of this is true but I mean for example you um you you had this chapter called the remembers\nAnd there is something where you you just it's just amazing ... about a sociological understanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power\nAnd then you say so ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory fell in part to respectful clerks in federal offices and to know environmental us\nAnd it in in a way it kind of models kind of direct more an right they\nThat right [laughter] too kind to fool right just right All right that's right you do\nIt somebody said asked so after Charlottesville now that we've seen that\nYet how can you talk to these people and\nYeah and and I to me another great paradox that engaging difference which is you describe right as you said it's not about going in and saying change my mind I Want to be Republican right our I Want to join the dean already are for or expecting them to because engage with using you know I I Want to I Want to be at Berkeley why didn't [laughter]\nI'm see I didn't change our politics and what you said and and I think this is true and I know you've seen as a sociologist across all kinds of like meaningful encounter with different you said in in large me as a human being right\nRight it did it dead [laughter] and uh\nTo be able to imagine myself into a different heart [laughter] one man told me you know look we have\nSimilar mines and we have similar hearts but we have different soles\nI thought that was so interesting and so I said to him thank you for saying that um would you be a coal sociologist with me and figure out how to soldier different and he looked at me\nSo scratch just said well I'm not sure what I Do what you mean [laughter] oh yeah you know this empathy thing or another wonderful encounter\nA was with a gospel singer who was sitting across the table at a meeting of Republican women of southwest Louisiana and she said\nOh I Love Rush Limbaugh [noise] well I first thought oh my goodness [laughter] oh and then I thought wonderful I his chance for me to get\nHere so I said to her could we meet sometime this week for some sweet peas and and you can explain what you\nWhat you love Rush Limbaugh and she said yeah sure so the next day we're meeting for sweet tea is and she explains I rub love Rush Limbaugh because he hates seminar sees\nI thought oh my goodness oh ... so I ask what what is a feminine ... well it's a it's a feminist to you know done like children doesn't [laughter]\nWants men coke and uh\nShe goes on to our mental wacko ... is people that want to regulate us to death and\nAfter I'm asking her she stops me and says I'm you've told me that you uh come from all the other side is a is it hard for you\nTo listen to me and I told her actually it's not hard at all I have my alarm system off and you were I'm learning about you and you were doing is such a big favor to share your thoughts on like can't tell you a grateful I Am and then she says\nTake your alarm system off I Do that too she says\nI Do it with my kids ... hot parishioners and I thought you know okay we'll start with no yeah little common ground for\nMe in fact do that all the time because I was gonna say what do you mean when you when we say you know do you is it a moment where you say okay my butt but actually we had it's habit we have in in the other player I between at work right because you can't just blurted out well how you really feel about what someone said at every moment of a\nNo no they're rules about that there should be some kind of the ground rules socialist [noise]\nYeah yeah yeah one thing I can get really better at it than than we are so that's a great invitation yes doesn't mean that church ... pitch a leading see that's the misunderstand the ethics yeah especially on the left oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over a\nHunting not at all no ... none of them just means being emotionally intelligent you've developed a way\nOf talking um yeah actually that is the fundamental floor of social interaction you barrel on in there\nAnd ignore the competence and [noise]\nUh identities personally want to yeah just counterproductive it\nIs counterproductive and I sometimes want to say the way people talk down to\nUm\nYou know any points right that might be made I I Want to see you know do you want to be right in every moment you know what you want any part of a larger healing [noise]\nThat's right that's right we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution help build a a public conversation about the big issues that day in order to do that\nYou have to really be good at a emotion management [laughter] you know making its contribution to the larger whole to be really good\nAbout [noise]\n[noise] I'm Krista Tibetan dishes on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion highly hawk shield [noise]\nThroughout strangers in their own land in his time you've spent um [noise] in Louisiana is\nAnd it's a Bible belts right and one of the things you found which I think it's an interesting critique for you know the more the side that considers itself to be an lightened is um [noise] uh\nThat regulation that a lot of the things that are coming up people asked what needs to be done in fact it's not about ... herring like not about how do we get whole I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made\nA lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense than the government mhm\nMhm [noise] so that's a question okay what has the government done phew\nYou know maybe they will point may be a it hasn't lived up to its promise or maybe it's getting blamed some things didn't do okay let's figure that out let's get right back for public conversation about just that [noise]\nIt is the government kind of um [noise]\nIn fact letting people down you know or are they expecting too much of it what's the record so ah let's let's talk about that and the specifics yeah yeah\nThere's you know there's a paragraph in your book where you just ... even among the most ardent in extreme or ... I think maybe this was a ... interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met over five years of research\nYou found specific issues on which there is potential for coalition safeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison populations for a non violent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure [noise]\nUm so interesting to think about what if we started by saying a what we could start talking about tomorrow [noise]\nRight [laughter] wherever hanging fruit right mhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm [noise]\nYou I'm and I'm strangers in their own land you're near the end do you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left gene you write a letter to Louisiana friends on argued say ... you know if you imagine if I if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and\nIn your letter to\nYour friends on the liberal left I was just it kind of humanizing and its provocative and Hemenway consider the possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own\nExperience\nAnd what if you\nGrew up in a family um but so many said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know [laughter] um okay what if that have been your experience\nAnd what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact of your life you know and what if it was a blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job\nNo [noise] I think",

they're at their house about yet there are rather see it as fast [laughter] um [laughter]\nBut you have to read a little while to\nGet to the cookbook um but it's led life lessons from a father to his children because what you also doing that but and I do want to say that you also have\nOur on record saying that if somebody pointed nibble at your head and said you have to either vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton you would have to choose the bullet yes so that's also who you are\nI Need to be aware of my contacts senator I'm I'm a non tax and in that\nIn this book you also said ear you start looking at at I Do think you know this that's reckoning like what how\nWhat have I done and his last year is that is on record is on the Internet that my kids are going to read one day and I want them to understand me and a greater ... and to me that's ... yeah yeah you know I\nI make my living on the Internet I'm very blessed I've had a TV and radio studio in my house or for years thanks to the Internet\nUm I initially got started as a writer on the Internet because I hated being a lawyer and\nI've increasingly become mindful of two things about the Internet one is that all of us myself included um we we can lose ourselves on the Internet and become our worst cells\nAnd then others want to define us by the worst thing we've done on the Internet or even if it was a decade ago in in probably the worst thing I've ever done ... on the Internet was a decade ago people still bring it up that you have no credibility because of this thing you did ten years ago\nAnd if none of us are allowed to move beyond the worst thing we've done there's no incentive for any of us to become a better person\nAnd I wanted to make sure my kids understood that the other thing and I think this is the most deeply disturbing thing about the Internet no one talks about in should\nIs it is allowed every single person in this room and all of us up here\nTo ignore our physical actual next door neighbor and become friends with the next door neighbor on Facebook\nI tell my kids are all the time and I mentioned this book that Jeremiah twenty nine seven says she the welfare of the city in which you're an exile for their you will find yourself Asian\nAnd I really do believe that means your local community\nThe all politics is local if you don't know about the homeless man under the bridge or that your next door neighbors chicken needs food uh you're not being a good member of the American community and my kids need to understand that they need to know their next door neighbor not just the people on the Internet\n\nI'm Krista ... and this is on being today at the University of Montana with conservative commentator Eric Ericson and progressive commentator Sally con\n\n\nThat kind of think that this phenomenon of trolls is like a\nLight is made possible by the Internet on the other hand it's just it's a dark side of the human condition with a new canvas that the anonymity and ending this embodied I'm\nOne of the interesting things you said you've done as he actually well he said he said he said I don't want to brag but somebody at Twitter told you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying that you know\nThat you actually called a bunch of them up a dead there were so many interesting things about my trolls\nEven the word we choose trolls right that the ... you know maybe she creatures who live under bridges in Iraq than they had a very deep you speak humanizing latch yes um\nAnd I I'll I'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um one was um no one thinks they're mean\nNo one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just ... talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\nBy march and these trials didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is mean are uncivil or or cruel or unconscious um and and in fact\nWhen I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of being called things I Can't repeat on public radio on line um\nAnd they're going through a real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this is one of the things they choose to do at that time but still um no one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful\nHow do we deal with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're meanness\nWell the only thing I was just saying that this is I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right now but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and read forgotten it's\nOr it could hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling and\nThey had the opportunity a lot of them apologize no thanks but why would you then do it right in\nA sort of it has something to do with a lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\nAnd so I mean there are studies that when people have to uh you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly so there's this dehumanization\nOf technology that then allows us to fuel the demonization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurturing amplify it yeah yeah yeah\n[noise] um mhm so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem right and I don't look I don't\nI don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually an honest what I really think I'm curious do you agree with this Eric is I come to think that uh that the left\nBy and large uh is nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity in general [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we could somehow figure out a way\nTo say okay you know why I like let's try to do both of 'em but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have a habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other uh-huh and we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many\nPeople in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal to say oh they're a game Trump supporters me that there's still a system there are so as long a full but can I hate them because they're so hateful I aged out of high\nEnd we blame the people for than expressing these views as do not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time mhm so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's intention to be good\nAnd assume I Try very hard in this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard to assume\nI tried very hard to assume that you like me\nIn spite of some of the but in spite of some of the things I Know you've read in ... and ... and ... written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I Want to believe the best in people and I it seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou actually call that a daily spiritual practice fats is you know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of them are related dynamics swell up this which is that\nThe culture we've created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like them [noise] so but in a been a very particular instance are you said something I mean you said a lot of us here at pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nYou said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes yeah and um\nAnd the word goat was in it and yes I'd like to talk to much when I wrote about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and you know and it shouldn't be on ... asked Erick Erickson what us you

Sally and Eric had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who'd come expecting to be bored and instead or riveted they told me they had not witnessed or I imagined that a political conversation like this was possible\nMichael Marcel like Montana Public Radio's program director moderated a few questions from the standing room only audience\nHere's a question in a very particular kind of looking for practical answers to questions are particularly hopeful about this local ... talked about this person wonders if any of you have any practical tips for navigating political mine fields such as the\nPTA or the co-op or the block party\nOkay that's her life happens that's a great question yeah\nYou you know I I Will say that I I have commented more than once in the last few months that ah I I may give up politics for the pope but at some point and I was old city councilman\nI'm elected and it's worse than national bald local politics as far dirtier um people get mad at you in the grocery store 'cause their their garbage was collected\nUm the thing though I Would tell you is to go full circle to wear this night began or just yeah don't\nShoot motives to someone when you don't really know their motives\nUm a lot of people believe a lot of things some people believe things that are mutually contradictory I think we all do I know I Do\nUm but you don't shoot motives\nTo the person you you haven't walked in their shoes you don't know their background and we could all do a better job particularly at the local level in a PTA or or what not ... it may not be that they just want to a ... way to get their kid to hit it over your kid they may have real\nReal reasons for wanted ... just getting out of a beauty motives would go a long way to helping things\n[noise] um\nI'll give a practical tips and a challenge to the practical tip is we we know from neuro science that when people\nA sense an argument\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they picked aside\nAnd no one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments or the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself\nThese are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else to say [noise] um I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological\nIt's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we that's quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day timeout Mexican cartels or\nWhatever our study is that\nYou know look kids who go to racially integrated elementary schools ... grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh\nActivities and after\nSchool programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other that then has a much more positive effect more broadly\nMm mhm [noise] actually that actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask as we have um [noise]\nAs we wind down which is if the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree right and that in fact uh\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition\nIs that we we're not we're not going to let\nGround easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something\nIn life that if it is about also just learning to disagree better\nWhen more integrity more personal integrity not hating I'm like what difference does it make and like the two of you have been in Europe both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally says I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and\nAnd Eric ... yeah you said some of them that we're paying your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have men\nCan still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all centers um what is the experience you have what does shift which is what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um\nHave had the experience myself of being unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel on line or off\n\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself him up for it and I feel better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do\n'em try it [laughter]\nBut it and then as well mhm uh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like a\nI had the privilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories of people who were you know professional hate mongers\nOr kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the targets of that hate\nShowed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they had been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden\nThat in a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate should have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I get that there are times where it feels daily ... demand in some cases it's", "show_name": "On Being",
