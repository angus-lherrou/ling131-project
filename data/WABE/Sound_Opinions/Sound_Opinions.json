the born to run elements a classic example of that he was talking about getting out of town there's this bleak existence that he's living but he's going to get out somehow\nIn Nebraska the entire realm a bunch of characters who are kind of at the end of their rope I Can't find a way out\nSo we inside the mind of this guy who was driving along begging the state trooper not to stop them the only thing we know about this guy is that he's got no license no registration and what he says there's a clear conscience about the things he's done\nMaybe there's some contraband in the car some drugs and guns is there a body in the trunk you know what I think of that scene in the Coen brothers movie in Fargo were pulled over by the state trooper and suddenly things go from the tension is in the air and and then things go horribly wrong\nThis was almost a set up for that scene in that movie that is a brief snippet of a moment in the life with this character and he's about to snap in about two minutes and you can hear this little Yelp from Springsteen that becomes a war a few seconds later and you get the sense that yes she is finally turned the corner to just completely losing his

ban was associated with the white panther movement their manager John Sinclair was noted radical and self described revolutionary he wrote the liner notes for for a kick out the jams and the emcee but happily went along\nMuch to their chagrin do or the establishment didn't like it so much\nI mean the big department store in Detroit Hudson's for example wouldn't carry it because of some of the outspokenness I mean the FBI investigated this bad ... the FBI file yeah so you know when Cramer talks about his days in the Detroit seen his struggle with drugs and alcohol addiction his time in prison\nIn his memoir and he also talks about his career as a solo artist and music composer for a film and TV\nNow Wayne is currently on tour celebrating fifty years of kick out the gyms and we'd like to welcome to sound opinions Wayne welcome to the show\nThanks guys have happy to be with you all always happy to speak to you to\nWeigh in let's start at the beginning the MC five comes together around a cast of young mayor do well and the Detroit area Fred sonic Smith a guitar with you Michael Davis on base you on guitar and vocals Dennis Thompson on drums and the great\nRob Steiner as to lead vocal is part of what I loved about the MC five is it you guys were not polished specifically ... he had these glasses this weird wild afro he was kind of a chubby your guy he didn't fit the mold of a rock star God like Robert Plant\nNo but he was the world's greatest rock front man yes 'cause he looked like nobody else he sounded like nobody else and he had a a vivid clear vision\nOf the future of rock and and where he wanted to go with it I mean he wore glasses and he had a gap in his teeth and you know this is the big shoulders and this little tiny waste skinny legs and he wasn't like\nDirect from central casting that's for sure we worked hard to develop on an idea about what our band was trying to do and and what our message was and it was a message of self advocacy and self determination\nAnd that you could change the world if you get a phone measures you know if you've kicked out the jams\nHoly and completely you could make something happen [noise]\n\n\n\nIf it forces you know when a lot of fans in the late sixties we're talking about sort of a radical revolution as sort of a sense of cultural upheaval was necessary in the midst of the Vietnam War [noise]\nSpiro Agnew was vice president of our country at that time commission on terrorism and the and the new ... says the band is part of a communist conspiracy to corrupt the youth of America [laughter] way and you're a young guy you're seeing all this stuff getting piled on your head\nOr you're you're on a rock band that does make some noise out of the mid west and suddenly you're on the radar of the vice president United States what was it was a feeling within the band at that time [noise]\nFelt like we were um being fairly effective in disturbed\nThe power structure but clearly used everything they had against us and we ultimately\nWent to court with the Justice Department over the issue of illegal wiretaps they said that they could tap our phones because it was a matter of domestic security\nWhy Africa I wanted to know to what extent he blames the crazy rock and roll scene and the atmosphere of that time for any of the challenges he went through personally with drugs and alcohol\nTo zero extent I I don't I don't blame the arch up for my\nLapses in rational thought or\nOr or principles that's the defects a character that I developed on my own power saw you know I created most of the trouble in my own life and not all of it I I put a fair amount of it or a ride on the doorstep of the war on drugs\nOr which caused me immense anguish over my life and still pains me\nTo see that we have to point three million of our fellow citizens are in prison and in jail and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo obviously policy ... but he went to prison anyway and I ... a barrel cocaine he went for two years of Lexington federal prison in Lexington, Kentucky if you know some people\nTalk about how miserable they weren't prison and it's ... the sense I got to reading your telling of it in the hard stuff\nIs that there were some good stuff that came out of there for you personally you know I don't know rehabilitation has the right word or but there was some learning going on you made good use out of those years that you were in prison [noise] am I reading that correctly\nWhile humans are enormously resilient and able to find value and meaning an enjoyment in the most terrible circumstances\nAnd people in prison do right now as we speak they have the same fears and ambitions as we do out here and in fact we're all the same ... um they made a serious mistake no doubt but um there are still just regular people\nAnd yeah I I was able to to use the time to improve my job skills took advantage of every program that they\nMade available to me and I tried to understand what was wrong with me and what could I Do to make sure I never came back to these penitentiaries again\nMhm [noise] I mean obviously at work you never you didn't end up in prison again um\nWell it worked ... years right yeah I mean I don't believe president helps anybody number I think it may have saved my life because I was doing my worst drinking and drugging in those days and the people I was hanging out with were very dangerous people\nSo it's it's save me in that sense but these are dangerous places where you're never safe or you're embarrassed jury mask elated you are powerless and here in a world of the violence or racism bitterness and defeat\n[noise] and ah nobody out ... better [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nSmashed yelled shark ... you know a sort of the nation\nYou in Philly brag a address idea can we bring music to these people behind bars shit\nWe do is pretty simple we find people that work in corrections that are willing to use music as a tool for rehabilitation today our instruments are in over a hundred and twenty American jails and prisons what we do and besides just supply\nThe instruments is we operate songwriting workshop programs which are self expression programs\nUm where we can help one learn how to express complex\nAnd uncomfortable feelings in a positive way ... you know everybody has the story and everyone's story needs to be told and it's the beginning of the hard work of positive change you know most people in prison\nThey don't like being there and they don't want to be in prison and uh if you give them the tools and the incentive they will make the changes they need to make sure\nThey don't come back should be terrible [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] you know it's\nInteresting because the politics and the arts and the music show there was a it was a huge melting pot of that in in Detroit and [noise] you know you think about back on that here uh it's it's such a collection of characters I mean between the MC five [noise]\nAnd what was happening and Motown which is extraordinary but then you've got you know the the one of us are ... pop telling me or any any chance he got\nHow good the MC five were to him and his band that couldn't get a leg up here was these guys who were made it or we're perceived to be making it\nGiving a hand up to a a a baby band that was trying to find his way you know aids become obviously you're getting used to be an iconic character you guys saw something in that band that you liked obviously\nOh yeah I mean you couldn't deny it she had a complete vision and it was very clear about I mean there were no performers danced with the band and and the rhythm that a pop danced with are still dances with I mean he's one of the great front men of all time um\nUh so yeah of course if or when\nDanny field so does or any other bands around here like the MC five I said no there's no more bands like the MC five Richard ...\n[noise]\nAll you know we were all best friends and we all listened to the same Coltrane and sunrise and we all smoked the same passion we always have the same bologna sandwiches and brown rice and", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "year": "2018", "city":

I hate this ban I don't think it's a good idea to combine email with new\n[laughter] yeah that's that's when it came to my head actually was reason you two or something like that there have been other critics I deeply respect like yourself who have been raving about this record and I feel like I'm the dumbest kid on the block is I don't get it I guess for probably similar reasons to wage and not at all it sounds like a really bloated arena rock rectal you\nYou mentioned eighties yeah this is like something I just hear in the in an arena in the eighties that's what I'm thinking and run for the ... so what am I what am I missing here\nTo me because I've been watching the fan since the beginning the progression is part of what I find so appealing and they they were really shabby at first but clearly had\nA great ambition they ... they sounded like they want it to write for an orchestra and there's something about a few their ability to combine like Ninety the markets are says with\nHuge
