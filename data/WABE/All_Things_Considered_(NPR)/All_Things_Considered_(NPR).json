believed to have killed eleven worshippers at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday he was arraigned in a courtroom in Pittsburgh earlier today\nJulie turkey which has been reporting on his background for the New York times and she joins us now welcome thank you thank you for having me you've been speaking with people who know Robert powers including a childhood friend of his what have you learned from them\nSo most of the people that we've spoken to describe him as very quiet very isolated lived alone he seemed to watch television in the night he used the PO box for not the sort of a mailbox that his apartment which is just south of synagogue\nBut I spoke to a friend of his crew has known him for years and years\nThey went to elementary school together they went to middle school together they went to high school together\nAnd he said that that I'm rubber ... hours as a child was very smart but also seem to really struggle which social cues and the two of them were friends and they would play together they would build things together they would take things apart [noise]\nUh they would build bombs together as sort of pranks and blow up watermelons but as time went on the two of them sort of grew apart and Robert hours became quiet or more isolated\nThen in high school eventually just disappeared and it's not clear if she graduated and it's not clear to this man what happened after that\nPaint a picture for us of his life at this apartment complex the man you portraying your reporting almost seems like a dose like he's not even there\nYeah um so he lived in is sort of low slung apartment building about twenty five minutes south of the synagogue\nAnd the people they're sort of described him as so unremarkable that they didn't even remember his name\nAnd that he was pretty much goes she would come and go\nAnd sometimes disappear for days come back\nGo inside and that was pretty much it\nAnd there's such a contrast between vet demeanor in person and who he was on line tells about the person he was on social media\nYeah so at least in the last year she spent a lot of time on the Internet and he\nNeeded a lot of really terrible things about Jews about immigrants he was clearly very angry\nAnd he seemed to find a like minded community\nOn Gabrielle crucial media network that has become more popular among All right activists among white nationalist people whose views are unwelcome in places like Twitter and Facebook even the president didn't escape his\nAnger and he seems to think that the president had not gone far enough in completing the goals that\nMr Bowers\nAnd can you tell whether those online communities shaped informed Hughes hateful views or whether he just found a home for those pre existing beliefs when he joined these communities\nI don't think that we know enough yet to see that I think ... is one of the things that he's going to come out over the next couple of weeks of the next couple of months as investigators going into his past\nWhat else are you still hoping to learn about him and his motives\nI mean we would certainly like to know more about how did he become as hates\nAs he did and how long has that been going on and what role do Internet playing\nDid the current sort of political anger and conflict playing uh so I Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer finals are going to be going through his home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends\nI kind of thing but Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bauer as the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership or here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack from the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media uh\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any ideas what she does and I know\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price as the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with the without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump are as seemed to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha

I'm Jim Burress\nWhen you go to the doctor's office you get a lot of questions about your safety potentially like did your kids where their bike helmets how do you store your message but very few doctors asked about guns and that might have everything to do with what they learned in medical school\nFor guns in America WABC ease Lisa Hagen reports\nIt's lunchtime at Atlanta's Emery university and about a hundred medical students are busy scarf down their meals in a lecture hall here on their own time to learn about how to talk to a future patients about gun safety for\nOne hour that was

... do you wear your helmet you wear your seatbelt but we just don't talk about firearms\nPublic health groups believe raising patient awareness around the risk of firearms can help reduce gun deaths

border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter dissolves who a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all week old there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or the wrong way to support role again and the plus you've come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States in that law prohibits military from engaging in\nLaw enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not are going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay what's the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border I recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sits in the past it again in a support role\nIn this case you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot\nThese troops who is doing everything to get it from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSoviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public or fears staff and a a good general showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said\nA border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments Pentagon thank you Tom\nYou're welcome in their quest to win back the house of representatives Democrats are focused on twenty five house seats currently held by Republicans in districts that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen\nFlorida Republican Carlos Curbelo is in one of those districts and he's betting that his independent reputation will attract Democrats and Republicans alike NPR's Kelsey Snell reports\nCarlos Curbelo isn't shy about confrontation here is this summer bashing everybody fellow Republicans who backed President Trump's hard line on immigration and Democrats who wouldn't cut a deal with Trump to protect people who were brought to the country illegally as children\nThey prefer the politics the petty politics of immigration instead of the solutions for immigration\nThat took her belly we spent most of the past two years he publicly opposed Trump and Republican leaders on major issues like immigration climate change in trade but he also largely voted tobacco the president's agenda when it comes to health care and tax is\nNow he's running for reelection in a district that Hillary Clinton won by sixteen points and he's running a campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro the man accused of sending more than a dozen package bombs too high profile Democrats critics of President Trump and CNN made his first court appearance today fifty six year old she's our say oc could spend decades behind bars if he's convicted\nDanny Rivera from member station WNPR and was in the courtroom and joins us from Miami Hi Danny\nHey I Know this a court appearance was largely procedural tell us\nWhat happened in court this afternoon\nYeah it was really like you said mostly procedural there wasn't a whole lot of you know guilt or innocence talk I'm basically say up was formally charged on five counts of federal crimes ranging from threatening former presidents\nTo illegal mailings of explosives um remember he was arrested near Miami last friday he'd been driving a white van plastered with anti democratic pro Trump's and anti media stickers and he'd apparently been living out of that band for we don't know exactly how long but for some time\nI'm In court today prosecutors basically said they don't want him to have the option of bill because they consider him a flight risk and danger to other people in the community\nWhat was his demeanor\nSo before the the hearing actually got started he was talking with his attorneys and he was wearing a he was he was shackled at the wrists and ankles and he was wearing a tan jumpsuit\nHe didn't see much um but when he talked he did sound kinda defeated you could hear his his you could barely actually hear his voice at all it was it was quite raspy\n'em before the the proceedings you could I caught a glimpse of him tearing up and looked like his his attorneys kind of gathered around to to shield them from from the view and once that started happening I'm the judge us them a series of questions you know do you understand the charges brought against you if you just kind of not a dummy and he looked\nSomewhat defeated I Would say um [noise] and the\n... yeah and ...\nSorry about that um you could see you could see he was upset at some point you his face kind of turn red who was tearing up his upper lip was quivering um he he didn't look like he was doing too well and\nAnd this was all taking place in southern Florida which is not where his trial is going to take place explained that yeah\nSo the charges were actually filed in the southern district of New York um he was arrested in in my close to Miami so that's where the the original I'm hearing is taking place but he will at some point be taken up to to New York\nUh the U.S attorney there is the one prosecuting the case of many of the package bombs\nWere mailed there in that office has a long history of prosecuting these kinds of crimes\nUm the the trial itself I wouldn't bet on it happening anytime soon these cases tend to take years or even longer to go to to to trial if there is no plea deal\nI'm In the meantime the next hearing the the judge said it's going to be on friday here in Miami so he'll beer here at least until then and at that point we'll learn whether he'll be released on bail\nOr if you're going to be transferred up to New York for for more hearings\nRight that is Danny Rivera reporter with member station WFCR in in South Florida thanks very much standing\nThanks for having me\nWe're going to take the next few minutes to remember to be eleven people killed at the tree of life synagogue on Saturday\nTwo brothers inseparable and devoted to their synagogue Cecil and David Rosenthal Cecil was fifty nine five years older than David the brothers live together in a community home in Pittsburgh run by achiever that's an organization that helps people with disabilities\nChris show ... is vice president of residential supports with achieve it and she joins me now via Skype to remember the Rosenthal brothers a crush of welcome and I'm On my condolences on your last I'm so sorry\nFor uncle ... that\nDescribe Cecil and David for me what were they like\nGay and fulfill were larger than life\nRight or a terror that are ... ... ... worth selling trying to the fabric of their lives to rock throwers or hell they would stop and talk to her every line an adult wine\nAnd I read that she had an official role he was a greeter at the synagogue\nFaced were hot only a greater than that I Would refer to him as far back fitter to throw hell he was always ... how are you gay and\nLive a very reserves her thing finishing that her letter today that he just opened up they were so close to their family day\nTo call his mother every single day when he got home from work\nThey got up with a positive attitude\nHow's your family how're you doing what your day look like for today blessings free today and they threw parties for everything in fact one time they had their bathrooms remodeled in their home and they wanted to throw a party for remodeling the bathroom [laughter]\nTrying to imagine that one and and and then\nThere was a next door neighbor where they had that house remodeled and they were going to put it on the market and they went to the open house because they wanted to be a part of that\nYeah what kind of work today do you describe them coming home from work\nDavid Was working for good well and cleaning and see if there was about to start a job today is awake and a family owned\nBusiness has it taken a toll on your staff who worked with them and help them for for all these years\nYes to them at such an early age excuse\nAnd they and they are such a vital part of their family our family so it is extremely difficult now\nI'm so sorry part of what also must be difficult is letting all your other clients all the other people who rely on achieve a no how are you talking them through this\n[noise] myself and another staff member went out yesterday to me with housemates so people who are down to offer them and explanation as best we can about the events of Saturday\nAnd to offer any support we are also going to offer people kind of a service where people can come and share their memories and their failings\nSo you're planning some kind of gathering within your organization to honor and remember them absolutely and it sounds like these are two brothers who like to party who would have appreciated that gesture and been right there in the mix\nI think that is exactly correct I think that on Saturday she could have counted them to be where they were\n[noise] that's where they wanted to have been the best way that we can remember them an honor then is to know that they live their life well anybody you talked to in ... new them they were well respected in their church and their family is absolutely fantastic\nAnd it's one of the best situations that could ever be\nThat's for sure with achiever talking about David and

will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia you may have hurt other colleagues some NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling and talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties\nWe decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of that and blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Wisconsin the Democrats thought would secure the White House for them and all of those states went for Trump on election night now though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house\nSo we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them what's on what's on their minds this election year had help us understand what we've been hearing we ask WHYY Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered a pumpkin bread and cookies insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally they've Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and Allen Say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nThis is a seismic shift in the politics of this state mean for the last six years Pennsylvania's ... have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shape and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenge last year and a lawsuit there was aimed not in federal court where some of the gerrymandering suits have stalled but at state court and in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map or an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to\nAnd immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that name off\nWho will spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know Michelle it's just character assassination if you have ever mister tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated and amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money it's been one of the most expensive campaigns in the country in a lot of that has to do\nWith the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but was also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Bryant that's Patrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott Wallace was never run for office before and he's poured millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary are\nNot just the policies that are being twisted around and and turned toward the one percent on the corporations\nAnd away from the Ninety nine percent but just the moral tone of our country I've got three kids are going to raise a kid in this atmosphere this influence coming from the White House\nIt's destructive of the fabric of our moral core in America and destructive of democracy the assaults on the media the assaults on the courts and the rule of law and the FBI on our intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and all very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of it here\nThe on a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue that ties all of us together is money in politics\nOut about it pretty much of a ... really\nDo you know if you know of anyone who was hurt\nI I don't uh unfortunately this on uh as far as I Know are they still have not been able to notify the families of those who have died and so uh so so far nobody knows\nWhat you tell us about the congregation what kind of cynical I wasn't what stands out from your\nBut all the same ... tree of life a was a combination of two synagogues in Pittsburgh emerged to conservative synagogue to really lovely welcoming place um it's in the heart of squirrel hill which is\nA central part of the Jewish community a lot of the population of George Pittsburgh and ... just a wonderful warm and welcoming place\n[noise] and and I wanted to ask you about this this has to just strike at your core\nAnd forgive me this news is so fresh you probably haven't haven't had time to process it but I I just wonder what's going to your mind at a at a time like this I mean did you did this ... strike at your sense of safety as an American as an American Jew I just I'm just wondering how you are processing this\nReally a I'm a shock does anybody in this community you know the truth is that\nAh we're lucky in Pittsburgh but generally the Pittsburgh Jewish community is a one of the safest Jewish communities in the United states um we've had a community security director for a couple of years has really been improving\nSecurity at the synagogue in that church agencies and so this comes as even more of a shock to me and everybody here\n[noise] how do you think you'll process to spend the next couple of days\nThat it's hard to tell him we are having a a community gathering or tomorrow at five PM oh that's a\nReally all of the synagogues and in Pittsburgh are participating and I think\nIn my mind it's time to come together joined together as a community I feel like a Jewish Pittsburgh has a family and so this attack really does feel like a an attack on my own family\nAnd and finally how how can others in the community support you I'm\nSure there are many grieving with who are not Jewish what what can they do to support you at this time\nWe've had an amazing outpouring of support both from the church community and the non Jewish community all over Pittsburgh or even now you know just a\nA couple of hours after this\nTerrible incidents um local businesses came out with food for our grief center and gotten tax than emails from churches I think that uh\nYou know the best thing to do is to come together and help the community he'll some if people want to give we're going to open an aftershock bought a closes a fund for victims of terror and uh they can certainly contribute\nTo that I'm sure she read it there for now Mr Huntsman thank you so very much for speaking with us it's such a sensitive time I think he's still very much and thank you this is NPR

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the FBI is on the ground there helping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here with us now to tell us more hello Brian Tyler\nFirst of all what can you tell us about the gunman at this point\nUh well we don't know a whole lot about 'em at this point he's been identified a as Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh resident or in terms of how this investigation is going to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today a here's what he had to say about how this is going to move forward\nAnd or the next several days and weeks we will look at everything and the suspects life is home his vehicle is social media and his movements over the last several days\nUh Jones says officers recovered and assault rifle and three hand guns at the scene a when a agents are gonna searches home they say that they'll take precautions that case there might be any sort of explosive devices there\nHe says the FBI does not believe at this point uh the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement for today says uh and he also says that the suspects full motive at this point is unknown but then of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhat the president has call this an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at this as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off yes attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime or hate crimes and other criminal charges or in this case he says that there's no place for hatred and violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district of Pennsylvania Scott Brady he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but we're gonna have to wait and see what all those ... charges are going to entail\nAnd could you tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight and in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular nature of of the crime in a case like this a a former federal prosecutor tells me that it's likely wouldn't change that much\nBecause this sort of crime with eleven people killed uh the the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania does have a stake death penalty although it hasn't been used in in quite some time\nBut treating the shooting and prosecuting it as a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and that the federal government treats it as such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof\nOf who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina the federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and\nUltimately a federal jury convicted him and he uh he was sentenced to death\nAnd just as recently as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence there are there's lab work to be done and then of course\nThey get into the or the alleged shooter's social media history there already accounts reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiment a and the alleged shooter in this case is of course eleven in custody so possibly looking to question him\nThat is NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan thank you so much for talking to us thank you\nAnd once again we are broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia that is where we were when we got the terrible news of the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd this in a week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race\nAnd pipe bombs were sent to a prominent figures apparently because of their political views but even before those awful events we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us they are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility",

chances NPR's Tovia Smith reports on the new effort to keep students safe\nOne of the first things colleges are doing is teaching students to recognize an opioid overdose\nAnd what to do things and you know\nOhio University is using this video dramatization you just show how ... can that drug known generically as a lock sound can reverse in overdose newly\nOhio University is one of many schools

bottles of ... sprayed all clearly labeled and read as opioid overdose kits and all free for the taking\nWe felt that it was on the university to provide these because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the midst of an epidemic that affects everybody\nShortly after a student died of an overdose in two thousand sixteen police putting our can in every norm in parking lot and trained more than a thousand people to administer it\nAll you do you feel this facts you would hold it like this the tip into the patients natural\nAbout regarding an inch down into the nasal passage when he was just

says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects during his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools were set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nThey didn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but I mean it was probably blatantly obvious honestly I was it was pretty bad\nNews this is all things considered I Know the Chang and I'm Audie Cornish President Trump declared over the weekend that the U.S is pulling out of the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty now president Ronald Reagan signed this treaty with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the White House thirty one years ago\nBut the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction in this case the complete elimination of an entire trash of us and Soviet nuclear missiles\nHere with me now to discuss why this treaty is no longer acceptable to another Republican president as NPR national security correspondent David Welna welcome to the studio coyote okay so the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty or we can call it the INS what does this treaty actually do\nWell you know this was signed in the Nineteen eighties when the U.S in the Soviet Union had nuclear tipped missile deployed along the periphery of Eastern Europe and they could reach their targets in only eight minutes which left almost no time for any response it was a very dangerous situation which neither the U.S nor the Soviet Union wanted to continue\nAnd so the treaty requires the destruction of all these intermediate range land base nuclear missiles once and for all and it really was the beginning of the end of the Cold War\nNow President Trump says Russia has not been in compliance with the treaty do we know if this is true\nWell you know U.S officials beginning with President Obama four years ago have been saying that Russia's been cheating on this treaty\nThat Russia's been deploying some land base intermediate range cruise missiles that could strike targets in Eastern Europe in violation of the treaty but Obama did not want to kill this arms control treaty figuring that it's so provided a means for talking with the Russians at least\nOf course Ronald Reagan a Republican hero right to the party what is the difference in philosophy here why we're seeing this president President Trump determined to pull out of the treaty\nWell you know Trump does not like international agreements he's already pulled out of the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal\nI think this really shows that the Russia hawks and the administration are getting their way and it's not the state department is doing this even though that's traditionally where such policies are carried out this bears the hallmarks of national security adviser John Bolton\nHe's never liked arms control deal he wrote in two thousand eleven that the u._s. should leave the treaty and Bolton is in Moscow today and tomorrow delivering that message what's been the response from the Russian government\nAre

be here I'll say how controversial is this in the art world for a ...\nThe painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we can set our art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine all by Marcel Just shop where he literally took them then you're in on hanging on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what art actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well\nThey still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere ... really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the ... who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the color is the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated artwork hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened\nBecause this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale\nI

Georgia's population was growing\nThe black death to kill off asserted the state's\nAbout population\nWe had to be something else going on\nSo here's what's happening to bond earns missing voters states routinely purge hundreds of thousands of people from their voter registration rolls these are people who've died or moved away or gone to prison but Georgia and at least eight other states have what you could call use it or lose it laws not voting can get you removed from the rolls\nIt works like this if you sit out a couple of elections you can get put on an inactive list the state send you a mailer if you don't respond and get to more federal elections your perch and if you don't know your removed you may show up at your polling place only to find out you can't vote\nUnder camp there's

you know having secure lessons you gotta have secure voter rolls\nKemp says he's made it easier to vote by setting up online registration but during his time in office there's been a big jump in the number of people who've been removed from the rolls more than one point six million have had their registration cancelled [noise]\nLanding on my mind [noise]\nI decided to try and find people who've been purged without knowing it in Moultrie the small agricultural town in southern Georgia\nThere's some concerns over there [noise]\nAnd with Angela ... she's an investigative reporter from a PM reporting as we've got to sort of guide a database with the names and addresses of all five hundred thousand or so people purged in Georgia last year\nAnd our analysis shows that in the county where Moultrie is any more than two dozen others the purchase are disproportionately affecting people of color\nRan in Wayne\nMoultrie if the county seat we pass white column homes with manicured lawns and lush magnolias in front on the other side of town we drive over potholes streets along rows of one story ramshackle houses and [noise]\nWhen we get to the homes of people who are listed is perhaps some are boarded up and the residents have moved away at some of the other addresses we're told the people were looking for have gone off to college or the military and\nI Am this woman tells us she doesn't vote for religious reasons\nI like the mayor and you\nStill looking for someone who wants to vote in November but doesn't know they've been purged so we go to see Cornelius ponder a member of Moultrie city council hey how you doing but he's also a businessman and pastor\nThe real church that stands for restoration and if ... and love\nHe says his family's lived in the area for generations it's my great grandparents uh it was small sharecroppers Reverend ponder won his election last year by the slimmest of margins just nine votes she says well he was campaigning he encountered people who've been purged for failing to vote in previous elections\nI came across all quite a few people then that led to an Iranian some of them went down to vote\nAnd they could and then um I have two people say that they got down there and they didn't have proper documentation anytime there's confusing like that during the election is not good\nHe says with Trump in office enthusiasm is low in Moultrie in the last election voter turnout was below ten percent voters are also frustrated with all the obstacles purges confusion over polling locations and long lines\nThe racist they don't like is no longer more devoted now and I think that's what we're we're we're in trouble with\nVan Angela asks about a name she spotted on the purge list\nKathleen Parker oh yeah yeah yeah he won't pressurized so she's\nNot Steve record say Kathleen ponder registered to vote in two thousand eight then earlier this year official struck her name from the rolls Reverend ponder tells us he doesn't know about any of this but does he and know that she's been taken off the boating list [noise]\nAngela and I find ms ponder living in a small house just outside multiply\nThat famous signed\nHi I'm Angela completely I'm a reporter with public radio Senator John and\nOn a story about people who send removed from the voter last I don't know if you've heard about this but\nAngela explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rules at a disproportionate rates\nSo you registered to vote in two thousand and eight years I've heard that Obama is trying to remember a hand\nYou know to vote for him or are there for it or anything [noise]\nSo then I last July you were taken off the voter lists I Would have been on July twenty eighth as twenty Seventeen hands but you didn't get any notification that you\nNeed ... you know\nDid you know there there is a policy that they take us if you don't\n\nMiss ... says she had no idea she'd been perch although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey Abrams for Governor Rhodes will be able to do back at Reverend ponders office angel it gives him the news about his aunt\nShe still lives within the county but she's been removed from the voter last and she had no idea ...\nThat's interesting is she was never notify or anything\nShe doesn't recall ever getting anything from election officials\n[noise] well I think we need to get down to the bottom of it because if it happened to her to Rome and she she ...\nShe says it just confirms his view that voter suppression is happening\nIt almost give people the red mindset that this is a privilege not right and so now anything that is a privilege as they get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nHe says he'll take his aunt to re register so she can vote in the governor's race [noise]\nWe analyze all the people perjuring Georgia just last year and we found that about a hundred thousand removed for not voting and not responding to notices\nNow we don't know how it breaks down by race but if you add in other obstacles like a voter id law enclosed polling places all this could tip a close race for governor\nWhen it comes to the perjury is Stacey Abrams and other Democrats said there's a solution let people register all the way to election day\nAt least Seventeen states have same day registration but not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nStates where you have same day registration it leads to irrational voting\nBrian Robin ... is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house brands he's voting as a writer and a privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is outright period\nBrian thanks registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's that administrative headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate\nA bad idea ... how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss on all that but if you don't know an October the first so there's a presidential election or a gubernatorial election in uh the first two weeks of November\nYou're not an informed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike if if the presidential election and it back to presidential elections don't get you out I don't know what it's going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's a fair standard", "show_name":

Northern Ireland being part of the u._k.\nAnd so they can't agree though exactly where to put it elsewhere who would have run that border that sort of thing and that's what's holding everything up\nAnd it's really frustrating because everybody felt that this week was the week they had to come to a deal in order to get enacted before brags that happens on march twenty ninth of next year slow prime minister Peter ... captured the dire or our mood as it were the best\nSaying he's usually an optimistic person but not today\nMy hope was that today we will have already some for a solution on the table but it looks like it'd be a deal\nBut he and other leaders are saying that they're keeping an open mind\nWhat about some of the British prime minister she's still sounding optimistic\nI well I Would say she's the cheerleader today I mean she says that the u._k. position is still on the table she feels that they're getting close a but she wouldn't say whether she's presenting any new proposals which the e council president Donald Tusk and other leaders want\nThat seems to be with a very hard in order to ensure that we see dress seized issues of what we've seen is that we sold most of the issues in withdrawal agreement of ... and she knows the time to make you tough [noise]\nShe also wouldn't say or what she thought about extending the transition period the u._k. would have to leave the ... which is something that sunny you leaders including the Irish prime minister we're talking about elaborate\nOn that I mean what would that mean to extend the transition period after Britain leaves the you\nWell right now the agreement is more or less that ah when the u._k. leads on twenty ninth of march next year\nThat basically until the thirty first of December the following year another was twenty twenty or economic and trade deals between the u._k. and you would remain unchanged and now they're talking about extending yet another full year in order to increase the chance of negotiating a full treaty\nAnd meanwhile hanging over all of this is the specter of a Britain might leave you without a new might just crush out yeah and that's something that everyone is is quite worried about um besides the fact you'd have snarled borders and\nPrice hikes for good or is it will be a problem for a lot of the countries including Germany for example were analysts say that the cost could exceed a hundred and Fifteen billion dollars if there is a hard brags that as it were\nA hundred and fifty billion while and fierce arrests are hard enough and reporting from Brussels thank you sir oh You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for the British and European economies and for the U.S George Parker has written about this he's a political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following those negotiations welcome back to the program hello [noise]\nIf there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty nine when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a tightly held chicken acrimonious no deal where\nEverybody ended up throwing plates and each other in person left to you in very bad don't you and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts of the border say you would have a immediate you'd have to check some old goods coming in and out to the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment that will quickly to huge queues to the ports coming into person\nAnd very quickly the companies in person which rely on a seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very chaotic and damaging ... for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nThere's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool\nIt will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you ... the place where there are ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the pool so\nPretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate says what would happen in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red type out the borders and that without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHit ... sort of an aircraft crunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person will be a poor placing otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some ... percent of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European ... so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's somewhat and they won produces in France cop produces in Germany\nAnd you name it they will they will be effective because you pay off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that some of the European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from a deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all quite at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago\nThe differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does a deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy bucking London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... still despite all the negative noises around is that common sense will prevail and that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always a pleasure

the options\nThis is what South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News for that would do I know what I'm going to do on fashion the hell out of Saudi Arabia of course Senator Graham can't impose sanctions on his own but there are quite a few Democrats and Republicans in Congress already calling for unity of measures\nFor more on this we're joined by NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre ... hey Ari President Trump could impose sanctions is there any sign that he would do this either on his own or with Congress\nAt this point no everything that he said and he's address this several times as recently as today has been\nThe Saudis are denying this we're not going to make them guilty until proven innocent he's stressing that Saudi Arabia is an ally part of this us coalition against Iran\nSo if he maintains that position the overall response is is us response is likely to be quite mild but Congress in private business can can do a lot and could forces hands in some ways you say that\nCould do a lot what specific sorts of things might they do well\nFor example the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has to sign off on arms deals and and for the past year they've really sort of been raising a bit of a stink about the way Saudi Arabia has been conducting his war in Yemen with with us munitions and us up planes\nOr if any new big arms contracts came before them they could block it there aren't any at the moment but they could do that um we had the the Russian example last year were Congress overwhelmingly approved sanctions against Russia and then the the president was really forced to accept them\nSomething related to to the so called Magnitsky Act where which which Congress infected vote just last week so the president now has four

prince Mohammed bin Salman was here touring\nA who's who of American companies Google and apple and Lockheed are trying to attract them they may now shy away from South\nSo those are a lot of diplomats are there's a lot of economic uh options what about diplomatic possibilities what steps could the U.S take there\nReally two things I think to to keep an eye and one is this war in Yemen the Saudis are heavily dependent on the usa fly\nF. Fifteen ... airplanes to to carry out airstrikes\nUnited States supplies the weapons the maintenance the training if the U.S threatened in any way to to limit that cooperation that would severely restrict the way that the Saudis could carry out that that war and there'd been high civilian casualties and that's something the U.S could ...\nThe Saudis on if they so chose\nThe other is this boycott of Qatar Saudi Arabia's neighbor well Qatar is a very wealthy country it's also a close us ally a major us airbase there um and and so that\nUh is something the U.S could could stress and say hey play nice with Qatar we want these are all we're both were all in this together um let's let's end that boycott\nOut Saudi Arabia reacting to the possibility of the sanctions would their response likely be\nWell they they came out this week and said that they would respond with greater action if if some sorts of punitive measures are imposed on them um they could always pump less oil and try to drive up prices although that goes very much against their the way they've always done business\nUm interesting factoid or the Energy Department announced just last month the U.S has surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's leading oil producer\nAbout eleven ... million barrels per day so Saturday El Al is just not as important as it is it used to be a but this uh this ... is a reminder that relations are often strain the thing you often hear when talking about a U.S in Saudi Saudi Arabia's these are countries that share that share interests not values\nNPR's Greg Myre we thank you thank you\nYesterday President Trump compared the ... case to the debate over Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh said both are cases of quote guilty until proven innocent\nDuring that confirmation debate the Supreme Court justices themselves largely kept quiet now the Kavanaugh is on the court chief justice John Roberts is speaking publicly trying to make sure that the bitter fight doesn't cast a shadow over the high court\nI Will not criticized the political branches we do that often enough in our opinions\nBut what I Would like to do briefly is emphasized how the judicial branch is how it must be very different\nTo chief justice gave that audience at the University of Minnesota law school a defective civics lesson about the role of the Supreme Court in American democracy\nOur role is very clear we are to interpret the constitution and laws of the United states\nAnd ensure that the political branches act within them that job obviously requires\nIndependence from the political branches the story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence\nRoberts highlighted some of the difficult decisions the court made that ran contrary to popular political opinions of the day and Roberts said when the court has made mistakes it is because the court gave in to political pressure for example the Korematsu ruling that upheld internment of Japanese Americans during world\nWar two he shared a tradition the justices have one that's designed to reinforce their shared commitment to working together despite ideological differences\nBefore we go on to the bench to hear argument and the case in before we go into the conference room to discuss the case we pause for a moment and shake each other's hand it's a small thing perhaps but it is they repeated reminder\nAs our newest colleagues put it we do not sit on opposite sides of an ...\nWe do not serve one party or one interest we serve one nation and I want to assure all of you that we will continue to do that\nTo the best of our abilities whether times are called or contentious\nJohn Roberts chief justice of the United states speaking yesterday in Minnesota [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nUh Florida has some of the toughest building codes in the country but certain areas are exempted from rules that would protect against storms like hurricane Michael that story coming up later on all things considered on Ninety point one W.

Canadians want to enter the U.S\nGiven that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states\nSaying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all in the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to Lynn Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past campus use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on so you listen to that\nWhole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse this out there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burn somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where are you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing you rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking it was like somebody's trying to get in in the inside doors shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was\nShaking I thought just hang in there and I said everything was going to be okay\nFor when last doors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone\nThe storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite few gate is the former head of FEMA and a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nI mean this is a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida it's not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational a floor families any of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade and Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state in some north Florida communities new construction need only withstand when speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm has local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael impact\nWhat we were damaged it pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of what was not damaged houses that were well educated\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig view gate has long believed wind speeds standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that store back in and out particularly yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher in ... ... or the coast well inland based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and his awaiting recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide provide says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can be proven over such as it is a way that she is willing to adopt it or not\nRealtors homebuilders the insurance industry and many others will have a voice as Florida

News I'm Kathleen clearly in\nThree children in Georgia have come down with a rare polio light condition the CDC says they are among sixty two children to contract the illness nationwide there's no single known cause for the illness called acute slash in my lettuce symptoms include weakness in the arms or legs and sometimes paralysis\nYes exactly and from these reports we know that Saudi Arabia has spent about Nineteen million dollars on influence campaigns here in the U.S since the beginning of two thousand Seventeen and nine million this year alone\nThis year alone and twenty two yet and able to track the far can we tell what they are trying to buy without money what policy outcomes Saudi Arabia might be trying to achieve\nTo a certain extent based on what is in the disclosures you can tell broad narratives of what they are trying to influence\nOkay and so in the case of Saudi Arabia where some of the answers and who are who are they trying to lobby\nSo in two thousand Seventeen they contacted every single senator as well as those who are on the appropriations committees the foreign affairs committees and the armed Services Committee is multiple times those who\nAre directly making the decisions about whether or not arms deals multibillion dollar arms deals are going to go through with the government\nBut the other side of it is a massive public relations campaign and that's very much focus on\nPushing Saudi Arabia's reform agenda and portraying them as a valuable ally within the middle east and that what they're doing in Yemen is not only to benefit the U. S. but also the Yemen itself\nI imagine there's also contracts that you can follow tracing Saudis reaching out to lobbyists who they want to reach out to the private sector or for talking ...\nYes so a great example of that is um one of the lobbying groups that Saudi Arabia hired recently was founded by\nHoward Buck McKeon who was the former chairman of the house armed services committee and one of their other clients is Lockheed Martin which is one of the defense contractors that sells arms to Saudi Arabia fairly regularly\n[noise] I also mentioned think tanks and have those donations and grants those are a little bit harder to track explain why\nExactly so the foreign agents registration act is not well enforced by the department of justice they rely on a policy of voluntary compliance and they haven't really clarified what activities in relationships are covered by the law\nI think tanks have traditionally not been required to register under the foreign agents registration act\nThere is a rule in the house that when non governmental witnesses particularly think tank experts are asked to testify they have to file what are known as truth in testimony forms in which they have to disclose any foreign funding received within the last two years as it relates to the subject of the hearing\nUnfortunately have the as it relates to the subject of the hearing has ended up being very narrowly interpreted so\nFor instance a hearing on Iranian backed militias which has a table of experts from I think tanks who specializes in Middle Eastern policy and receive millions of dollars from governments like Saudi Arabia Qatar and United Arab Emirates\nWhich really do have an interest in this topic they'll undisclosed\nSo this is a long standing practice of countries such as the kingdom of Saudi Arabia providing grants or other donations to big think tanks are that are influential what are you doing it thanks so much for stopping by thank you for having me she's an investigator with the project on government oversight\nPresident Trump often criticizes people he has appointed two top jobs in the government lately he's going after someone who sets monetary policy\nThat going on what is the fed because the fed is ranging rage too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing\nThat was Trump attacking Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on the Fox Business Network last night there is a history of tension between the White House and the ... and NPR's re Berliner joined us to tell us more about this ... hello or let's start with what's happening right now why is the president going after the chairman of the Federal Reserve\nWill back in July he said he wasn't happy with the food rate hikes he suggested that the good interfere with the economic expansion and then more recently right after the stock market so off you complain again the some a lot more strenuously you said the ... gone crazy\nWas out of control then yesterday he dug up even more saying the fed was his biggest threat\nNow the president's been criticized for these attacks including by some former members of the fed you know they say this can create political pressure that interferes with the feds independence but others say you know the fed is fair game and should really be able to defend his policies if they get criticized\nYet we heard of that tape Trump saying well the fed is independent so I'm not going to attack them but they're crazy out of control the biggest threat he's not the first president to attack the Federal Reserve tell us more about the history here\nYeah that's true or not it hasn't happened up so much recently but you know back when Lyndon Johnson was president he clashed with his fed chairman William ... this was in Johnson was spending a lot on anti poverty programs and the Vietnam War\nMartin was a fiscal conservative and he famously said the Fed's job was to take away the punch bowl just as the party is getting going so they didn't get along and in Nineteen sixty five LBJ some and Martin to his ranch in Texas for a stern talk\nAccording to Martin's oral history LBJ said to him Martin my boys are dying in Vietnam and you won't print the money I Need\nAnd then it was Richard Nixon Nixon pressured fed chairman Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the run up to the Nineteen Seventy two election or the first President Bush he didn't criticize Alan Greenspan publicly when he was president but years later when he was out of office he said he thought Greenspan cost him his reelection\nSo it sounds like President Trump who's known for violating norms is keeping with a long established an army or is there anything different about these attacks happening\nNow his rhetoric not surprisingly how blunt it is also it's been very public ah you know I Can't also think of any other president who said the fed is crazy\nOr what when presidents are unhappy with the fed is almost always for the same reason presidents ... lower rates easier credit flowing through the economy\nThat can boost growth and not coincidentally make presence more popular but I can also lead to inflation presidents don't often worry about inflation central banks do however that's part of their job so there can be this inherent tension between the fed and the White House that can really pick up during an election year\nRight it's independent but also serves kind of at the pleasure of the president is there any chance of Jerome Powell getting fired by President Trump\nThere's no indication of that the fed is supposed to be protected from politics and politicians Donald Trump has acknowledged that he's the one who appointed Powell and that the fed is independent but the fed is really seemed to have gotten the fed is really seem to have gotten under your skin to NPR's Uri Berliner thanks for joining us today You're welcome [laughter]\nIt's all things considered from NPR

that it's really telling he described the effect of the state run narratives and he calls you know people victims of the majority of the population believe it but I think there's something bigger going on here there's this is about the way Saudis especially young Saudis see the crown prince Mohammed bin someone\nWill stay with that for a second to you that we've been talking about how the press is covering most is it possible to gauge how ordinary Sal to use a are following this\nYou can see some reactions social media is where you see it shock disbelief fear you know when the crown prince he's known as NBS and the kingdom first came to power he built this cult of personality was young he was dynamic\nAnd young Saudis it and that's a huge part of the population\nThey saw him as one of them they based would say we love him he got them and he said he would transferred the country and in some ways he did his rained in the religious police he's permitted women to drive into work he's reopen movie theaters all of that is a really big deal\nThe new Saudi Arabia got all this great coverage it was suddenly cool to be a Saturday\nBut now the country is getting this relentless

days a week in this media environment\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly in TV commercials and on debate stooges across America the attacks are now blistering as candidates the election day coming up fast the kind of policies congressman O'Rourke Iraq supports high taxes high\nRegulations open borders they just voted five times to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits it was disgusting way of seeing the mob rule in Washington DC\nEvery single one of us is in this together this is one of the most important election of our lifetime and we all\nNational political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us to talk about what both parties are doing to gain an edge in this final stretch before the midterm tomorrow Hi there Hi so start with the issues there's all kinds of things that could be weighing on voters' minds these last three weeks of the the Kavanaugh hearings the\nPresident's a campaign rallies constant campaign rallies developments at the border of crisis with Saudi Arabia [noise]\nCan we say whether any of those seem to be shifting the playing field\nThey are not there might have been a kind of cabinet bump but the most important thing to remember about these last two weeks in the election is that the fundamentals haven't changed much at all the house still looks pretty good for Democrats not sure if it's good enough for them to get the net twenty three pick up seats that they need which they don't they need Senate\nMap looks excellent for Republicans that always has that's because there are a lot of Senate Democratic incumbents in very red states where Donald Trump is very popular\nWe know the Democrats are more energized this year Republicans are becoming more energized as they always do in October we're also seeing signs that they we might have a very high turnout mid term election which is pretty rare\nUh people are self reporting a lot of enthusiasm about voting we've seen record turnouts in primaries and special election and what's the\nClosing argument that both parties are settling on\nWell the closing argument from Republicans who began thinking that the tax cut bill and the booming economy would boost them but as the tax cuts got less popular they're closing argument is now warning voters\nThat Democrats will take away the tax cuts\nPut regulations back on the economy wrecked the economy there kind of reverting to the Trump culture war issues which do energize their base\nTalking about hordes of criminal illegal aliens coming to kill people and I'm looking at a fundraising pitch from Mimi Walters Republican congresswoman from California who says we just learned that my socialist pro tax opponent out raised us\nWe can't let the Democrat mob take over Congress how Democrats on the other hand have stuck to health care\nWhich is the number one issue for voters this year except for their refining a little bit they're now saying Republicans gave tax cuts to the rich created a huge deficit and to close that whole they are going to come and cut your Medicare and Social Security\n[noise] may I ask you the flip side of a closing argument question which is what's the biggest challenge for each party at this point what's what's keeping Republicans up at night what's keeping Democrats up at night as election day closer than\nAre worried about the mid west this is the the area of the country where Trump really one Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania\nThey thought those states would turn red they thought oh Iowa and Ohio would no longer be swing states they'd be solidly red but they are really struggling in the mid west the next two weeks will tell us whether that's true so they're worried about exciting their base\nIn the industrial heartland a Trump and another problem for Republicans as the Trump kept telling his supporters there is a red wave and borders believed him and got a little complacent and we\nThat anger is the best motivator and we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his big when the president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nOh All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you [laughter]\nNow for all the focus on how the Democratic party shifting to the left nationally\nIf Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district\nIt is in deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat Ben McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year of deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump how do you view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for the country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress that I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump me a love for two term congresswoman who got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican\nLove is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly one morning when I build\nA relationship on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nShe was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slur to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong\nAnd worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes and actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judge based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat from McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keeps his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me when their elections and these are people from party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams that many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift they aren't calling for single payer health care\nHe meant so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderate ships party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back power got Detrow NPR News Salt Lake city [noise]\nAnd you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n[noise] hey this is David Draine here and I want to tell you that there is a big

president Woodrow Wilson ... active\nDuty troops to the border during the Mexican revolution just stop raiders from coming across into border states but today we're talking about families with small children seeking asylum their longstanding federal laws that give protection to immigrants who qualify as refugees they have the right to cross at legal ports of entry and ask for asylum\nWhether troops could be said to the international bridges to block them as an interesting question the policy come Titus act prevents the military from being used for civilian law enforcement\nIt's interesting that the the most relevant precedent to eh you're saying that you have to go back a hundred years took to Woodrow Wilson right let me let me ask you this the Trump Administration frames all of this in terms of crisis that the situation at the border as a crisis and sell appropriate measures are required\nIs the situation at the border right now a crisis\nWell a homeland security spokesperson told me that they're compiling the urine figures right now and she says the numbers of immigrant families arriving in order will likely break records on a monthly basis and now it's important to keep this in context Mary Louise because back in two thousand they were arresting one and a half\nMillion undocumented immigrants a year so far this year it's been under four hundred thousand but still the Trump Administration is upset and frustrated they continued to blame everything on Congress for allowing what they called catch and release loopholes in the law\nThe d._a. just spokesman told me that the agency is examining all options to secure the border\nAnd when that spokesperson talks about all options family separation is back on the table this policy that was so controversial that the president had to walk back and and reverse it when they tried that earlier this year\nAnd so now homeland security is considering a new sort of watered down form of family separation but also to act as a deterrent to families thinking about crossing up such as those in the caravan uh right now here's the president on the south lawn of the weekend\nIf they fail this separation in many cases they don't set\nOf course as the case that the administration made when they rolled out the family separation policy right earlier this year or so what what a watered down version look\nLike well they're talking about something called a binary choice detained families with their children would have two options one they could give their kids up to a government use shelter where the kids would eventually be sponsored by a relative or a foster family who are already here in the U.S\nAn option to they could keep their kids with them in detention indefinitely\nUntil their asylum cases resolved currently of court rulings says the kids can't be locked up with their parents for more than three weeks right as this would extend vat and immigrant advocates are appalled here's Michelle brane a of the women's refugee commission on a call with reporters yesterday\nCleared it ... it's a binary choice\nPolicy that the administration is considering punish and a church family is from taking protect this\nRound of the administration's handling separation policy\nJohn Burnett round two or watered down whatever we want to call this revisiting a family separation the same challenges are there right I mean for example if they want to ramp up the tension of immigrant families the question of where they would put all these families\nRight and of course the binary choice is still being considered it's not policy yet but if they put it into practice the question is where would they detain all these families currently there are a little over three thousand spots for family members and what are called special family residential centers\nBut you're talking about thousands of these immigrant families that are arrested every week at the southwest border these days um the government doesn't have enough detention beds so for the foreseeable future you'll see the continuation of families\nBeing arrested their process for a few days and then most are released with ankle monitors with their kids to show up for immigration court and that's what's been the doubling the Trump Administration\nAll along NPR's John Burnett reporting thank you John you bet Mary Louise\nInterior secretary Ryan Zinke has been one of the most controversial members of President Trump's cabinet there are numerous investigations into his conduct a secretary when the day began there were reports that he was planning to replace the independent watchdog leading some of those investigations\nThat department now says that's not happening and parents ... reports\nIt all started with an email from housing secretary Ben Carson telling her the employees that Suzanne Israel tops HUD assistant secretary for administration was leaving that agency to become acting inspector general at the department of interior\nThis came as a surprise to many in Washington perhaps even to the current acting inspector general Mary candle\nFor one thing inspectors general are appointed by the president and the White House hadn't announced anything and lose Hempel which of the project on government oversight to Tufts didn't have the experience that would qualify her to be an inspector general\nIndividual that really should be non political issues that oversight experience they should have an investigative background that kind of crime them for that kind of watched outlaw\nTops is a former Trump campaign aide who was brought to hug by Carson to replace the staffer who blew the whistle on Carson's plans to use taxpayer dollars to buy a thirty one thousand dollar dining set\n... ethics have also been questioned the inspector general's office has been looking at among other things his redrawing of the boundaries of the grand staircase Escalante national monument in Utah the benefit of Trump ally\nThere are other investigations says crusader director of the western values project Montana based conservation watchdog group\nThere's another that involved a real estate deal that secretary Zinke heat Family Foundation with actually involved with in his home town that would've been finance in part by the church Halliburton which of course has a lot of it before the department of interior\nBut today in a statement to NPR Interior Department spokeswoman Heather swift said Carson's email had false information in it that no decision was ever made to move tops to interior that while she was referred to the department by the White House as a potential candidate for a job and the inspector general's office quote\nAt the end of the day she was not offered a job and interior Brian Naylor NPR News Washington\n\nIt's all things considered from NPR News\nHi my name is Becky charges and a kindergarten teacher at ... elementary that went from being a lot of

I Can't they re imagine the space and out of food court or something\nThey can do it on paper but they can't manage it financially because the malls volume has declined to the extent that there is no financial viability left\nWhen you talk about the triple a malls that are striving or those congregated in a certain part of the country is there a certain type store type layout that is working for them to pay me a little bit more of a picture of what those look like\nThey're dispersed throughout the United states and they straddle urban population center and heavily populated affluent suburban community\nSo they're typically the biggest shiny is penny in the marketplace it virtually every major population centers throughout the United states there is one and in some cases two of these AAA centers that are doing fine they're fully tended to they've got lots of footsteps\nThey're still sought out as destinations by customers\nIt sounds as though you're describing a landscape in which some malls are disappearing some malls are thriving but all of them are being re imagined in what ways where if you will an anchor store be as important as it was a generation ago people rethinking outdoor versus indoor spaces what trends are you seeing\nWill the egg restore was typically a department store in the department stores genre is for the most part on its way out but now several things have happened first of all the apparel an accessory trends have declined uh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on\nTech and on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of clothes\nAnd the whole idea that an over large box will act as the draw for a mall\nIs probably outmoded as well and many of the triple a malls or so to speak the anchor tenant as someone like the apple store my which doesn't occupy a traditional acres space but draws an enormous amount of traffic into the center [noise]\nDo you go shopping malls regularly\nNo fly when I was a gainfully employed in the business I did that two and three times a week everywhere in the United states and Canada\nBut frankly um they're they're less and less attractive they offer less and less appeal and I've gravitated like millions and millions of other folks to the Internet which is I'm much more convenient obviously and much more likely to be successful\nThat's mark ... at Columbia Business school he was former C.

so many mail in ballots the county has rejected most ballads because they're missing information on the oh sits on the back of the male an envelope\nCounty spokesman Joe Sorenson says that's because ... is different than the rest of the state because it's bilingual for the county's large Spanish speaking population\nAnd the only difference between that and to stay as far as what the ... we have Spanish language hours that's the only difference is you're going to find the the state of Georgia\nSore and said would not comment on the pending lawsuits or why so many mail in ballots had problems with the U.S hurricane Michael is projected to cost Georgia's agriculture industry billions of dollars Sam Whitehead reports\nSouth Georgia's timber industry took the hardest hit Michael destroyed some one million acres of timberland valued at about one billion dollars Georgia pecan growers suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses the exact figure won't be known until after harvest is complete\nPecan farmers also suffered hundreds of millions and losses and downed trees that will take years to replace it's the third year in a road that industry has been disrupted by hurricane\nThe government controlled media has stuck to this narrative that was offered by the crown prince in an interview he gave to Bloomberg News and bad is the journalist came to pick up his papers to get married and then he left\nYou see alternative explanations in social media that he's really in Qatar which is a country is seen as an enemy of the kingdom are maybe his fiance killed him um you see these conspiracy theories to explain the disappearance\nOf course Saudis can search the Web for coverage say in the U.S media but the dissonance is striking this unprecedented golden coverage of the news Saudi Arabia has been replaced by these dark stories of hit squads and brutal torture\n... it's interesting listening to you and I'm thinking of the parallels to what ... himself wrote in his final call him the Washington Post just published and he was writing about how in the Arab world they are so subjective false narratives and these conspiracy theories\nYeah he did talk about that it's really telling he described the effect of the state run narratives and he calls you know people victims of the majority of the population believe it but I think there's something bigger going on here there's this is about the way Saudis especially young Saudis see the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nWill stay with that for a second to the we've been talking about how the press is covering this is it possible to gauge how ordinary salad to use a are following this\nYou can see some reactions social media is where you see it shock disbelief fear you know when the crown prince he's known as NBS in the kingdom first came to power he built this cult of personality was young he was dynamic\nAnd young Saudis and that's a huge part of the population\nThey saw him as one of them they based would say we love him he got them and he said he was transferred the country and in some ways he did his rained in the religious police he's permitted women to drive into work he's reopen movie theaters all of that is a really big deal\nThe new Saudi Arabia got all this great coverage it was suddenly cool to be a Saturday\nBut now the country is getting this relentless narrative across the globe so you find Saudis they're angry about it they're afraid you hear you need our oil you need our money why are you attacking us there is no hard evidence they say there's\nNo official proof world so does that translate into the Saudi public uh buying official government narrative of what happened\nI think yes and no I've been covering Saudi Arabia for decades and people I've known for years are now afraid to talk to me um there's fear of getting caught as a dissident getting caught talking to a western journalist there appears to be fear of the unknown when the crown prince came to power he created this tornado of ultra nationalism\nHis face is everywhere in the kingdom so for some they have rallied behind him some of them are changing their Twitter pictures to his\nOh wow is there any room for descent or for free pressure alternative narrative inside Saudi Arabia because there used to be before the crown prince that is true but this crackdown from the crown\nPrince has been unprecedented and the methods include travel bans house arrest detention without charge even force divorce in in one case there is a bought army you can be attacked on social media you'd get swarmed on line\nThe other thing is the palace his criminalized dissent with a law that punishes spreading fake news and rumors with a five year jail term and a hefty fine even if that information is just stored on a computer\nAnd just briefly where those measures in place before the ... case\nThey were article six of the anti cyber law was introduced because of Yemen but it was pointed liberty published on October thirteenth apparently to quell any speculation over the disappearance of a prominent journalist\n... just five days ago NPR's Deborah Amos thanks very much thank you and to another story now\nTexas where near record floodwaters are pushing through the central part of the state the governor has declared a state of emergency in Eighteen counties in Austin officials say they may need to open more floodgates than they have ever open before which could protect the city\nCould also send more water downstream most ... of member station ... reports\nCentral Texas has been getting a lot of rain for weeks now this flood actually started days ago was storms in the hill country northwest of Austin that water fed creeks and rolled into the Leno river by the time it got to the small community of kings on taxes Tuesday it turned into a surge of water strong enough to take out the main bridge\nInto town hall died this tape from Austin K. I. T. V. for the pieces of the bridge here flipping\nBut they didn't get decided that the pieces of the branches flipping over the river rose fast\nIt flooded homes and ... joined the Colorado River and got bigger and marble falls Jonathan Hammond watch it rush by from the\nBanks this is just\nCrazy absolutely crazy uh we went and looked at the damn this morning I've never seen any water like that ever\nThreat a Higgins said she was rescued by her son who carried her and her dog to safety through waist\nHigh water I was in my little trailer the next thing I Know the water rushed up to it it was that the windows in my car and my trailer and just when\nThe reservoir above often called lake Travis has captured more floodwater and a week and then the city uses in four years it's running out of room if it gets much higher it could over top and flood hundreds of homes so the group that manages the reservoir say they may need to open more floodgates than ever before in the coming days\nPhil Wilson is general manager of the lower Colorado River authority\nPeople need to take every precaution protect their safety and their property\nThis flooding comes just weeks after the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration updated its data on Texas and warned that severe flooding is much more likely in this area than previously thought climate change has a part in that says victim Murphy with the national weather service\nDoes the atmosphere warms it can hold more water and when it gets wrong out it was more and more shuttering out there for a heavy rain can fall\nIf officials in Austin do open more floodgates they hope to limit flooding in the city to mostly streets and Parkland but communities downstream could see more severe impacts they say much depends on the weather over the next few days and rain is in the forecast for NPR News I'm ... in Austin\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News support for WABC comes from Kaiser Permanente were members come get flexible care whether in person by phone or on line members can visit with a doctor and get care on their schedule more at KP dot org Kaiser Permanente thrive\nHi I'm Susanna Capelouto and senior editor at W.
