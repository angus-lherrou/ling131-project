I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm David Greene Brazil has elected a new president John ... and narrow and he is from the far right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man that I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThe union for the restoration of national pride I think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo try to remind him and the people that people will reveal about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they see is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and how the fed the remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in Rio\nRainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't\nThat he had any racism I don't believe this I think he's a really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as his promise to fight corruption to fight crime is as you said that does have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people here David a sick of robberies and the sky high mood right\nYet the prospect of more guns ... police violence those are concerns a lot of people [noise] because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I Am not found out about that concerned when I visited a ... or senior last night which is rolling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... power to a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks You're welcome\nNow we are more of a social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers apparently got fired up with words he reportedly used gab which calls itself an alternative to Twitter and as popular among the far right Here's NPR's Jasmine Garsd\nHealth services education and an identification what the Mexican Government wants to assure is that movement and whatever migration takes place it's legal it's safe and it's ...\nThe impression from here was that the migrants did not in the fall of Mexicans Mexico's immigration laws there was an effort to stop them at the border with Guatemala and and the and the government more or less let the man is that right\nWe have a meeting trying to avoid at all costs violence in the border unfortunately some of the people in the care of and have been very violent against authority even though that they have offered the possibility of entering in compliance with immigration and refugee status or police there is simply to uphold our laws\nThere's for essence of the human rights commission on ... of Mexico and also several NGOs that can testify to the fact that the police has acted appropriately but nevertheless we want to make sure that our laws are enforced\nYou offered them refugee status I Believe you said and yeah the leader of this group seem from terrorists Without Borders that is involved in organizing this caravan seemed dubious of that offer and indicated their suspicion that the majority of people who are invited to apply for asylum but all of them only be rejected and deported is that actually what tends to happen with\nOf well out of ah the the number that we have a ... a thousand five hundred people\nAre out of those um we have one thousand eight hundred and Ninety five people that have requested a ... percent that a request for refugees that this one thousand four hundred and thirty five of them are being processed and about a four hundred and twenty two have actually been ... factory added to the states so right now it's\n... I think that a lot of them will in fact ended up requesting to stop those because it's a very generous offer on the part of a Mexican Garber\nI'm just going through those numbers first you said thirty five hundred you believe this caravan to be about thirty five hundred people\nYes it's more that some of the numbers that have been a a thrown out there that the official number for us it's the old around three thousand of them are in the states of ... the carbon was a little bit bigger\nBut I'm Around two thousand I mention of or fire no regional coastal five thousand have already a ... percent that their requests for refugee status\nOf this as important in front of us perspective ambassador because you're saying the caravan of smaller than reported and it's getting smaller over time as some of them except refugee status there aren't actually that many people heading for the U.S anymore\nWell as some of them are fairly inning tend to get to the U.S and we have ghost corporation where U.S authorities to handle this in the best possible way but I Do have to say that the official figures of the people that are still in the car to have such he's around three thousand five hundred a little bit less perhaps\nAnd around two thousand of the original group have already requested a refugee status in Mexico and this the situation continues to evolve and uh obviously being monitored by Mexican authorities and asks appropriate in coordination with U.S authorities again we want to assure\nWe have a humanitarian crisis in our hands but we want to assure that uh these these can vote that migration is scandal legally safe and ordered\nAmbassador thanks very much for the time really appreciate it on the contrary Steve thank you for this space around them all the terrorists as Mexico's

Semitism was the motivator for more than half of all reported anti religious hate crimes and twenty sixteen the most recent year data is available\nIt doesn't appear Bowers was known to law enforcement he did have a history of anti Semitic and anti immigrant social media posts online he accused the nonprofit founded by Jews that now help refugees of all stripes of bringing quote invaders

D. U. slash NPR\nYeah It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm David Greene Brazil has elected a new president ... and our own and he is from the far right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man that I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and the union for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate financial and Daschle so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read to help pass the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects still\nHad to remind him and and people that people will reveal about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which this is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's essential issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as homophobia\nHe's really on it he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhat he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high ...\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a than

very much what was voting day like\nA well it was a it was pretty chaotic um every polling place a I visited in the capital and\nDozens of polling places across the country a reported on a large problem with a disorganization unprepared polling officials last materials um a biometric equipment that didn't work\nVery very very long lines um many of the polls opened three four five hours late um did not open at all so it was um a well intentioned effort\nBut the but the but the practical results were were pretty chaotic\nUm use your clear that enough ballots were casting a legitimate way that this will feel like a legitimate result\nThat's a good question and I can't answer it yet\nBecause as you mentioned um you know a large number of voters and one province Kandahar where there were some serious killings in the past few days\nHas a has been delayed for one week and in a second province staff they were there had been makes it a tax as well that voting has also been delayed so you've got two provinces a where the voting hasn't even happened yet and you also have a dozens or possibly even hundreds\nOf polling stations both an accountable and elsewhere where people had to vote yesterday a second day of voting because the polls never opened\nA on on election day itself and election officials say they're not going to be any uh any results or of any of any significance for weeks and possibly even for a couple of months\nWell so we have no idea who won these elections in ... given the they're not even quite over but let me ask you about what the winners will face we should note people know from a distance that Afghanistan has had a very powerful president to the extent that it's had a central government at all and of course a lot of decisions\nIn some cases are in the hands or influenced by the United states influenced by allies or her for that matter influenced by the Taliban which controls portions of the country will this parliament once it's seated have much to say what were the Robie\nThat's also a good question I I I think and I and I hope\nI'm that the country and for change when I was reporting from the campaign interviewing candidates and interviewing voters oh I found an enormous amount of a surprisingly large amount of is going to say as them and hope that this election actually wouldn't bring change in parliament itself\nA young

tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's I guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey\n[noise] yeah and it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is here um because\nYesterday I was walking with the care of and then we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police that we went to check it out they had like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan and then a couple of minutes later they just took this blockade away all the police left\nAnd the caravan kept marching so they don't know if the Mexican government is really going to put police there to try to stop them or if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet so\nWe've been obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to states for a long time now that this group and correct me if I'm wrong seems particularly large um\nDoes that tell us anything [noise] so ... you're right we we have been saying for years people fleeing countries like Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala there's you know lots and lots of crime gang crime is very bad there you know poverty is also really bad um\nYou know talking to people about why during this caravan of why so many of them have come together they just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because\nThis migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids\nTravelling alone put you at risk of so many things of cartels and gangs attacking you which is very common here in Mexico so they saw this as the safest way to get out of their countries and they think the United states is is the safest them best place they can be\nOkay and of course president I'm not saying though that they're not going to be allowed into the country is a lot of uncertainty for the group you're falling that's reporter James Frederick speaking to us about this caravan of migrants moving northward you

more dependent on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia is on us is\nRidiculous I'm ... and how is important well it's important to remember that\nIf the Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts to Saudi Arabia\nOr frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past\nI'm at the end and I would also argue that we need to look at the broader scope of of the train line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia we are selling Saudi Arabia\nUm it's a much more arms today than we were ten years ago or ... and so what I'm suggesting is that we just return to a level of\nMilitary relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting skill in that bachelor degree\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee senator\nJim ... was well known among western journalists who have covered Saudi Arabia and the broader region among them NPR's Deborah Amos dad has been reporting from Saudi Arabia for decades her first trip there was back in Nineteen Ninety One\nAnd she joins us now thanks for being with us today thank you what went through your mind as you read this final column from ... in the Washington Post\nYou know in a way for me it felt like\nAn obit for a man who was passionate about free media\nYou know he spent so much of his life in newsrooms and I remember is disappointment a few years ago when a TV station he opened in Bahrain was closed in twenty four hours he put a prominent dissident in his first newscast ... and so the powers that be shut them down\nYou know what turns out to be our last conversation he wanted to build an Arabic version of public television for the region and he said he had the money to do it\nFor the first time in his career the Washington Post gave him this remarkable platform the post also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach\nBut it may have been a reason for his demise\nBecause as you note so he was working for the post and now that his columns had been translated you think that that angered the Saudi regime\nI think it's possible you know it's one thing to criticize in the west it's another thing to do it in Arabic I'm it's much\nMore powerful so as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing the finger on not just that the regime but in in particular at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia uh Mohammed bin some on can you explain his rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be you know he came\nOn the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who own money who was in trouble\nUm Mohammed bin someone's rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom at a conservative religious kingdom into the modern age but he's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many ah in the kingdom he has also arrested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them and like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd Saudi thing to\nJail people in a five star hotel he also jailed\nOf Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban\nUh many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with him so you know at the same time he was fed in the west he was building this\nUm you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump seeing him\nHe is you know there's this myth of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria or you know we saw with the son of Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers\nI'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as a man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ...\nPolitically liberalize the kingdom and that for certain he has not\nAnd I think that that is now dawning on the west as as this story unfolds what is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king saw him on decides that Mohammed bin Salman is too volatile and replacing them\nYou know I still think it's too early to ah see even answer that question a you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance now beginning to say the crown prince as toxic the king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too important to us national security to allow the death of one journalist to alter where Saudi Arabia is now I I think we have to wait and see how the investigation goes\nIs that tape released what happens in the White House to really see where the king will go on is\nAlright NPR's Deborah Amos uh she's been reporting on Saudi Arabia for years thank you so much that thank you how\nMany calls today was the words of ... in his last column for the Washington Post he criticizes Arab regimes for cracking down on the free press saying these actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nAnd you're listening to MORNING EDITION of Ninety point one W.

Fulton County has elections there's always\nPeople on pending so we were training before the pending thing became an issue in the news\nYou Associated Press recently reported there are some fifty

vote with a regular ballot\nGeorgia's agriculture industry was hit hard by hurricane Michael with an early estimate of nearly three billion dollars now being released his name shot it has more\nFlying over hard hit areas in southwest Georgia state agricultural commissioner Gary Black says the losses are unprecedented in a statement he said it will take remarkable ideas and action\nTo help farm families and rural communities recover\nWell this idea that the United states has more dependent on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia is on us is ridiculous\nI'm ... and how is important well it's important to remember that\nIf Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts to Saudi Arabia\nI'm frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past\nUm and and I would also argue that we need to look at a broader scope of the trend line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia we are selling Saudi Arabia\nI'm a much more arms today than we were ten years ago or ... and so what I'm suggesting that we just returned to a level of\nArms sales to military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat as Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee thinks she center thank you\nDemocracy oh gee was well known among western journalists who have covered Saudi Arabia and the broader region among them NPR's Deborah Amos dad has been reporting from Saudi Arabia for decades her first trip there was back in Nineteen Ninety One\nAnd she joins us now thanks for being with us ... thank you what went through your mind as you rent this final column from ... in the Washington Post you know in a way for me it felt like an ... for a man who was passionate about free media\nYou know he spent so much of his life in newsrooms and I remember his disappointment a few years ago when a TV station he opened in Bahrain was closed in twenty four hours he put a prominent dissident in his first newscast and so the powers that be shut them down\nYou know what turns out to be our last conversation he wanted to build an Arabic version of public television for the region and he said he had the money to do it\nFor the first time in his career the Washington Post gave him this remarkable platform the post also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach\nBut it may have been the reason for his demise\nBecause as you know so he was working for the post and now that his columns had been translated you think that that angered the Saudi regime\nI think it's possible you know it's one thing to criticize in the west it's another thing to do it in Arabic I'm it's much more powerful\nSo as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing the finger on not just that the regime but in in particular at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia or Mohammad bin some on can you explain\nHis rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be [noise]\nYou know he came on the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who own money who was in trouble\nUm Mohammed bin someone's rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom at a conservative religious kingdom into the modern age but he's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many ah in the kingdom he has also arrested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them and like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd Saudi thing to\nJail people in a five star hotel he also jailed\nOf Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban\nUh many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with them so you know at the same time he was fed in the west he was building this\nUm you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump seeing him\nHe is you know there's this myth of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria a you know we saw with the son of Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers\nI'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as a man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ... politically liberalize the kingdom\nAnd that for certain he has not\nAnd I think that that is now dawning on the west as as this story unfolds what is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king sell them on decides that Mohammed bin Salman is too volatile and replacing them\nYou know I still think it's too early to uh to even answer that question you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance now beginning to say the crown prince is toxic to king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too important to us national security to allow the death of one journalist to alter where Saudi Arabia is now I think we have to wait and see how the investigation goes\nIs that tape released what happens in the White House to really see where the king will go on us\nAll right NPR's Deborah Amos uh she's been reporting on Saudi Arabia for years thank you so much that\nThank you and we closed today with the words of ... ... in his last column for the Washington Post he criticizes Arab regimes for cracking down on the free press saying these actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence\nYou know as we were just listening to that I'm I'm Christine Dempsey diverse went with me and we both around in this the control room while the shows on but when you hear something like that it makes you stop and that's what NPR does

S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was

murder of a hustle G O D of this month and the whole here in Riyadh at the convention since I was absolutely packed\nA new report says but we have um Saudi officials and business leaders always seem to have ... the crown prince who's the de facto router of Saudi Arabia was going to say on the subject to them a while to get into it and eventually when he did he condemned as you would expect to the heinous crime\nHe said that there would be a old that those responsible would be brought to justice and I think very interestingly he said that there are those who are trying to drive a wedge between turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOver the issue of course because I saw it she was killed in the embassy in Istanbul and he stuck a very defiant ... saying that those who were trying to drive to sweats will not succeed not well I Am from prince not while my father is king\nI'm not well president of the gun is president of turkey and I think the context of ... they're all of those who feel to his position in Saudi Arabia is that they thought through is under threat I think this was the message sent to those people saying that now I'm here to stay\nWow well I mean it it sounds like it was a crowd that was receiving what he said well but we should say a lot of people who are expected to be there were not there I mean there were high profile speakers officials who pulled out of this conference because these allegations is is that absence being felt\nBeing felt in terms of some of the media partnerships and some of the high profile speakers and so to the high profile Pomona rights is that said the oh western business executives are\nJust not the ones at the top of the organizations who went on the original building\nI'm the opposite of keeping costs of low T profile here I think there's a sense of trepidation a sense of whether this is going to go to say also have spoken to some of them and they all sticking to the original vision they think that this is a puffing storm um uh although you know it was a mistake and\nThe uh the those ... says the company said must be brought to justice than not losing faith from the original vision he laid out two years ago\nIs this event really important to Saudi Arabia this investment conference\nHugely imports and it's a\nCentral part of ... vision that he wants to get foreign investment society you'll get foreign expertise and to Saudi who's got a five hundred billion dollar project to build a high tech sits in the ...\nThe needs foreign expertise on money to do that are on this was one of his prime reforms full drumming up

C. U. R. has the story\nRural America can sometimes feel like a country apart thirty two years ago Ronald Reagan summed it up with this clip\nI've always felt the [noise] nine most terrifying words in the English language are I'm from the government and I'm here to help\nRural Americans since come across some even scarier words like opioid epidemic so what's\nYour average very serious problems particularly around the economy and all we are drug abuse that really work people\nAnd Robert Blendon at Harvard's th Chan School of public health says that of Thirteen hundred rude old surveyed by NPR fifty eight percent said their towns need outside help\nI think that's a surprise for a lot of people that there is a willingness by most NATO to reach out outside I'll\nTake the little town of bill in central Missouri there's a big struggle going on in the small town right now\nGabby Stanfield feisty compact woman pushing Seventy looks up from the front porch of the town of Fifteen hundred corralled by green rolling hills and foreign fuel and split by opposing view of outside involvement\nPeople wanting it to grow and wanting it to be the best they can be [noise] and people that would prefer that everyone back off and let them do what they want\nIt's pressing here because this town is struggling with the same issues plugging much of rural America\nMoney you you don't have a tax base anymore that you used to have the shoe factory\nIn bill a big employer and many local shops closed decades ago\nCareer options are scares some petty crimes go unpunished and like in much of rural America drug abuse is widespread\nEven though we're rural the idea that we're safe isn't really there anymore\nRoxy Murphy covers bill for the Mary's county advocate newspaper\nThere's no way that the community will be able to fix that drug problem by themselves in order to do that they would need more money and more resources that they don't have\nBut it's not like bills getting up and that's another thing that popped out in NPR's rural poll Robert Blendon says ... half of those surveyed say their community problems can be sold within five years\nIt is not all a world of hopelessness as many others are described as a great deal of them is that we can deal with these issues if we can get outside help\nAnd blended says that if those looking for outside help three out of five expected to come from government especially state governor [noise]\nProblem is state money is getting harder to come this is\nA used to be the ... road\n... standing on a grassy right of way cutting straight through ten where she says the state's once promised to build a major\nCrisis they like the people that\nTravel to go through ... could see so many possibilities for this\nTown growing by having people from out of the city coming in here and spending their money here and now and now\nWell the first was found Monday outside of New York home of the billionaire investor George Soros who of course there's also a big contributor to democratic causes a the others were then discovered address to Hillary Clinton a former president ... bomber\nObama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan now the package that was intended for Britain was actually sent it to see in an office in New York and discovered in the mail room there yesterday\nAnd then late last night the FBI said that it had confirmed to more suspicious packages that were very similar in appearance of the other five\nAre these two were address to Maxine Waters she's a California Democrat in the house who has been a very short critic of a President Trump\nSo officials are already talking about these things as pipe bomb they're using that term what what exactly are those and and who would have wanted to send pipe bombs to to these people\nWell in terms of who would have wanted to send them we don't we don't know at this point uh there's no word on a possible suspect uh this is still very early in the investigation now as for the the the packages themselves um we\nKnow that they were sent in identical bubble raft manila envelopes uh they were the address is on them were all computer printed\nOn the return address on every single package was that a democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida\nAre each package had six U.S Postal service stamps the one that was actually address to a former attorney general holder didn't make it to his office it was a return to sender the FBI says so in that case to the address of Wasserman Schultz she of course did not send these packages\nShe has said that she's a very troubled by the way that her name has been using all of this\nAnd it actually her own office in Florida was evacuated yesterday or because of a suspicious package there\nTen let's turn this over to you for a minute I mean this is a pretty unusual moment in the country's recent history how was the president been reacting the president has\nBeen reacting in the way that you would expect the president to react he has a condemned or any acts\nOr threats of political violence saying that it's an attack on our democracy itself\nUm and in his rally speech last night\nUm he also said quote we want all sides to come together in peace and harmony he he's talking about wanting to turn down the temperature on some of the political rhetoric maybe not at attacking one political enemies in moral terms now the reality is that he\nHas done just that attacking his political enemies in moral terms but he didn't do it last night\nIt's interesting because the president's mood at these rallies is usually pretty upbeat pretty combative [noise] um but it sounds like he was in a different kind of mood yesterday yeah so\nRally was at an airport ... aircraft hangar in uh in Wisconsin um and there was a big crowd of people and it had all the trappings of a usually\nTrump rally accept it then the president simply red from the teleprompter and uh he he does that say well it was almost like he went to a rally and he delivered a speech that you'd see in the East Room at the White House um and he was um he was a self conscious about\nThat I sort of calling it out to his supporters they're saying hey look I mean here's a clip\nThe way you see how nice someday but it's just like how do you understand that [noise] we're all behaving very well [noise]\nAnd all the way we can keep it that way right\nHow long he keeps it that way is not clear ah off and he will become teleprompter Trump for a while and then he will switch back to rally Trump\nAnd and you just don't know when it's going to happen in the person doesn't say anything directly about the people who were targeted to have any of them said anything yeah that's right he didn't say any of the names of the people who've been targeted often they're features of his rallies as a Hillary Clinton was speaking yesterday at\nAn event and she said that she is fine

general is essentially saying as you kept two sets of books\nTom ... the director of finance for the Institute for energy economics and financial analysis and former New York state comptroller ... says the allegations are about Exxon refusing to write down the value of its fossil fuel assets that are still in the ground\nTwo sets of books one internally that they were um keeping so that they understood what reality was and another more nuanced reality if you will for the investment public\nThe allegation really is that the company is not as big as it says it is and it's not worth as much as it says it is\nExxon declined to comment to NPR but released a statement that said in part\nThese baseless allegations or a product of closed door lobbying by special interest political opportunism

fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nYou learning about I spent thirty percent top pertain to stock market sounds pretty darn bad what's going on\n[noise] well China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't\nA great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing years ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast China is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now\nSo if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was

heinous crime\nHe said that there would be a old that those responsible would be brought to justice and I think very interestingly he said that there are\nThose who are trying to drive a wedge between turkey and Saudi Arabia over the issue of course because her so she was killed in the embassy in Istanbul\nAnd he stuck a very defiant notes saying that those who are trying to drive to sweats will not succeed not well I Am crown prince not while my father is king\nI Know well president of the gun is president of turkey and I think the context of ... they're all of those who feel to his position in Saudi Arabia so they thought through is under threat I think this was a message sent to those people saying that now I'm here to stay\nWow well I mean it it sounds like it was a crowd that was receiving what he said well but we should say a lot of people who are expected to be there were not there I mean there were high profile speakers officials who pulled out of this conference because these allegations is is that absence being felt\nThe absence is being felt in terms of some of the media partnerships and some of the high profile speakers inside of the high profile pile of moderate says\nThat said that oh western business executives had just not the ones at the top of the organizations who have on the original building um I'll have to say that keeping quite so low key probably

Democrats and five independence a majority that includes a mix of all three would have to agree on the maps but\nThe opposition calls the proposal and expensive way to change the system that already

you're fighting to keep your children safe from criminals and somehow when you don't know if someone's going to pick up your resume because of your name\nRobin if I could ask you about the allegations who told you\nOr did you find out in the press and we all found out through the press and you know of course shocking surprise and then\nYou're polarized as a team with the moral and ethical thing to do and they made an executive decision and Marcy ... and all of them\nDeciding to close out this beautifully operatic show and what it also would have meant to shut down is that we would have been putting almost two thousand people out of a job in the state of Maryland where we shoot and\nThat was security that people were dependent on did you essentially have\nTo go back to square one I mean how much had you already started to think about the upcoming season or even I think\nI read you'd started shooting at right Melissa put you on the spot we had started shooting at it and we we thought it through um really by just about the whole thing\nBut all of the DNA was was there at you know season five ended with a robin's character Claire turning to the camera and saying my turn so that was indeed what we continue to serve and explore and I will say just because\nThe character Francis under orders not on the screen doesn't mean who's essence is not on the screen that doesn't mean that was not still being dealt with and in his options became a dramatic opportunity to see who would try to fill that space\nRight we knew to deny the existence of Francis Underwood would be dishonest you know to the history of the show um there's no way that Claritin and dialogue with her past with him as she's forging a future for herself and she may\nBe comfortable in this position but others around her or not and there's this scene early on when Greg Kinnear as character this D.C powerbroker\nHe has ... old Clare president Underwood into signing the bill and when she finally agrees he physically grabs her hand and covers it with his as she signs it and I found this so disturbing to watch\nMaybe because of everything else it's around the show but like this idea that he feels he could manipulate her what was that seemed like free Robin\nThere's a lot of discussion around that remember where I live in which she asked\nMen and the decision behind saying yes to let him do that ... was because in politics and what so much of the backbone of the show is about is you always have to sacrifice something to get what you want\nI mean we always knew that we wanted this season to be an exploration of who owns the White House so no matter what and this was a physical men as an association of a of a scene we were working on\nAnd you know so ... is this country [laughter] you know within the world of the show ready for a female president huh [noise]\nUm if I could ask you Robin just about your relationship with Kevin Spacey you've talked about it before as something that was a it was a professional relationship um you didn't really know him socially\nBut you told variety last month and I'm quoting here that you feel sorry for anybody who's life is in the public arena that you hate that part of the industry\nAnd you also said you believe in second chances do you still feel that way about Hollywood writ large in about about Kevin Spacey\nUm yes I hate what the media does with our sentiments in our words um [noise]\nAnd I didn't say just that sentence this is the problem with being extracted [noise]\nUm you know that's one sentence out of a paragraph that I said I said I Believe when people do the work and they reform I think everybody has the ability to do that\nDo the work and reform and that's what I said and in that instance then you should be given a second chance in life\nIf they're true change that occurs so I wasn't pinpointing any specific human being I was talking about humankind and their abilities so when I was paraphrased um I've just decided to not common anymore because I'm I'm so sick of\nAh being taken out of context and then then that's being insensitive to victims out there that I'm not insensitive to [noise] as\nYou all move away from this project what have you\nAnd from this show these characters [noise]\nNormally you're making a movie for six eight ten weeks and then you say goodbye of those people\nThis was a six year relationship that we had we we spent more time with each other than we did our own families and people would come on set and they walk off and they were like wow it's palpable\nHow close everyone is you can feel how everyone has each other's back they just want all of you to do the best work I mean we would crack up after a certain scenes lines that you guys could right and we're like we\nJust actually so [laughter] we're line came out of my mouth I Can't believe that it was fun\nThe last day of shooting I imagine was full of a lot of emotions\nIt was just jumping up and down and sobbing at the same time it's good to put characters to bed I'm sure it's the same for you guys as writers right\nYeah but that night nobody wanted to go to bed [laughter] we'll do not want to leave this that it wasn't until they break that people actually finally left 'cause well didn't want to go [noise]\nWell it has been a pleasure talking with the three of you and caring for you [noise]\nThat was our\nCo
