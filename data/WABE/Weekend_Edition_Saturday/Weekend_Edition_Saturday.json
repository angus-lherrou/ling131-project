described efforts by the Russian backed\nInternet research agency to use Twitter budge to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including issues raised in sports\nAndrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls you've had on the controversy over players shouldn't kneel during the plane of the national anthem was beaten joined us from New York Thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nWhy was this Internet research agency [noise] interested in whether football players took her near not during the plane or the anthem\nWell at first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic\nRegularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain [noise]\nWhat did you find when you were dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency\nWell what we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen President Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude\nWhich it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\nMm So it it it wasn't direct the TV in a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this tidbit\n[noise] uh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed direct\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the clubs and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in\nOn controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAt the march Eli home Victor show Jeff another violin she owned and said she played it just a few months before her death\nShe just

and thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me and what your immediate reaction to senator Manchin Cheney intends to vote for drugs capital\nIt's devastating but it's honestly not super surprising\nYeah well yeah it's been indicated also\nI mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia and twenty sixteen can the argument being made the senator mentioned is just reflecting the Democratic we'll express part of the people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that cabin on people mostly most people supported Kevin here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for reelection and thirty days and he he is under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you use a politician to being a politician or ... that's not much of a surprise visit I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did that to him yesterday on\nThursday we'll tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we get so we had a group of women who sat in his office by day and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday that didn't really go out\nOn Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on my two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of\nSexual assault and ask them how they plan to vote and he got away he he was very engaged in the conversation you had to step out of the room but the fact that get over that you you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah\nIt was extremely engaged she has got a question um I Do believe that John mentioned cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision\nDoes you're probably continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers\nAre fight does continue to sell a at first the Senate goes he he kind of knew that he had a he kind of habits because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has\nDone terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis and so you kind of your nose and believe an opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia He's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and he's just a bad guy and I think he knows that\nSam ... this is your opinion with me underscore that\nOf course this is my opinion yes of course um\nSo yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue her yeah so we're working on I'm working at a statewide to take things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe that just that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if if your Jones is if you have accepted senator mansions vote for what it is and I'm Still

Yankees had chances in sixth living bases loaded the bases loaded and the seven bang\nAnd if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic ...\nA Houston Astros but the crunch on Cleveland's seven to two court Gruber a great pitcher got clue or clubs you like the ...\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and eighty games the Yankees won a hundred games\nBut the actual still won a hundred but they would hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot about a lot a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and may seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut up against the Atlanta Braves\nAnd this is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs who I picked to go to the world series had the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the play offs by Tuesday night and you won't forget that but now I'm just saying that it's it's a crazy here\nAnd and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the brewers got shut out last night so all of a sudden you're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball\nAnd let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knock them out well the Dodgers have a nationally champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start\nWarm at the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you you have a problem with that I kinda like with the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the rocks already on the ropes merit to another and maybe you go to Colorado When things change but\nI I really like Milwaukee and the Dodgers I think this is just going to be great all of it's really good\nFinally we need to mention a twenty games suspension or in hockey Tom Wilson other cap shit Oscar sunkist or the blues on his Blind Side ... yeah NHL seems to be reacting to to head concussion\nMore no they're not reacting or they don't seem to be reacting they're reacting in there essentially sending the message that Tom Wilson to dirty player it's not just

ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kevin ... and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues well I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try\nTo get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nOh hi how are you a great thanks so how has changed since humans intervened in this process well\nListen since about ten thousand years ago and the origin of agriculture human beings have been messing around with the ... plant what you're looking at is\nNatural varieties which ... which are tasteless which have no smell and uh the farmers were like we can do better than this and they started cross breeding almost from the get go\nI didn't think this is going to go so immediately to the sex life of plants that apparently that's where we're headed um I mean why though has modern fruit become as sugary as it has\nWell one of the main dates remember here is Nineteen thirty which is one of the United states play a passes the plant patent act\nAnd from that point forward the idea is we're trying to\nEncourage farmers to actually manipulate those plants and to make them sweeter and to make them fat or a and also to make them see list to take their sex away in fact what's happening is is that when you when you actually take the sex drive of a plant away when you take away it feeds\nIt actually could puts more energy into getting fat and sweet\nWhen you read about how fruit um has impacted the zoo animals were you surprised\n[noise] uh no not not at all I mean as I say for years now we've been lobbying\nThese natural varieties of almost everything about them except their sweetness you you look at a watermelon there is no seed was watermelon dish the full of just bright red luscious fruit there's nothing like that found in nature the tomatoes you find in nature are tiny and it tastes lists\nThe apples you find in nature or almost all of them are better as people don't realize that everything that we're seeing in the in the supermarket they're like super stars there like supermodels and and it leaves athletes like LeBron James that's what we're looking at the supermarket\nTo let me ask you because eating the super model of the of the free world doesn't sound like necessarily a bad thing I'm you've written a book about this kind of stuff that the farmhouse food stopping food on is free part of the problem has it become less nutritious is it just good looking unless good for us\nI I think that the argument among the dieticians is is that is the yes the higher sugar content is robbing\nA food of a a lot of it's a nutritional value and I also think there's a tradition in America of somehow seeking perfection through our food that somehow if we equal white we will make ourselves mentally and spiritually\nBetter and so of course if we see row after row perfectly glistening absolutely gorgeous completely look like Apple's we think yeah I Want that\n... but ... is still good for humans\nOf course eat like your grandmother told you to

after that he took some questions and a reporter asked him\nWhat message she had for the women out there who were devastated feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were any women like that women\nI think that's sort of\nI feel we're in many ways\nA lot of women that are certainly a tremendous number\nThat's an echo of something that he said at a rally last week at in Mississippi a rally where he turned on Christine Blasey Ford and and really went after her and attacked her for her lapses in memory and Trump said on the plane yesterday that he believed that that turn that\nRally really helped push Brett Kavanaugh over the finish line\nAnd that's something that's being echoed and talking points it costs the Republican spectrum tickets to the

too\nBut researchers at Yale University and elsewhere found huge barriers to doing that\nThey contacted eighty three top rated hospitals and asked what it would take to get a copy of medical records\nOnly half of the request forms gave patients the option of requesting their entire medical record hospitals didn't necessarily offer digital reports as required in this study found record

about Harvey Weinstein that really kicked off the me too movement and the the big question that I have is is is what's the lasting impact of this last week\nThis day long gut wrenching testimony now and and Christine Blasey Ford said that she was reluctant to come forward because she was worried it wouldn't matter in the end\nAnd now Brett Kavanaugh still goes to the Supreme Court anyway so what does that do what does that do for for women all across the country who saw Argo through that who maybe had a similar experience in her life\nAnd and have a scene this is the combination of a year long national conversation about how we take our Jason seriously or not\nI don't think that it ends here at all I don't think that it can and I think some people who supported Kavanaugh account and have kind of ... colon seem to argue he'll get on the court and everyone will kind of come together and everything will be better and I just\nI don't think that we see any evidence of that I think that the divisions in this country seem to be real and seemed to be hardening not\nYou know I I don't see him getting confirmed in all of these people who have been so passionate who've been protesting who've been talking about uh the sexual assaults that they've been through I don't see that just fading away it seems like it would make people even more passionate\nIf we're talking about the energy that might come off of this event you can already feel it immediately after Joe Manchin a announced Hughes support for Brett Kavanaugh went outside in was confronted by a number of demonstrators who shouted him down as he tried to explain it [noise]\nAnd I\nAnd I\nWent out so Kelsey you and I cover Congress this is just been such a weird process I mean it started off thinking wow this is going to be this ethic clash over the key swing vote then it became over the summer it seems like kind of a dud in terms of political interest in a done deal\nAnd then we spent the last month watching this visceral personal fight play out on national television and radio I mean what do you think you're going to take away from all this\nI Am going to be really watching the way senators recover from this if they recover from this\nBecause it's very likely that they're going to leave town fairly shortly here to go finished campaigning for the midterms which is the only let's gosh just a little bit more than a month away and once they leave they're going to go back into an even more partisan environment where they're running for reelection or supporting other people running for reelection\nAnd then they have to come back here and keep the government open and have a fight about President Trump's demand for a wall on the border with Mexico\nAnd I'm just going to be watching to see if the Senate is just a different place now are they able to recover from fighting so bitterly and are they able to cut deals that are necessary to do the basics of governing or does this continued to be just a toxic political environment\nAnd and for me it it's all of that plus what's the effect on the Supreme Court several senators and they're closing speech has pointed out that there's more institutional trust them the Supreme Court than any other institution and all of that's fading fast as well so\nIf we're finally formally viewing the Supreme Court is just as partisan and tribal as everything else where does that leave us\nYeah that's a really good question and I think that the only way we're going to find an answer is just to wait\nThat was NPR's Kelsey Snell Ayesha Rascoe and Tim Mak thanks everybody\nThanks glad to be here thanks\nThis is the politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it's time now for race of the we [noise]\nWe\nGet these people of color\nWe will never know\nThe way the [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate ran off my ... with us as well as the ... and diminished go\nWalk us through what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where it's Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and a former representative you've been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and serve two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt's the race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson is facing an end Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats telling me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman carrying gas wise I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of had had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nMe the Betty honest with you at risk up in the beginning that his governor for re election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had her she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had to change in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane ...\nHe shows me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAn awesome but can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote isn't Florida\nYet still um you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now\nAnd the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and so some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within the community have said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this communities power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate I should point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station that was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up health care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country\nBill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically and the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians the other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being this hard line on immigration\nYou know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill nothing really just wants to have open borders\n... one of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country that is really the case here in Florida as well because this was not the only statewide race and and we've seen that but other races are having an impact on the Senate\nRace absolutely in fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls or he's lead in the last four polls for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said is the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy\nIs and what's killing at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line right and and since it's Florida I think we can be pretty confident ever probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most\nFifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country or a Dominican mountain are Oh thanks so much You're welcome an alcoholic thank you thank you this is the politics you from NPR we'll be right back [noise]\nAnd you're listening to the politics show on

... foundation expanding opportunities in America's cities through grant making and social investing more at ... dot org\nWere so out of balance here women activists feminine see women can demand all kinds of investigations into them men cannot require or demand investigations into women\nEven that we're talking a lot about the enthusiasm that we're seeing among men head of the midterms\nI I think we have to sort of put that in perspective which is that the enthusiasm we are seeing among women it's somewhat unprecedented I mean I have not sort of heard or seen this level of enthusiasm for women and women are telling me you know they have\nNever done anything beyond vote before and in an election and now they're knocking on doors they're canvassing they're protesting they're going to march it's I mean there's an extreme level of engagement among women and so even though we're talking about what's happening\nI'm On the other side of the spectrum\nI think that it's it's not happening in a vacuum right it's also happening in contract and maybe you could argue because up some of the enthusiasm we're seeing\nFrom within and when we're talking about women here we're talking about democratic women and I mean that's\nAn interesting point because there are a lot of Republican women frankly who are leading the charge on saying that they feel like their husbands or their sons are somehow being treated unfairly\nThis time and twenty sixteen we were talking about will you see this big shift of women voters to Hillary Clinton in response to President Trump's various scandals and statements and the answer was a pretty resounding no\nAnd it's true now too when we look at the polling that has not moved Republican woman at all ...\nThey may go midterms are based elections typically and until recently one base was really super energize now both ... seem to be really super energize I guess one question is is this going to be\nA super ... on steroids base election and and the other question is does this fate is this like a boom of enthusiasm that you know if Republicans are the victors in this fight then maybe they fade out\nYou know look to us from his point about the fact that women are fired up women have been fired up this entire time right I mean since President Trump was elected women have been fired up and their levels were already polling very high so what this issue was able to do is\nEven though democratic enthusiasm ... picked up slightly since the summer it had a lot more room to grow for Republicans and Republicans have really struggled to find a single issue that would fire up the base and\nThis one seems to have done so and they were kind of surprised by that it does look like that at least the bet that Republicans are making is that this will be a base election because when you look at the enthusiasm numbers for Latinos for young people for independence groups that right now are leaning toward Democrats and are key core constituency democratic groups for this election\nThose are much lower and if that's the case then we are headed for kind of a train crash of a of a culture war in at the ballot box in November of base election\nSo we're about a month to election day right\nIt's a very short amount of time but in the modern\nNews cycle that we live in a month is an eternity like five years with Kevin ... on his way to the Supreme Court do we think that that that may be Republican voters aren't so riled up because they got their guided gotten two Supreme Court justice said that's a reason why a lot of Republicans voted for Donald Trump to begin with\nAnd they kind of fade away again or do we think this has staying power\nMe if you're talking about psychology um the motion of anger and fear is much stronger than the emotion of happiness you are less likely to remember the things that you're happy about the things that you are bitter about\nThat said we just don't know whether this is you know the python eats the rabbit and it moves through quickly and it's\nThis big moment [laughter] of energy among Republicans and then it goes well or whether this is you know the python is now a bunch of bigger python and anger as ... as a motivating factor is much stronger in the moment than it is among them\nThat's political editor Domenico Montanaro White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Asma Khalid thanks everybody You're welcome You're welcome\n[noise]\nThis is politics shell from NPR I'm Scott\nDetrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed in to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran to be with you it's got\nSome of the things we're gonna talk about would have been big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start\nWith this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an\nAuthorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all of its functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum coverage is giving you a bigger seats in Congress has not giving you a bigger seat and neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nDo do that also to band so phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for the cigarettes you might not have thought they were allowed but they haven't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated this Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott has renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like fencing all there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses a just a couple of years ago and\nTo prevent the introduction offend would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority they're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligibility for treatment and they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that second base so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see a same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send them passengers and diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations or go to account for roughly half the couples that the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences you can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world but in fewer than ... percent of the United nations countries is that\nPossible so is there a plan for for people who live in a country without same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt right\nThat's NPR's Ron Elving catching us up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the politics show from NPR Nike Ron thank you

of life synagogue in that city six people injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it as a hate crime\nWill be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning highly live [noise]\nUh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well let me know is that a lead\nAnd people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services and we'll be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue\nOr the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] put this into context for us there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRight I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil on eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades yeah\nAnd we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning\nRight um I went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um\nAs far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nI'm and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding yeah what are they mention there will\nBe a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opens its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so uh that's just one small thing that community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nYeah incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\n[noise] well it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania\nWolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life um something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nI also want to thank window his ... his team they are a big part of the community that all law enforcement promises to protect and serve thank you very much alternative ...\n[noise]\nThe morning [noise] I Would just like to take a few minutes and thank the outpouring of support that we've received over the last twenty four hours\nYou're Jewish community center of the red cross Salvation Army the various grief counselors the children's Institute and the many other organizations and businesses that provide food and logistics for for the officers and for the victims\nAs Mr Jones mentioned the area around Wilkinson shady will remain closed so that the forensic investigation of the crime scene\nWindow switch Pittsburgh public area right now probably remain closed\nFor up to a week extra patrols had been assigned around various sensitive locations throughout the city of Pittsburgh to include where the scheduled event Walker tonight\nAnd the next few minutes a medical examiner or released the names of the deceased victims\nI Would personally asked that the media respect the privacy of the families of these victims I was there last night and witnessed the notifications being made to the families is a very difficult time for the families and I asked you to give them some distance\nFinally if you see a first responder whether it be a police officer paramedic or firefighter go up to them and say thank you\nFor their work that they've done the last twenty four hours has been extremely stressful for them and awarded thanks would go a long way at this time I turn it over the Pittsburgh your police chief Scott Schubert who will give you an update on his officers thank you [noise]\nHere listening to special coverage from more than the army's\nA first and foremost is 'cause everybody's saying or a heartfelt\nCondolences to the victims in to their families and their friends and we have a of a strong relationship with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh and I just want to tell them that we agree with you\nWe support you and we're here few we will continue to work with you\nUh this is a tragic [noise] a thing for everybody but it's something that makes Pittsburgh strong is that we work together so we are going to continue to do that uh I I still want to praise the officers for what they did a I mean they ran into danger they ran into gunfire to help others\nOr some of that training some of that experience\nBut it's their inner core that wants to them\nTo help others that wants to save lives and they did that yesterday so we want to praise them for that\nOr the four officers were injured one was released yesterday uh we're praying one will be released today\nAnd then the other to have a little bit more that that needs to be done and can't say enough for the the medical staff at the hospitals for what they're doing for the officers ... we have got ...\nAnd ah they're they're doing a fantastic job ah with that I Can't say enough for the interagency interagency support\nA western Pennsylvania is blessed to have so many a law enforcement agencies that work together that train together\nUh and yesterday just showed how that works city colleagues state federal agencies

Finkelstein I'm the president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh [noise] um so I have to begin by saying that I've seen this room a lot of times on TV and I never thought I'd be at the podium [noise] um\nThis is an awful awful period for a Jewish community and uh and especially for the families who have been affected and it's real when once you hear the names were going to do everything we can to help the families how we're in the process of doing that now\nAnd will be there for them and be there to help our Jewish community and the Pittsburgh region a heal from this\nI Want to echo a lot of the things and gratitude that people have already expressed to local law enforcement to the FBI\nUm to to ... an army the red cross evolve been there with us yesterday at the Jaycee see I Want to thank my colleagues at the Jewish community center and Jewish family and children's services especially\nFor really stepping in to work with a with the families um and um and you

Pittsburgh\nAnd we will be there in all communities to support our friends in the Jewish community\nWe um [noise] as I said it had been knocked down before but we've always been able to stand back up because we worked together and I have to take a moment to think those that spoke earlier\nThe effort that was put in across multi jurisdictions from the federal should the state to the county to the local\n[noise] to help us make sense since something so senseless hum we are now joined by NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson um and to put this into context as well because there were package bombs sent a prominent Democrat this past week and uh this is affecting our political discourse in our political leaders good morning Mara\nHigh ... President Trump held a political rally in Illinois in the wake of the shooting at the tree of life synagogue what did he have to say yeah let me just say if you thought first of all my mom grew up in the Jewish\nI mean he he uh Pittsburgh she's Ninety to my cousins all grew up in this world hill and what we're talking about I think is the worst anti Semitic attack in us history just days after as you just said the largest assassination attempt on political leaders in us history so too\nHorrific violent acts and the president has had a lot of unifying words he has spoken out against what he's called pure evil\nBut he has followed those words with partisan attacks politics as usual at his rallies with a little less vitriol he said last night at his rally in Illinois I'm going to tone it down a little bit and he did\nBut it's also true and we're going to have a big debate about this that he has tweeted that George Soros funded the caravan the short shoulder championships Berg also posted on\nSocial media that Jews were funding the caravan he particularly I was angry about the Hebrew immigrant aid society\nAnd the Kevin McCarthy the majority leader\nIn the house has been tweeting how Soros dire and Bloomberg are trying to steal this election which is\nPretty coated anti Semitic language so we're going to have a big debate about whether the president's words words of other\nPeople helped create this climate nobody's saying that in any way the president is responsible for what happened\nBut there is what he says and then there is what people here we're also going to have a big debate about gun control right after the incident the president said that if there had been more people with guns in the synagogue this wouldn't have happened already you've heard the Pittsburgh mayor and the governor of Pennsylvania say no that's not the answer [noise] so [noise]\nTen days nine days out from the election we've got the situation to process and try to figure out how to stop in the future\nAnd Mara let me just say first of all I'm so sorry I didn't realize that you had a personal connection to the synagogue is supposed to be the synagogue just at the community\nTo the community I mean you mentioned that there are of course many ramifications a mid term elections are just over a week away will the events of this past week affect the elections and if so how\nWell I don't know I think the easy answer those that quick answers to said that the trajectory of this election is pretty well set\nOf the house looks like it's trending to the Democrats the Senate looks like it's trending to the Republicans\nBut it might have some effect\nI mean this once again through us gun violence into the political debate some people might be reminded of how they felt after the Parkland shootings maybe that would have an effect\nI'm One of the effects that I think this will have as the pipe bomb story had is that it makes it harder for the president to control the narrative because we're not talking about cabinet and the caravan as much as we're talking about the pipe bomber and the synagogue shooter and he has actually complained about that he said that\nHe didn't have momentum and now this bomb thing happened and that's all the media is talking about you and listening to special coverage from NPR News\nSupport for W.

he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's ah the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no

getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrest\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media

A. B. E. in Atlanta hey Johnny hello so the medical let's start with you who the candidates\nAnd the Republican is Brian Kemp who the secretary of state and the Democrat is Stacey Abrams she's a former house minority leader in the Georgia general assembly and Abrams would be the state's first black and female governor and the race really a statistically tied\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression of who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is that\nKevin ... have sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as the selection comes closer more specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nAnd the registration that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nAnd this has drawn a federal lawsuit a camp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams ended the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that\nHer group is responsible for these messed up applications there are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ...\nStreet as complex to point out but the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular race has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning of the Georgia flag back in the nineties that the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbol\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate assembled to be removed as well\nDominican this is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president in two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race it's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell you know Georgia is one of those state that has been traditionally Republican but there have been signs that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for the final days of this race\nMy big question right now is how well is Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal but campaigns done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way that she just too extreme for George eight\nStacey Abrams equal to them being rating liberal extreme them campaigned with you know\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting out there Abrams I'm not sure has done the same with camp and so my big question is you know Abrams talked a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that ah Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand ... Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand ... he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill led Abrams has to climate she's going to win this race\nAnd we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W.

happen on election day just about a week\nFrom everything ... showing Gillum was one point lead well within the margin of error real clear politics however has it at a dead heat and the president's poll numbers are going out running neck and neck is this the race to watch on election night for\nThe new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats and he worked for already confirmed this this election is all about president Donald Trump\nAnd you know I like to look at it falls only one where when I got a like a mother was\nRunning me now to talk through this NPR's Dominican to narrow and Danielle Kurtzleben either hey All right so about a month ago we had to pull out and it got a lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans snoop all this time around looks like Democrats are going to be happier people reading it\nAnd do that we always have NPR's Ron Elving all around good to be with you Scott ... everything else that happened this week President Trump signed a sweeping legislation on Wednesday to address the opioid crisis uh what what was in that bill\nA rare moment of bipartisanship actually a piece of legislation aimed at helping people preventing overcome addictions in what has become\nThe worst health crisis in this country and many years and you know it's hard to think\nOf another domestic issue where President Obama pushed for legislation and provided funding and President Trump has followed up doing more of same or reminder on the figures last year more than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drug overdose opioids were responsible for about two thirds of those deaths\nThat's more than a hundred and Fifteen Americans a day who die from opioids so the house and Senate passed an opioid bill with near unanimous approval several weeks ago but it was not actually signed into law until this week signed at the White House\nTogether and we're going to end this gorge of drug addiction in America we're going to end it or we're going to at least make an extremely big dent in this terrible terrible\nProblem so what are some specific things that this law does one\nOf the factors cited in recent successes with controlling this scourge\nHas been access to Medicaid coverage which was expanded under the Affordable CARE Act states taking advantage of that have seen some progress in reaching difficult cases among the poor so one of the things this bill does is to lift certain restrictions on the use of Medicaid and Medicare coverage to deal with opioid addiction\nBack to the creation of comprehensive opioid recovery centers tries to address the over prescription of opioids and in many doctors appear to be getting the message on this uh the new law also backs government research into non addictive drugs that could be used as alternatives for pain management alternative therapies\nAdditional measures including new enforcements drinks for the United States Postal service so but they can try to curtail some of these foreign shipments of illegal drugs into the United states\nYou mentioned some of the overwhelming statistics of of how many people are dying from overdoses I feel like almost every person in the country knows someone in one way or another who struggled with opioids\nThis bill or it signed into law at a time where we're seeing some signs that this crisis may at least be leveling\nOff yes that came from Alex Azar the secretary of the department of health and Human Services\nA data for the first months of twenty Eighteen indicate that the number of opioid deaths is not increasing nearly as fast as in recent years he used the word plateau\nAnd that certainly hopeful term maybe a few percentage points increase this year rather than say ten percent as we saw in the previous year and twenty Seventeen the number of Americans dying from opioids rose to Seventy two thousand from sixty four thousand the previous year\nA new data from the Centers for Disease Control show the numbers are not rising\nAs fast in the last months of Seventeen and the first few months of twenty Eighteen\nSo if anything that the government has been doing can further that trend\nOf both parties seem to think that's worth doing\nAnd that's at least one hopeful story this week we're talking about how this was the the rare period where where both parties are on the same page but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together\nPeople saying look what we need here is to back up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just stitching together all these different programs are kind of pastiche of good intentions are that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say\nThere needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem as we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can if we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork programs let's at least do that\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving every week he catches us up on some of the stories that we might have missed thank you Ron thank you Scott\n[noise]\nThis

Republicans found one of their best talking points they used it again and again\nWe're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing it we're going to keep our promises\nThat does seem within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThe Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has failed harsher pale of Obamacare failed by a single vote early today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine fifty one\nNow is the Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care all election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it that has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this\nWith NPR's Scott Horsley Danielle Kurtzleben guys hey Hi so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the health care as their best\nIssue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with this how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned bare minimum but if you're a Democrat you're much more worry I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from both being on the trail and from polling data is that\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are worried about the health care system worried about access worried about costs but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire midterm cycle than Republicans have\nDetermined to fight for affordable festival health care\nTake it away like three hundred thousand North Dakota and he has a preexisting condition that used to mean no health insurance now the retina match with Morsi's losses to take away health here from people wouldn't bring the\nDemocrats are targeting\nIs the assault that Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily wheeling away at the Affordable CARE Act for the last going on two years\nAnd it's worth pausing for a moment in walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have had tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act or have tried to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ad\nCome down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with actions taken by the Trump Administration Scott what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy or plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people a book could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a health care marketplaces", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "28", "locations": [["America", 39.828306,
