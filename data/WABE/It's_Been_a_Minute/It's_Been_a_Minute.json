NPR News in Washington\nSo then so California puts these rules in place on the state level\nThe Trump de OJ sous but the bigger point for me is that this is yet\nAnother example of California showing a type of resistance to Trump that may not be the first thing that we think about when we say the word resistance like we say that word we think of people on the ground protesting but there was a resistance so the Trump White house coming from state houses\nChris what does this kind of legal resistance how effective is\nI mean a lot of it is from the ages it's from California a jeep Sarah it's from uh New York AG Barbara Underwood\nAlso there have been some some counties Santa Clara county in California San Francisco county\nYou basically have always had this I mean if you remember all of Texas law suits against stop on DACA under the Obama administration has this has been\nBuilt the way for the age of the other party of the president to sort of\nTry and say we're back to our dual sovereignty\nThey it it states trying to say we want to do our thing and we should be allowed to do so um is that more effective than protesters just on the ground saying stop Donald Trump I mean I think they're two totally different things I think that the\nReality of what Trump has done has led to a lot of lawsuits that probably regardless of the the\nEnvironment on the ground democratic ... would've fought back against but the the fact is that in a liberal state you cannot go wrong\nRight now a fire Donald Trump putting their name yeah by getting a lawsuit that is your name the\nTrump some more to come for sure you're listening to it's been a minute for NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was I'm Sam Sanders here we are too great guests today are we going to sell your business correspondent for NPR and Chris guiding her legal editor for bus feed news arena did you get three words\nDo my three words are up to Fifteen and I don't know where that out okay that's about Amazon money yeah dollars\nI'm so Amazon made huge waves this week uh announcing that the company will raise the minimum wage for its lowest paid workers uh up to Fifteen dollars so this is mainly a four warehouse workers and\nThis is because I don't know if you knew this but Amazon is now the second largest private employer in the United states really it was the first Wal Mart's so the number one Amazon's number two and\nHuh this changeable effect by Amazon's estimates a three hundred and fifty thousand workers this year and a lot about a third of them are are ... are expected seasonal hires 'em and did you know what the federal minimum wage is it's seven dollars and twenty five ... oh my God\nOkay um so this is much higher than that\nIt's like double it's remarkable to me means thinking how how long it's\nBeen since I had my first job and\nIt hasn't changed that much change and actually I remember it was five something when I was just starting out and then if you want to seven while I was still like an adolescent but it's been there for a long yeah so my question the arena is like\nIs it fair or unfair that I saw this news from Amazon and said\nOh well it's also a PR ploy you know they've had some critique of their business practices how they treat employees they've had some critique over the fact that Jeff Bezos is so rich while their employees are making some eleven dollars an hour is is the thing that Amazon had to do for some good PR as well\nI think the PR that convenience or element to this to give you an example Senator Bernie Sanders has spent many years battling for a higher wages for minimum wage workers and hats\nAnd finding Amazon like he's been coming out for a while\nNow introduced a bill that's called stop basis act out you know that no ... [laughter]\nYeah and on Tuesday when Amazon came out with this announcement I talked to Senator Sanders and his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon and Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's yes PR is definitely part of it\nAnd another really huge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into this season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they that they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in this this bump in um coverage of that I'm sure it can't hurt\nHelps them attract workers while I\nCan talk about Amazon all day as you know when\nYou look at it [laughter]\nI just signed for break or when we come back I'm going to talk with two high school students in Texas and their friends nominated them to be on the home of course a but they're both young women and if it off a bit of a firestorm and later my conversation with film director hike Baron holds\nHe turned his politically charged Thanksgiving dinners into a comedic thriller that we all can relate to listening to it's been a minute for NPR we'll be right back\n[noise]\nThis is not a boy one W.

in Washington support\nAnd you haven't lived this way or had the experience that we've had so it's kind of hard for you to come out and say that I interviewed a a\nSociologist who also does a lot of work with DNA at Columbia her name was Alondra Nelson and she said the problem with doing these DNA tests and then claiming oh I'm really German instead of Italian or I'm really whatever is that\nDNA is technical an identity is social there's actually a cat really mix the two that running a parallel track and\nShe got to live an entire life as a white woman mhm and get whatever you get out of that also it's like the one time we have a national conversation about native people they're centered on white people have bills\nWe're I mean in some ways it's like going forward how should we talk well and I always had a question because there was this weird thing in American culture of like I got you know my great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess or something I really awkward I mean people I think say it less and less but like\nYou know is it time to just sort of reckoning with all of that and like actually learn the history of which tribes inter married in which tribes didn't and what does that mean and what does it mean to the ... and even if we were led us and that is to say that in America probably only about five percent of us have really any native blood\nAt a I have\nThree words okay they are no not yet okay what does that mean I was talking about how it feels as if we are already in campaign twenty twenty\n... oh yeah oh no no [laughter]\nAnd I'm bringing this up because of two Democrats that have been getting national attention for months now are you mentioned was Warren from Massachusetts She is one of the other one is Beto O'Rourke he's running for Senate in ... who had Cruz actually interviewed him on this show months' ago huh but um\nThis coverage about to overwork and his race against Ted Cruz has been fully nationalized they had a debate this week and it got national coverage and I saw a journalist from New York and DC live tweeting this thing there are ... more than one pot task about vets over yet he's\nRunning for the Senate not for president and it seems as if he has become this great hope for liberals especially in this season the Trump\nBut even on his best days the polls have him down by like at least five points\nRight the coverage has has shifted um and then the conversation was about how much money he's raised and then there was a big question about is he going to share that with other ... Democrat yeah other national races where Democrats are neck and neck for Senate races\nIn ... in tight states is he going to help them when you and the answer was basically no money and it was like and then since the narrative kind of became but\nThat's okay if we can go and it's what he's going to run in twenty like literally ... twenty yeah right\nThere are already polls of democratic candidates coming out for twenty twenty it's insane and the other candidate that is making me think of twenty twenty already is Elizabeth Warren ... because you know she had this video out about her ancestry she talks about Donald Trump Donald Trump is in the video [noise]\nEveryone forgets she's running for reelection in the Senate this year against someone named Jeff deal\nI've been talking about like we hoo ha I go to I've been talking to folks yes week who don't actually know that she's running for Senate this year because they all think she's running against\nAll truncated write a letter I Want to twenty yeah yeah no I I don't want to live in this world just yet yeah I don't I'm not ready for it yet let it be don't talk to you about Iowa layout offered me a poll start raising not there at the state fair on a stick\nOn it I don't want to see him in ... well because you don't want it [laughter] the entire political\nSystem will go on whole day one before I let us know that's what I'm asking the areas that you know Yoda brave [laughter]\nWhen we come back we will talk about some serious case of fake poke study appearing in real academic journals and also later my chat with Rudy Valdez HBO documentary about his sister while she was in prison you're listening to its benefit from NPR we'll be right back\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to it's been a minute with Sam Sanders and only one W.

[noise] um I drove the length of the state and um I remember it being the parts die with two very beautiful Kelly yeah see I already grew up in the cornfields and the fiery so um no\n[laughter] so I bring this up because the state of Nebraska is that what the new ad campaign to boost tourism to Nebraska but their whole sticking point is that the state is boring and that's why you should come\nAfter this year right yeah you know to argue worn out by the chaos that you see it right I got it under the raft guide US law literally every now and\n[laughter] their slogan in one ad is lucky for you there's nothing to do here\nI think that's genius [laughter] I think they should tell people\nTake that take a drive through the ... you know like yeah they like the Internet turned off as

this campaign is all about\nNebraska is a place where on his perspectives and life simple pleasures help you realize what matters most\nYou know I never had any desire to go to Nebraska now I'm going\nI'll do it it would ask grey eye on somebody's front porch [laughter] I'm On a vet that person for hours [laughter] yeah that you know I'm I I don't care about the conversations that died\nAt All right in other wacky news I Want us to talk about a story in academia\nAnd strange fight happening in that world over the last year or so these really crazy studies have started to show up in some peer reviewed journals one was a study about rape culture at Portland dog parks among dogs\nAnother study argued that professional bodybuilding is bigoted because it doesn't include a category for quote fat body building and then another study replaced anti Semitic phrases in Hitler's mine comes\nWith feminist buzzwords yeah so all these studies are part of a big hoax fake studies placed in real journals to show that a certain type of scholarship is corrupting academic research\nThese ... call it grievance studies they associated with fields that are focused on identity like gender studies are clear studies are critical race theory\nI had to get to the bottom of this so I called up one of the three ... hello Jens Lindsey hello he's a mathematician\nMy backgrounds in what's called ... which sounds that sounds hard it's it's basically solving puzzles\nAnd I had a lot of questions for him but first had to understand what he means by the phrase grievance studies\nGrievance studies is this is a little bit of a complicated term because people think we're talking about particular fields or subjects and that's not correct grievance study is is something it up a method\nThat is an approach to studying certain things to be really really Chris was it the actual definition would be the definition for what is formerly known as critical constructive ism which is this idea that\nSociety is built out of power dynamics that are regulated in language\nAnd so the studies come from a position of not just say social marginalization or pressuring or surgery quality but rather one of actual grievance where they believe that the system is rigged against them and they're frustrated with that\nAll of us read heads in the u._k. are wildly excited\nBecause of the new royal baby yeah man I\nRead I don't know I didn't know she was pregnant you know she was pregnant by her red headed has been yeah there is some higher for that they will be a red headed yeah what they may be not prepared for is if they have a really brown skin read because ginger genes\nSo that quote comes from Jackie call is Harvey who was from the u._k. and it was ...\nRead it in and who has a book called

have a conversation now about a movie I cannot stop talking about it's an HBO documentary called the ... the sentence is about Cindy shake a mom who had three kids husband home\nAre pretty normal life but it all changed one morning when the feds came knocking the arrest them Cindy for something she was involved in years before an ex boyfriend had been a drug dealer and because she knew what he was doing and didn't report it she was committing a crime\nMandatory minimum sentencing laws for certain drug offenses meant that Cindy was sentenced to Fifteen Years in prison\nThis movie is about Cindy struggle to get out answer struggle to keep being a mother to her three young daughters while she was in prison and the whole movie is directed by Cindy whose brother Rudy vile death he actually began filming the day Cindy went to prison\nAnd found the life of my daughters um I was given a sentence of Fifteen Years in two thousand and eight and my daughters were for two and six weeks old and Rudy starts to film their lives and if it films what actually happens to families that are left behind on these um\nLong sentences in what happens what truly happens to families yeah\nAnd these long sentences like there's a name for this kind of sentence the mandatory minimums we should explain briefly what the idea of these minimum is and how some folks say it has hurt families like yours\nYeah I mean they're all you know products of this war on drugs that started in the late seventies early eighties\nWhere the sentences which would have been posed based on weights and based on different criteria when you're facing a drug sense especially in the federal level\nAnd I'm a lotta people refer to what happened to my sister as the girlfriend problem yeah which is basically you know she was knowledgeable about what was happening in you know the household she was living in but she didn't go to the police\nAnd you know subsequently she was sentences if she were the person actually buying and selling the drug yeah what exactly had your boyfriend your um your ex boyfriend been doing lay out the case for us\nWell um he had he was a drug dealer and he had started selling drugs in when after we started our relationship and he\nWas actually murdered and that is when the federal government came across everything that he was doing\nAnd they initially indicted me in two thousand and two and dismissed my case why to dismiss it they you know the feds picked up they dropped it state picked it up state dropped it and I got a letter from my attorney saying that my case had been dismissed\nUm it was really trying time at that time 'cause we're gee you know it was quite a whirlwind with the murder and then be in charge initially and then you know I Lived with my life and\nAbout my life back up put my pieces back together and then only to have them come back later and\nTake me away six years later and ... and so what did they actually convict you of I Know it was some kind of conspiracy charge you like what was the the the formal sentence\nI was actually given um for felonies or we'll charge 'em with possession within tend to distribute a cocaine crack marijuana and also conspiracy I was charged with all of his current\nWhen they came to you years after your ex boyfriend had died years after you moved on to start a new life with a new husband children of your own [noise]\nWhen they said we're going to lock you up did you think that any sentence would be fair or do you think this and then you to prison at all was wrong\nKnow I I've gotten asked this question quite a bit and it's hard for me to say because it's me out of you know I don't want to go to prison\nI understand that you know people make a choice and you know I I knew what he was doing so yes I I I think that some sentence would have been fair you know on some level but you have to also understand the prosecutor asked for eighty nine years for me oh my goodness I\nI was given the mandatory minimum the judgment as low as he could go his hands were tied that was the lowest yeah that was the lowest go he could go no lower because of mandatory minimum laws um\nI just feel you know hey maybe I'd never I never even had a speeding ticket you know so I kind of like two years three years maybe and maybe you know probation for ten years I have no problem you know checking in doing what I have to do and you know following the letter of the line\nOr not to interrupt but I think like the whole the whole thing with the sentence with her getting Fifteen Years is that it is such an arbitrary number you know what I mean I think that as sensing goes we should", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "21", "locations":

Sam Sanders\n[noise] this week we're talking about national coming out this past Thursday October eleventh we're looking at some big moment in coming out history ... coming out stories from listeners I've been talking to Marcy Gallo she's a professor at University of\nNevada Las Vegas just talking to me through the history of coming out and you can't really talk about that history without talking about this one big moment\nYeah it was a big deal uh she took a big big big risk and we'll her a lot\nThat's Marcy discussing Ellen in Nineteen Ninety seven on her ABC sitcoms\nYou kinda [noise]\n\nBut you're going to come\n[noise]\nI remember this year I was like Thirteen ... and I remember I don't think my parents told me not to watch but I knew that I shouldn't watch lab that make that ... and I and I probably thought later or not to to see it but I remember how they're given\nIt was for this woman to come out on her prime time TV show to her therapist who was at that time played by Oprah [laughter] oh God I remember that old I remember right\nRight exactly and it's not like I'm looking for perfection you know I just I just want somebody special somebody you know that I I click with and obviously you didn't\nClick with Richard has there ever been any one use cells Euclid was\nSimple it was his name scissors [noise]\nThey both have the younger much [laughter]\nI don't know I as I thought if I just ignored it and I'll just go away and I can just live a normal life\nAnd what is a normal life Ellen no normal\nI mean just the same thing everybody wants to my house and picket fence you know a donned the cat Sunday barbecues someone to love someone loves me when I can build a life with just I just want to be happy and you think you can't have these things with a woman\nWell society has a pretty big problem with it you know there are a lot of people out there I think people like me are sick\nSo I mean coming out it's been a thing at this point for a few decades and run the backlash that she face was pretty it can last a show all these conservative groups urged companies to not buy\nAds on the show ABC actually put an adult content warning on episodes of Alan that showed a woman kissing a woman [noise]\nThere was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine area and I'm so in April in Nineteen Ninety seven [noise]\nThe afternoon before that episode aired of Alan a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just got to hear\nSo you see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality all the good characters are upbeat you know free spirits wonderful people of course a lot of gay people are like that but not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids\nOr you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there is no right and wrong in this issue\nOf the only right thing to do is embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible bigger\nWow wow [noise] it's so funny he says there's an agenda here to normalize homosexuality it's like yeah yeah yeah there is a partner\nAnd I don't know how it happened but I put on Brokeback Mountain when it was like happening while and I was like I'm going to hear from her and I'll never forget she watched the whole movie\nHouse I might ... the movie and I look over she is co Ryan ... and I look at her and I was like what's the matter in this Pentecostal church organist like so saved looks men says and through tears like choking back\nWell I just don't get why those who can't be together ... uh so strange it was so strange anyway ... people contain multitudes even church absolutely\nHearing Patrick gel his story thinking about my own story it made me wonder why the idea of some grant coming out as always felt to me at least like a thing that's just for white people\nEspecially given what we heard from Dr Marcy Gallo earlier how the gay rights movement really grew out of the civil rights struggle of people of color and this post World war two activism also led by people of color\nGiven those roots why it's coming out felt so white\nTo speak to that question you have to go back to slavery\nWhen you think about black women being raped and made to bear their masters children or having their own children taken away from them or a black man being lynched or\nA limb being cut off for just a suspicion of looking at a white woman\nYou have the ingredients for some pretty messed up psychological and emotional trauma around once body where your sexuality\nIn particular is always under surveillance or doesn't even belong to you yeah\nWell and and and like that could lead to obviously black people feeling as if their sexuality and owning their sexuality isn't really there on\nExactly so if you think about coming out of slavery into post reconstruction there was a a movement among the black middle class in particular to counter the images of black people as savages as\nThere was an adoption of Victorian mores and values\nBut what that meant was adopting what is now known in in mostly academic circles as the politics of black respectability\nWhere a women for instance with you know wear gloves and long dresses and um there was a whole sense of propriety a gambling and drinking and those kinds of things were just about [noise] uh\nI mean is still like yes that that always gives me pause is like black people consume cleaning products writ large more than other demo yeah because you want to make sure that you look and smell and feel clean to the wife of all of that you know as\nIf you think about the historical context is about you know making sure you present yourself in a respectable way [noise]\nThat would eat Patrick Johnson he's chair of the African American studies department at Northwestern university [noise] more of our conversation after a brand new black men and being on quote the down [noise] was coming out story from a transgender listen [noise] I'm Sam Sanders you're listening to

S. dot ORG\nYou're listening to it's been a minute from NPR's Sam Sanders [noise] this past Thursday October eleventh was dirty national coming out day [noise] mark that day we are exploring coming out [noise] that was never just one day\nAnd how it's different for different people born in in this next segment you'll hear a gay slur I've been talking with e Patrick Johnson you the head of the African American studies department at Northwestern university and he told me how coming out can change when you're from a marginalized background\nI'm Talking about black people brown people and there's people whoever\nWhere you live a gay life\nBut you don't talk about it and maybe there isn't a coming out day where you tell everyone hopes no and and and like other folks don't [laughter] this feels to me to be a thing but it's much more of a thing for gay people who are not white Americans and\nYes yeah and yeah and if you are already hailed as and you fill in the blank in terms of ... a a a black person I'd like to next person an Asian person\nAnd that brings with it a whole set of responses to who you are as a person and so you in some ways don't have any choice but to\nLive with that because you you can hide it and I especially feel that way I'm for\nAfrican Americans in particular because of the connection to the church [laughter] you couldn't go to any black church in the United states and not find\nA gay man ... a whole ... of them\nYes um and it's a complicated place because I grew up in the church and the church is actually where I feel I came into my own\nOr work I mean like I felt safe there like as a young black boy in the church was the one place I knew I wasn't going to be made fun of correct but it was also the one place where I knew that I might hear the word faggot over the pulpit mhm there was this weird dichotomy but I always felt in this weird way safe there\nYeah I mean the church is where I was encouraged to um express myself which you know I was a big old clean love 'em and and the choir stand a singing soprano the only way over the Sopranos section\nI'm sure they ended up I'm sure they loved it they should be in that yet at the same time the pastor was talking about gay folks going to hell in God gave you age because you've sent yet ... not\nIn my church that I thought okay [laughter] but many charges were doing many a\nAbsolute and still do and still do and so yeah it it's a really a constant [laughter] right yeah no but that that's part of the other thing but also you know we also had the whole down low\nPhenomena and also we should stop to define with the downloads for those who might not know\nYes so men who are on the down low are men who sleep with men but who do not attend to fight as gay\nAnd they're usually black they only allowed to yell for men other than black men\nYes I'm even though that's not true [laughter]\nWell I mean like ... for like white men but they were living another life you know the lead a double life yeah\nWhy does it say about what coming out has become where you move from Harvey Milk in the seventies coming out day in the eighties to acceptance for folks like Alan by the nineties yet at the same time the subset of the community black man they're still being labeled with this term deal\nSo at the same time that yes there was a part of the community that we're not being open there was another part that was actually being very open in the seventies in particular there were a radical\nOf of black in Latin next lesbians were open and pushing things forward in ... and it was that we are pushing back against the second wave feminist movement was white straight middle class women\nAnd these black can lead to next lesbians like hello I'm we're here as well and so people like Audrey lowered a serene erotica Gloria and so do uh I could go on and on and all these black lesbians yeah and like lesbians\nSo it's a complicated history is not just that black folk sort of disavow coming out of being open about their sexuality or in total some make that decision but then there was a whole other set who made another choice", "show_name":
