people you know when it was the Roman method of execution\nSo you have to come up with somebody if you know that your film and you know obviously life of Brian of Jesus adjacent uh but if you know you're going to ... ... you can't end it with a wedding like most comedy can be A Midsummer Night's Dream or\nTendency to kind of bring brightness in genealogy too weird things like a kind of like

hardest part I realized I mean I what I did this I sent out to write the story and I didn't want to go to a publisher I Want us to just write a book so I wanted to writes how I wanted to write to us on just let's see what it what happens why does he go to what subjects do I find [noise]\nAnd then off to bed I realized that I had been avoiding dealing with some people I knew who recently passed and I ... particular Robin I hadn't face the fact that I really didn't believe he was dead it totally and I owed it to him to write about him because I known him since Nineteen eighty and we've been very close\nUm to write something about him and says thanks fresh wants to kind of an extraordinary person he was and so that was sort of hard to do\nBut that was that's the discipline of when you come back to a thing you try and put some shape into it\nWhat it needs what's missing ... can you put into the cake you know that make it make it better as a book\nWhen you did that when you're engaged with I mean Robin Williams is one of the people George Harrison is whether the folks that you write about um Graham Chapman although Chapman has you know you've covered in many more python centric things in the book [noise] um\nYeah how ... how do you feel differently about they're passing as they you know as a guy in his mid seventies like as a person who has a lot to retrospect about\nWhat you look around and suddenly all the people I found really funny and really great for going to dinner or I've gone Garry Shandling all Carrie Fisher I'm Mike Nichols you know they they you know and that's something that is oh I get it so what wait so the death thing that that doesn't apply then okay\nUm and you know I think the fact is that you just it'd be ... to ... put things into perspective and then you know I like to encourage young people um and\nJust you know to to write about people I Want you to write about I was like I'm\nLiving strategy bulk eminent Victorians these an ambulance Elizabethan but uh I I I like the idea of writing about ... says people who who you knew or have some insight into I think that's that's interesting for people and it's also interesting for me to write about\nIs the fiftieth anniversary of python coming up and you've done what you say will be your\nLast shows [laughter] um and you know you just wrote your memoir like you're in you're in

the same I think we did a big show in a big fat well\nWe have a little we may have some surprises up our sleeves but um it will be certainly not us particularly performing it will be encouraging other things to take place I think that's the best I can express it um [noise]\n[laughter] that's fair you're listening to ...\nI'm Jesse filling my guest is Jeff Hynes of the band blood orange why did you quit\n[noise] um this is extremely tiring I hated plane like the train and like six AM on a Sunday and it's like raining and it's gray and is this month everywhere\nAnd and it's so competitive and you know I mean I I Am pre ... competitive but not that much [laughter] you know like [laughter] like I didn't care that much and you really needed to care\nMore than I did you know like I play now and that's the level at which I care enough\nDid you have a vision for your life that was something else or were you just tired of running around in circles\nJust tired yeah that's really what it was [laughter] I didn't have any idea really what I was doing I mean if someone had asked me at that point in my life I Would probably say like writing in some regards like that\nSeemed to be what I thought maybe ... where things are going to go\nSo what changed because you've had like\nThree or four different music career at this point\nI guess it was this thing where music was always kind of in the roots of Maine but so much so that I didn't actually take that seriously 'cause you know through throughout all of those things I was making records in my bedroom and\nPlane in bands on the plane in orchestra and during like recites hills but it was always like\nThe the fun thing I was doing to kinda keep myself guard I was ... I wasn't ever chase him anything because what made me happy with just the act of doing it like I always say like I never I never sang in front of America in my bedroom I get more than\n... why did was like tape things off the radio and then like try and like recreate them\nI mean it seems to me like that might be part of why you're\nSuch an accomplished producer I mean like a lot of thinking a lot of musicians are also\nLike really passionate fans and ah I I hate the word right I'm going to use a curators\n[laughter] I'm a apologies [laughter] but like you know ... that's true of a lot a lot of musicians but like so much of your music is about ... it feels like it is about finding new ways to band aesthetics\nMm yeah\nMore than it is necessarily about like you know rocking a crowd or right you know whatever the other ... whatever the other values of pop music are many of which are totally great\nTotally I mean maybe this okay so maybe this will kind of experiment but more but like how I I'm like how I make blood orange albums especially the arts they give you an ex Freetown in this last one\nThe general trail of how them made I think kind of sums up because it tends to be this varies of course like it's not exactly like this but title\nSo like I ... the title and he goes on around the time for your dogs on was released I knew I wanted to their political and he goes on from there it was like thinking of a\nA more does that mean and imagery and I'm just trying to create like a almost like a template or like a mood board of like feelings and imagery\nLike an actual binder right like a physical yeah ... not\nMetaphorically yeah this is exactly ... book of inches and birds and from there once I'm kind of putting that together I have these ideas of uh\nThe music kind of attaches itself to the imagery from me so I have an idea of these different things are feeding as I tend to make actually these like playlists and mix tapes for myself of other people's music that\nIs feeding into it but then within that I've I find I see the things I'm missing or the things I Want to\nFeel an and meld together so that's kind of forming but it like the music doesn't exist you know in my head this kind of thing and then I'm Bryson words down so I started rising of woods and then I kind of like\nKind of work it out like I have an idea of why I think it's ... so I knew I wanted to open a record I knew the change I wanted to go for in the middle and I kind of knew how to end it and then I kind of like fit it in and I make that moved\nYou know [laughter] it's kind of a weird way and so old attracts tend to actually finish\nAt the same time in the mix and versus region when I'm ... makes in the record will just before that the tracks start to finish because it's hard for me to finish track to if I Know I haven't finished ... three\nSo it's really rare that like I could play a track to someone but I'll feel weird about it 'cause I Know that it needs to\nIt but it's all going to affect everything else so they they tend to hit the finish line at the same time\nWe'll wrap up my conversation with Deb Heinz after a break silicon what's it like when did he had your phone number and returned your calls defined has the answer ... from ... dot org and NPR\nListening to members took part in Ninety One tell you a B.

[laughter] I care about the very much but they I see them once a year [laughter] right and uh either it occurred\nTo not be responsible to in for this job in this group of people and um the people I worked for and with\nAn over time it became a very sentimental thing to recall and I was in the Celtic as I walked the streets and remembered what we shot on that corner and and that corner in that street in that alley but I never felt\nI regretful um it it was as full and rich inexperience as I could it could ever have hoped for and I never felt\nBurden I never felt resentful of the association or that it was limiting the in some way or that it I wanted some of that time back I just felt like I had been ...\nSomething where I got to play a character who was complicated and flawed and night and I loved figuring her her out and I got to live this alternate in similar I got it on an alternate universe spending more time sometimes being somebody else and be myself and\nUm it was so full and\nSo even now when I talk about it it's it's hard to imagine Ninety One hundred hour weeks but I I wouldn't have changed any of it [laughter]\nI like your actual day to day life was essentially a

[laughter]\nI ... I since I had a whole\nConversation we are churn Oregon on the show relented a couple of months ago a tree and I had an extensive conversation about backstage I Am ready to make out with him\n[laughter] like ah I think he looks so heads of wood that moustache me too I think it's so great and it's so and it is also a little bit is both incredibly like dashing and handsome and a little ridiculous [noise]\nWilliam and Mary perfect way if it is that really helps define that character who has those qualities\nAt ... totally absolutely and I will say one other thing which fits into this idea of when we were in ... for the show and in fact earlier than that I started thinking about\nWhat I Hope this show would look like cinematic ally and and what I wanted the music to look like and the costumes and\nSeventies cinema played\nWas the central ... inspiration from me I mean that's what I kept circling around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around and um you know all the great movies in the seventies and how they were shot and music from the seventies I wanted that to not only play a really important role um but I imagine that that\nMusic was the music as separate young people they fell in love\nTo you know a first kiss um you know skipping school all these things that were um narrated by seventies music and um you know Albert will skiing all the great costume designers and and so this moustache\nWas ... it did so beautifully into those ideas and just glimpses of things that show is not a period piece um but it is we help tell it with music from the seventies and even there are composer I really wanted him to find ways of I'm using the flute\nUm because I felt like it had been ignored for too long and [laughter]\nI Love the sound and it's so evocative and anybody of a certain age group or who was interested in music would have a reaction not just to that obviously to the source music but to the compose music as well so the moustache\nWas this gift because it was\nIt so beautifully fit into these ideas\nWell they're just good worker a I'm I'm Out of time with you but I'm so grateful that or you came in to talk to us uh I really appreciate you taking the time\nI'm like how a couple of things about this one if I guess I'm wheel and let's say out of here and you never get to see it and two if your guest right away we have ...\nAt all and I love that is already feel\nLike a late night you see any short circuits out\nHere [noise]\nThis is the theory I wanted to give you is it to some extent the format of your show feels like an institutionalization of your mania\nWhich is to say that you found a way to have a ... absurd commitment to terrible ideas that comes from mania that is from what I've been told them what's been described me totally amazing yeah without necessarily specifically having to be at a map [laughter]\nYes my certainly it's funny 'cause you know I certainly as an artist\nI don't think you making art has sorted out my issues in any way Caribbean a meditation have done that but I Do think that our became a healthy way to direct some stuff that wasn't always healthy I think there's certainly a type of endorphin or adrenaline and then I clearly need in my head\nAnd uh it's better for it to happen over the airwaves in a in a way that's intentional\nThan to let it just said in day to day so yeah I think I think your your your observations are correct for sure it is bad ideas like when we started together to use the baby for public actually that I started every show by saying\nI Want this to go well I put a lot of thought into it I really genuinely hope it goes well but if it doesn't my promise to you is that the disastrous\nOr other potential outcome will be as entertaining as if it went well like if we crash and burn you're going to love watching that probably more than you will if there's even goes well that's always been an attitude that I stand by\n... more with Chris gathered after a quick break he'll tell me about how after years of his star being on the rise she still has time to get in fights with his fans on the Internet it's bull's eye for maximum fund dot org and NPR\n[noise] you're listening to members deported Ninety One W.

I'm definitely a workaholic it's a problem it's probably like one of the biggest things are still wrap my head around is that I get caught too caught up in career stuff you know a lot of that is that there's the anxiety that it could all go away tomorrow which could getting better about that you know have a little bit for stability\nAnd they've ever had before\nThat's a nice feeling but it still is this thing I have to remind myself of ... I always had this feeling of like a you know like if if I can get one of those big jobs everybody have to notice it and\nIt's I have to admit that I was right going for this and so I have to admit that I have what it takes\nWhich pre suppose that they were all these people doubting me which was not really true like I had this chip on my shoulder about proving everybody wrong and then I Would accomplish certain things and I wouldn't feel that validation I had to kind of ... cop to the fact is like\nThat it's there is no them that I can prove wrong and then there'll be this victory like something's going on inside actually wants witnessed that ask at New York backstage at UCD and there was a friend of mine who was a cast member and after now talking to a friend of mine who was a correspondent on the Daily Show\nAnd they were stressing so hard man I don't know what's going on and we're going to get with my next gig ... might have to move across the country and there are so stressed and I was like man I always figured if I got one of those jobs I'd be happy\nYou're in the Daily Show you're on SNL you've reached the mountaintop now you can kick back 'cause you've proven everything you need to prove and I was like oh they're still so stressed out\nI have no hope\nSo I better just learned to enjoy the things I Do because getting stuff is not going to fix any my problems as far as I could I you know could I settled in and really enjoy it if I was doing something that was maybe a little more square some of the er standard you could say\nSome of the stuff I've done I don't know like\nI mean you could be for you could be the next thirty rock throwing rocks the funniest Joe generate shows more funding they said that Joe than there isn't but if I'm not about it's not about much more than being in front of it is about some others yeah I'm not trying to diminish thirty ride one of my favorite shows of all time course\nIt doesn't have that fire and it's got trying to prove something [laughter] you know have their mission statement of trying to like break the system sneak in the back to\nI feel like I probably could I imagine you know but I I think hard about it because there's a there's a part of me that's also like if something like that would have happened like I don't think anybody's going to doubt that I tried at this point you know he's not outing ... my indie credibility at this point like\nAnyone who knows my work would say that guy spent years\nBending over backwards to try to do this thing and at times he was the only one who knew why he kept going at times I had visibly quit and other people's fans rather be working on the show would convince me to keep going so there's a part of me that's like at a certain point\nI've done my part and maybe I could move on and just do something I uh ... sure I'd find some side project very quickly to um push the buttons that\nFuel a lot of my my ... one of the things that makes me want to keep up the competing stuff is you know you see people in this industry who eventually get to a point where they can produce other people's work and I'm not quite there yet\nBut I Would love to be because I I feel like one of the things I have going right now is I remember what it was like for me seven eight nine ten years ago when nobody\nWas particularly interested in had to just kicked out some doors and make it happen for myself I'd love to find the comedians who are in that spot and help them do not have to spend half a decade on public access TV to make it happen\nSo that's another thing is like maybe if I was to get one of those bigger jobs\nThat could give me that credibility and that could bring some other stuff into the world's but who knows I don't know I'll sell out some day everybody to us right [noise]\nIt's ...
