know it's it is actually won the opera companies do Houston grand opera did it not long ago the met is doing it right now you know so it it is something that offer companies do put on because there is

I Want to let you or your food I one thing I wanted to have to have you come to come to like this before Oh yes sir quite a few\nOf in Missouri last week we go all around we tried to what many mothers and we can because it's important that exactly like that what it is it really just like us more Yes sir it's like because that mother who had lost their baby\nNeeds to be able to see somebody else looks like them in the same situation that they are as someone walking up to them and saying I Know how you feel but you really don't [noise]\nWhich made me think about something then and I had talked about a lot which is in getting to meet these women and talked to these women\nEat the sense that their their experiences is really unique\nSort of law it's up to lose somebody a cancer of lost a friend that cancer recently Amtrak\nIs a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his for his wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd this is something you do see embed numbers even though the numbers themselves\nThey they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged ... so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah it's like past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it in a way because it's every day is another insults greater rate\nThan if I'm having to get in the script brown somebody\nSomething happened in you know here in Florida\nWe said in the lives of the club that\nThe family more than just\nRight\nSo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the Mondale got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nJust like you guys just have to every every event or no no I just wanted to know the ones on there and has been telling everyone about them\nAs being a joke to her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nYou know we didn't know anything about this but big in this must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping remind me right now we're all just simply trying to find our way because\nIt personal gathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age as there and going because it was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage\nHand okay yeah 'cause I didn't want to do like your house like a like a like some\nOf that I open my windows and I just knew will go through my house she said page comes down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House\n[noise]\nMid sized one story house into wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together in\nThe summer when a fire [noise]\n\nAnd now we're redoing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over eight of how\nWe sleep in each other head on the couch you know a mattress if it becomes like a huge sleep over in reverse look worn asleep for up to talk eight you know getting to know each other you know ... or the vice children with like therapy for\n... let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe we're at ... ... to\nMinutes when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people him in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nSo we usually the video that is really\nMom's house probably over like right now and then the police started came behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we called extradition and the vegetables are close to the guardian was here in\nAnd all that\nBut I I Am then 'cause um when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and papers that we came back here is all you can smell what's going on and so now like when you have any like it's it's not it's not as bad now but just the association Michael went unpaid onions you get that smell like it just you get those flat ... in\nYour time to any brings you right back yeah mhm [noise]\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute [noise]\nThose either ... some of the other one that started to cry\nAnd then you don't want me to a Texan yeah my find to be a lot of what about let me a couple of women enemy their phones man\n\nThen it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight days\nAt three two one\nThree two one\nWe all started walking back to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing\nAnd you know [noise]\nI mean we have we have an eye on\nIt was up to the fight we wrote a muscle beach and I and I threw o'clock in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember at the end I used to tell ya how do you live so far away from him\nAnd I'll give you an anecdotal rubbery quickly when I first joined the Philadelphia police department we were shooting people at a crazy rate on an accidental discharge the officer had their finger on the trigger when they would go to grab that person if that person pulled or moved ... jerk back and it was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger\nSo they sent us all back up to the police academy and we all had a ... trained on how to keep your finger on the side plate the weapon\nNot on the trigger so that that happened you wouldn't accidentally tripping fire and shoot somebody\nAnd you would have thought it was Armageddon oh my God they're gonna get killed on reality what he did was it slow down your field division it's slow everything down that split second didn't make a difference that blink of an I didn't make a difference it made a difference in your not shooting because that split second let you see what you thought may have been\nThe color of my glass coming out my cell phone was a cell phone\nSo you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that she would come back to again and again is this idea of time in certain situations slow down\nWhen you're dealing with the mentally ill person slow down like whatever you can do you've covered just creates in space to buy yourself another thirty seconds that extra thirty seconds maybe the difference between you're saving your life in somebody else's life another interesting thing was in Ben Ben found this out also through some of the reporting with other police chief\nIs the idea that some ... cheese don't like to hire kids out of high school like Nineteen twenty year olds in part because there was there was this the text allowed\nThat's only know how to communicate is like this and then when it when they look up and go to talk to somebody and ... and I'm Serious about whether the drive through McDonalds and they get pissed off the person order and cheaper how how did you do it it's just their demeanor just the way they act\nAnd in fact been told me that he touch it and police chief who told him the young people who are coming into the Academy of past years\nHave never been in a physical fight which the problem because when they get into a fight their hearts stretch the race in their muscles tense up and they don't really know what to do so they freak out and they're way more likely to draw a weapon and use the weapons uh you know\nTo to end the confrontation huh so how do you ... you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been beaten up on your nose and you know so that then says that that's why the police chief told him he looks to hire bouncers icy bounces or for ... what he said from just\nMy little myopic world that I live in we have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military they were my best officers they are level headed there well trained they know how to follow the\nPolicy basically you know how to not freak out during the confrontation and lasting promises lasting one of the most important things to it says\nIs you have to get into the community and I'm not talking about the the good stuff but we they bought Christmas gifts or they cook Thanksgiving dinner I'm Talking day to day\nYou have to get to know people yeah for sure and so to make this point to where it got up walked me down the hall to another office had sent me down on the computer is the sound comes a point\nShow me the video to video starts\nIn silence and its body cam video it's a body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car he's got his body cameras mounted to his eye on his glasses to the cameras going where his eyes go next to him as your side is his partner both cuts are white also it's night so [noise]\nCause for a guy who's running around with a knife trying to stop people whose office maids if he was on a crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly park flow neighborhoods street and you can see down the street and walk away from\nThis shirtless black guy engine show out there\nThat's the kind of talking on the cop were in the body can end this black man goes on race pretty negative than any walking towards the cops once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer and closer and finally the cop when the body chemicals out the taste of the other officers out it was as afraid as behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nDown is approaching approaching approaching a protein\nHe gets within like ... to the cops and then\n\nThe guy with a buddy him fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he hustles over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over and then he\nChanged central four cups and then they\nMay not have it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the ...\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot above you get shot and I say if you want to die if you want a guy you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police bullets can't kill\nA fan of our counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man\nAnd the UN's ...\nSaid this is the thing that you guys we use this video for what ... is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers when the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the point to eat at home or the officers used time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the current judge that when I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first worn and let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\n\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was and faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\nTo\nActually after we finished watching the video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood that I mentioned on the front step waves of ... what are you doing man that dared does stupid son of a bitch you don't have close came to be in that ... wouldn't be backwards mitigation ... wasn't doing drugs they was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nYou know again uh almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the winners they told him he just ... his militia ...\nShe would was elected sheriff ... county\n[noise]\nReally which is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a job with belongs his organization called her which is the grease executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition and police chiefs and twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being some being law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after per put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women who uh I've become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively\nIt does I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and I sort of felt the same way too but\n[noise] there was this experience than I had read just realized how far [noise]\nHope has to go [noise]\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to [noise]\nThis is Ryan ... calling from stover Mont

I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post ...\nHe's been reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men and a woman go camping in the outer on ducks pulled off the road a aside rode out through thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to campers hurt somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nWho looked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and very calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen uh of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods took them into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had to each of them by\nThemselves you know as he pointed the gun Adam and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied\nHe went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with\nGet really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad will happen to him\nWhat was happening in the name is ... with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times in the chest\nAnd when this happened three of them and their pants were able to break loose and start running Nick Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nDemand caught one of them\nDavid Freeman she took the boy back to the campsite and he had um lay down in a ditch next to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter then our men come\nMen that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted than the killer and Freeman laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun is going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly Cooley walked into the forest and us began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nOur there was a scene like a never

I'm Robert Krulwich this is radio lab and just before the break we were about to hear Robert Guerra the man accused of murdering a teenager [noise] Joe his attorney what really happened\nYeah and we're going to jump right back into that but uh if you're just doing it now you should be warned that they are at what comes next is uh probably not suitable for the ears of young kids are sensitive listeners so be warned ... we go back to reporter benefit [noise]\nAt this point it was just ... in the room and he told him yes he had killed them ... and he also killed other people\nToo and the episodes when Darrow killed people seemed to have\nFollowed a like a pattern you would get these intense headaches and you know become psychotic and\nDo horrible things when it came to the details you tend to\nNot remember but then\nGary mentioned two particular girls who were then missing\nAnd whose parents had no idea where they were\nTwenty one year old student pilots and another girl sixteen year old only ... [noise]\nIsn't that was from Chicago She's a girl I mentioned earlier cops are already looking for her hoping that Carol might have some information\nEarlier that summer her boyfriend had been found murdered the two of them had been camping and Susan had been gone ever since a leash a hawk she was a high school girl from Syracuse she had gone missing just a couple of days before Susan everybody thought she might have just run away but\nGarrett told the lawyers that he had killed them and where he had left their bodies one odd thing about arrows description of the incidents she doesn't say I killed her she says she got stabbed with mine nights she\nStayed with minor like it wasn't even doing the stabbing right like this is what do you do first and foremost you have to ask yourself is this true\nYou know your client is obviously severely mentally ill this could be a dreamy had it could be a delusion\nIf you're going to go and um you know craft an argument and presented strategy you need to know uh what actually happened W walks out the door he grabs Frank and he says he says let's go\nSo they they slip outside they get in the car and\nWe take off to go look for the bodies Guerra told the lawyers that Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up\nMine shaft the mind up bin ... about an hour south of the hospital ...\nFederal runners and in that moment were you scared were you excited like oh you rub pie it's a high but you're scared you're concerned yeah fear ... food for you do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm\nLady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talked to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise]\nTook of driving the lady friends car to try to lose I Need to\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here which\nBe as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren ... and the town supervisor of Mariah Tom's cause a father says it them a road that goes to the miners are what is your after the march [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just a very icy that day this hair is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly seats are no leaves and all the trees were\nI'm Sorry skeletal walking right in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they could've came\nIn here so right so here we are in our Sunday suits and there we go trudging to force looking for the\n[noise]\nBut lovable worse look [noise]\nWe found this was her well\nYou see the air shaft fair they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for that says get any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak shoe and blue sneaker [noise]\n\nAnd and a leg I said to myself the son of a bitch does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your money back up ...\n\nEventually algae found the other body at least your house body she was in a cemetery workout headset he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids\nWere the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can't\nYou just care we took her to know to keep your confidences over wire under the current rules\nWhich have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client is under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there is no if if if people are already dead then you ... the the lawyers ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for their clients\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client only only\nThe agent of him or also a citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what

happens next and nobody's quite sure if it was a slip up or maybe it was on purpose but when Garrett was talking about Susan pets ... says is that the one I found\n\nIs that the one I found so the cat was out of the back then\nThe next day Belgian our money while the press conference to try to explain why they hadn't told anyone\nSurvive without Robert does the ... because they had the duty to protect our clients secret for reading or abroad with ear but\nEveryone is disgusted those columns written editorials written letters to the auditor\nOr just no way in the world you're going from your average non lawyer if everybody turned against them but this has anything short of shabby some version of the law of justice\nPretty soon one of the prosecutors laid off that our money and Dell jihad actually tried to use these dead girls as leverage for Guerra\nThe headlines in the Syracuse papers would say body's used as pawns in a game of law too\nBusy with our money was getting death threats in the mail and I'd just as crews you phone call people calling saying stuff like how can you live with yourself I'm going to kill you only get to at one point he finds a dead fish in his car\nHis wife ... Molotov cocktail in the back yard he started to carry a purse through my bag he kept shock on in the car he kept on in the house so\nRecruits leave those those are the worst moment to [noise] er some horrible for\nHis thoughts\nJune twenty seventh Robert ... rose convicted for the murder of silk dumplings ski he's given the maximum sentence he's given twenty five years to life in a maximum security prison how ... how did that feel for you\nRelief you know it's over would\nThen it up to the injury itself in there and to ... to determine which charges they should bring against the two attorneys ... pretty soon after the ...\nOur money indulge you learn that they could be facing criminal charges no one's really sure exactly what those might be but it could be something like tampering with evidence obstruction of justice or\nStates public health law and the provision that says the body must be given quick in decent burial and on top of that\nGroup where\nThere was an ethical complaint filed against our money in Belgium so basically they were then facing disarmament an investigation into the ethical complaint that would drag on several years\nSpelled G started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida or money talked it out but he suffered a no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or was like you know well what else can I Do\nTo make a living he was just barely getting by for a little while I think the older the stress and pressure to ...\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on but eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar is that\nWhat Belgian or money did was write\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was look\nFeast does what does this is what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go with you here are just was a lawyer to do the job [noise]\nUh ... I was a good lawyer ...\nThrough art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and build you did a good body is case it's taught in schools across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if people say\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just\nStand up [noise] um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\nMm\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I\nWrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan\nWas the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mind you know as as\nExplain before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew the law schools were teaching and and if you had any feelings about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI don't think it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um did did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing\nWe flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh when we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend\nWhat his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who was um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far is to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did\nIt was a total Eli the lawyer maybe he considered it to the ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of\nOf horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law
