the article was published something else happened something spanned never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness Shia driven may and if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness itself so weird like it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nI did begin to reply but I didn't I\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and\nThat sort of there there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like a really read things up [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was set\nThe state would put pause

prosecution had lied to cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want\nPaul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it\nIt's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nWe're not doing leisure to done to begin with for not following my good for not drying [noise]\nLeads to an air show\nAnd it's even the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you\nEntered object will remain unnerved until it has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue it reads and I hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward\nMr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply shows or forward originally email to spin the ones you send two years ago the one who can stop thinking about\nWhat I read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks ... for the article and says she shared it with her son\nCartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that fed\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little\nBut what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\nJoking I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get back to ... some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK Marilyn\nLives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering a food that she can stop refusing view on the coffee or tea Maryland is a child in stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black\nShe sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always life of the party I mean I was a jokester\nAll make sure you have Marilyn there 'cause she's going to keep the policy going I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people who you can call me in the middle of the night you\nKnow if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn she'd get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person everyday she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly

we revisit a charge of it it is not very pleasant what we try and take for example our next guest when he was a teenager he started reading the biography of David been gory in the first prime minister of Israel and one of the things that he learned is that all of his life David Ben Gurion kept a\nDiary and the whole package seemed like a good idea job diary\nThird Nineteen eighty six Wednesday another fascinating day in the life of Adam Davidson I have a math test tomorrow I'm going to school early to tutor a girl in my class for the aforementioned test\nMy math class a joint pre calculus and calculus class consists mainly of seniors not especially interested in learning I guess that I'm the quote class expert unquote and then I always do the math problems which no one else can\nAnd for this I'm disliked\nI guess that because I apply myself think clearly and do a little work as well as some and tell us\nHelping out I Am a geek in truth I'm far from it when you first um ... read that to yourself when you first side of your reaction was it was pure heart [noise]\nRecently Adam Davidson and occasional contributor to our program found his old high school diaries\nAdams mama's Israeli status American and grew up in New York [noise] body was in New York [noise]\nHis brain as the diaries reveal somewhere else entirely\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary that it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel\n[laughter] to me [laughter] um\nThat that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know\nThe the thought of a young Zionists as he prepared is way to meet his nation\nAnd there are a regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp\nThat was right before I started writing this diary\nGreatly me another sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me\nOne thing if the lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world stop worrying about money and well being I Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam\nAnd wash out will generate here comes out of it was on Capitol [laughter]\n[laughter] wow [laughter] [noise]\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership\n[laughter] no that's a that's it's kind of amazing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] amazing that here I Am the prime minister of Israel in in what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably ... funds recite that at some point or the ball game or something and that the thing is you're right exactly [laughter] [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything in the world including Jews go along with it entirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing\nWas powerful and persuasive to anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy\nOf you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and\nYou know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that\nBut I don't know I mean maybe the maybe keeping a diary where when tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation ...\nTo actually make up a little fantasy ... yeah I think um I didn't have much anxious about\nBeing the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much ... every other aspect of my life\n[laughter] I Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ...\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people was was getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions\nWon't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation\nYou know just have your petty little craft and you're putting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nWhat you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true
