show\nI'm so excited you asked me yeah it's great so you have a new album ... but we're going to get\nTo that in a minute but I was interested to find out that you know you've been playing for a long time but you got a drum kit when\nYou were five years old yeah that was my first instrument I was in love with Ringo Starr\nSomehow my parents convinced me that the guitar was a much nicer instrument and now with a gifted to you as a five year old you know one of those things where someone's like ha ha ha really drunk yes I just wanted to be a drummer really and and so they're like okay we're going to get you a little kid and then they decided you know\nAnd so at what point did you start playing guitar so right afterwards so I I my first guitar I had an electric guitar and I had a big gap and I was like about\nTwo feet high really yeah I was a shredder from right from the beginning of right from the beginning and then when did it turn into this is my profession this is what I'm doing for my loving my career forever\nOh not till I dropped out my third year of college okay so you go to ... yeah I thought like who makes a living doing these are yeah\nRight no so you know what happened\nOn my third year I went to Spain and my friends and I decided well let's go bus go on the streets and I had all these songs that I'd written but they were my personal journals and and it was the first time I ever sang and it was the first day was saying on the street and some guy walked by and he said would you like to play my nightclub\nAnd if we we thought like a you know young American girls and it ended up being legitimate and I wonder if that guy had\nWalked by what would have how would I be doing and how was that gig in Spain\nAnd it was fantastic so then that when you were inspired should you're like this is it does is it okay so\nYou have engaged your fan base to help you find your projects you actually you did this within ... kills you also did the same thing with California years originally when you put it out called ... next record\nLabel before a Kickstarter right in fact I was one of the first to do a kind of tiered level I had polished rock to weapons grade plutonium\nAnd uh and in fact the guys from Kickstarter they before they started they had meetings like\nHow did you how you do and I'm a ... what an idiot why didn't I think they're going to be as it is or not but it was fantastic so ... what did you do it on a just a Web page or how did I had a friend we just did it because I knew I wasn't going to get a record deal the big one and I\nI have small but mighty fan base and and uh\nAnd and I had no idea what what happened what would happen\nAnd so the response was great you're like I'm actually doing an album hair people's paid for it yeah and then uh I mean so what year was that two thousand nine thousand eight two thousand and eight it's clearly different than doing it now ah how I mean how has it changed between doing it then and now with\nYour current credit forever to do because back I was so scared that I Do as well because back then there was you know now you're inundated by people saying you know help them with their ... their everything yet so there was nothing else like that\nCNN and other news sources were interested like what is the so I got a lot of publicity for work and you know what I stopped\nAt a certain level because ... ... yeah he put up this really mean ugly picture of me with the dollar signs saying greedy greedy greedy awful Jill so we'll you know asking are fans and so I quit it and then six months later everyone starts doing it right or\nWhat a different time for a donation upgrade\nYes uh yes oh my God yeah right so now you're doing it you know for your last album ah in the beginning you know you don't have the the whole infrastructure now with a very clear that you have to offer your fans something kind of authentic and cool as a reward for\nFunding right yeah so I tried to do at this time like last time yeah so I had some pretty interesting ones so what did you offer people well as a joke I had my highest level was I Will put on the record and you will be forever my personal
