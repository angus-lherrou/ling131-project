[{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WABE", "content": "And that is also causing you know in addition to the media aspects of it um you know these unconscionable events that are happening throughout the world not just in the United states throughout the world\nFor for ... what's ... what's why responsibilities and in the news media do we you know there was this talk of well you all are always putting would said politician is saying you're always every ... every time Donald Trump tweets y'all report it every time Donald Trump does is your report it are we doing too much\n[noise] yeah I think that's a really good question I also agree with um the previous a gas this is not only a media story this is primarily political story and these killers could have had a mental illness could have access to guns that there shouldn't have there is this is true but we live in a\nA ... over the last couple of years in a political environment where previously all of these thoughts may have been present but these people didn't act now they act in an environment where previously and think about things I think about because they're hearing them from the highest perch from the office\nSo there was supposed to be any of the media is still really three political speech and the way it is not all rallies are equal if you have somebody inciting violence talking about slender reporters against the wall talking about lock her up talking about inviting people to hack\nTheir opponents servers this is no longer a political rally this is this is a hate speech and incitement to violence and I think the media should reported but couch it in that language and then I'll I'll\nStick with you for a second and we'll also would rule and I think you just answered that politicians can play I'm thinking back to in a ... then candidate Obama and McCain we're in a in a McCain was speaking and a woman who called that these things about Obama and and you know sort of became said no\nThat's not true imagine this look this looks like a hundred years ago we have moved so beyond the basic understanding of political opposition as political position as political competition politics is about competing but we no longer think about it that way we have changed\nUnderstanding of politics for the last couple of years to do for politics to be about domination\nWith all means necessary about hating your opponents as if they're no longer are human beings I mean I think we really have to understand it a solution to this crisis that we're in is a political one it's a crisis of leadership it's a crisis on understanding what this country was built about it\nTo some understanding what democracy is\nGoing to let them or you want to chime in and let me say something about the McCain situation liberal when he was talking with the lady when she said what she believes ... about rock among the very minute he told her your sources are incorrect what'd you believe is wrong her entire view watch her entire life\nUnfolding in that very moment we have to say to people what you believe is wrong this things that happened\nOver the last Seventy two hours and was a mental health people deal with mental issues every day they don't go out and they don't murder they don't kill even off their meds they don't destroy society so we can't keep run into it ... it might be able to have let's just stop looking for that\nAll of these people not only did they have a social media trail\nUm the description of the shooter the synagogue shooter was high they said Hi criminal they've had other acts and just like the caller Lou I'm guessing the phones that there's so much already there that went and checked and it also does go unchecked in the media okay if they've got\nA rap sheet a track record all of these things that didn't happen in the social media sites\nWhy wasn't that in the media why wasn't it before why was suppressed why is there a great suppression that goes on in our\nMedia and we find out oh the FBI noses ... these people they've been following them for years they've had incident after incident that they continue to be able to exist in our society and you got certain sectors of society that don't want to see these things punishment because of how it makes their community look\nSo they bring these people back into their community and these things continue to happen\nFor the burden we talk about the message and the messenger do you think people are making some distinction there between well this is my candidate so he or she must be right as opposed to really focusing on let me look at the message and then let me fact checked on my own or folks just paying attention to the messenger 'cause that's the cameras of their political party\nI mean it's absolutely the messenger or you know it's a people I call it willful ignorance a lot of people will forever and it's the unwillingness to do the ... the work the heavy lifting that we have to do\n'em in order to figure out what people are actually saying you know people are able to I was which looking at political ad today and I will say well it was but they were clearly I mean it was\nAbout four lives back to back and I made that deduction because I turned around and went to the ... the candidates website and I read the Web site that was produced by the candidate and all of it uh that was in that ad was challenged based on what that candidate put out\nUm and so I think that people have to think for themselves as stopped following um you know these folks who are just\nReally run by power they want power they want to um wield the power over other individuals and they really don't care about you they don't care about you are getting arrested ultimately they're not coming to get you out of jail like you think that they are\nUm and then you know as the previous guest said from the Southern Poverty Law Center you know the folks and as the social media experts is that people just re brand themselves and they start all over again\nUm but we can track what they have been doing and what they've been saying um and so I think that we have to definitely address this whole idea of people just not doing the work like you have to think for yourselves\nProfessor how much power is airing them in in in the narrative and and political speech professionally and how much power isn't there\nIt's unlimited and I think what we have seen over the last Seventy two hours is what happens when you have the strongest people in the country used political narrative and political language to incite violence\nAs we wrap up will ... Pittsburgh will the events of the tree of life Senegal we'll let\nSpur any action to change any of this and your lawn and gab fly understand now gab is already found a new hosting provider mhm you know from that platform\nThing I ... in one of the tips you played earlier that um it was mentioned sixteen Nineteen Nineteen Nineteen twenty Nineteen or twenty Nineteen next year is something we're watching very closely in when we track storms we track all this we're looking at what um the\nJanette from an experiment that happened um years ago to the year two thousand caught we live in public twenty Nineteen is going to be a critical time for that\nEverybody having an audience everybody having a ... ah some of the things that we're going to see a Nineteen Seventy to twenty twenty that's fifty years since Vietnam Kent State and you talk about what today sounds like it sounds like that time\nAnd so we got to look and see what we do then I like the one of your shows earlier went back to Mr Rogers and said if you want to find the hope uh look for the helpers we need to turn the lens on their helpers right now\nProfessor burden book Pittsburgh change anything I Wish I could be as helpful as you'll into 'em but I cannot know we are we live in a country whose foundation is based on racism or sexism then a phobia the oppression of many groups of people\nUh and so we deal with that and we started actually doing something about it it's always going to continue this is not new it's not you know people were like oh my God how did this happen in America have you looked at this country over the last two hundred years like have we really looked at what we do what who we are\nIt's going to happen again and it's going to continue to happen and so we make some very specific changes and I like uh you land is I'm suggesting that is a good a suggestion but until we start doing the hard work of looking at and accepting who we really are as a country as our national identity\nIt is still and rife with violets\nAnd the perpetuation of it no nothing is going to change ... what do you think\nI absolutely agree with professor Britain and I also think what's really important to call things as they are which is why I started by saying that I don't always think that everything has two sides oh well you wouldn't be the first\nOne [laughter] only the social media person I have to hope that you still think connected over to your land here\nIn single burden you land allow to march ... thank you all for being part of this program I really appreciate it thank you very much [noise]\nAnd that's it for today's program closer look is produced by Candace Wheeler ... Brock and grace Walker engineer for today's chicken bulky\nAs always we thank our digital services grew if you missed any of the day showed you can always find the tarp program on line and WB eat out or slash closer look and of course listen to a close look weak nights at nine PM stay tuned in any point one WB Atlantis choice for NPR I'm Rose Scott [noise]\n\nSo the synagogue shooting rubber ... criticized Trump for calling himself a nationalist now are saying he's not a nationalist he's globalized globalized a buzz word for Jewish\nYes the global is is a is definitely a buzz word for Jewish um and I was worried that the president himself and and many people close to him have used often that the final campaign ad\nOf of Donald Trump's presidential campaign was it was a criticism against global is with a picture of George Soros and five others all Jewish um you know with the with the the star of David also on this campaign ad and global is is is absolutely a code word for talking about about Jews particularly in the white nationalist world why\nBecause they believe the Jews have worked their way into huge global power and you know and it's interesting to read these white nationalist sites because\nThey they speak of Jews almost as if I'm Jews are this is sort of evil superhero with huge amounts of power they say that Jews have worm to their way in their words into control over the u._s. government over Hollywood over over huge international banks and and\nThey believe that it's through this globalism the Jews are required enough power to begin to weaken the white race\n[noise] getting back to to balance the shooting he criticized him for being too accommodating of Jewish influence and I'm Wondering here\nIs it's confusing to white nationalists to feeling the one hand that as you put it Trump is kind of winking at them with language like calling himself a national that's been on the other hand you son in law Jared is Jewish\nA daughter of bunker converted to Judaism Trump right now has two Jewish grandchildren so you know you get a sense of white nationalist or a little confused\nAbout how to read the president\nI think that they are a little bit confused but it's the confusion that they're happy to live with because until this recent administration and white nationalist were widely condemned over the last fifty years by every politician or with any power in the country and and and now they feel like they have a politician who sort of is doing this dance of\nEmpowering some of their ideas speaking about some of their ideas but doing it with with enough room to provide himself distance from the real racism and history of bloodshed that's at the heart of the movement um\nSo I think white nationalist they do not believe that Donald Trump is a white nationalist at they don't think that he exactly identifies with their ideology but they think that he agrees with a lot of their ideas and that he's breathing real power into a lot of those ideas in a mainstream political space\nAnd in that context they're happy to be confused\nThe social media platform the towers used is called gab and it sounds like it's the alternative social media platform for people who are basically thrown off of Twitter or Facebook because of their racist anti Semitic statements so what can you tell us about\nGap is pretty small and and the social media space I mean I think it's about a half million users um but uh it really embraces this\nSort of radical idea of free speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones that conspiracy theorists who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't doesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people I'm gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab you know I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the message is only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages\nHe was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at the synagogue I'm\nIn storefront is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son so so\nWhat are you reading on storm front now\nThere are some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storefronts um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our ... and a choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either done or Derrick black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think that he's heartbroken uh and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens\nHe feels in small ways Gulf War and he wanders um you know how much the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism plays into ... incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating a phrase white genocide and to to popular I think the movement to then have somebody\nGo into a synagogue and murder eleven people\nAnd leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nEliza ... who is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Darren black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Garrett black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\n\nAfternoon this is fresh air on Monday point one W. A. B. lens choice for in the [noise]\nCity live we have two very different take on here in\nThe fall through the ages the west Side Story in the Atlanta Shakespeare come to me the luggage scale as\nAs rights is going to be a mom W ...\n\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe'd like to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we mounting those views when he was twenty two he\nHelped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from Garret blackouts\nThe subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included fast though the first question was addressed to dark black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning like people are better than white\nNational not nationalism kind of turned it down to you it's like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race is like yeah but in particular I ever earned white nationalism is it that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was far it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he found that storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was a not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCandidate for a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nBut by feeding that sense of grievance and by plane to these ideas of your country is being taken away or things are changing this is turning into a place that you don't recognize we don't need this kind of immigration we don't want these signs in Spanish\nThat has a huge effect ah with with a lot of voters and and it's what got Derek elected and it is it's what has gotten other politicians elected in our country as well\nWithout identifying as white nationalist without outright saying hey I'm a white nationalist the race issue because I haven't read it uh-huh\nRight I think I think most most white people that do not want to be called racist and but many white people do have racist views and by\nHaving these conversations when they're not explicitly about race and and they don't involve slurs white nationalist can connect with a certain number of voters Derek and his father did some things to the fact that I I thought were really interesting and reporting the book\nOne of which is they storm front invested a lot of money into recording some country CDs there were slightly more explicitly white pride then or\nWhat you'd see in mainstream country music and they would go to a big country concerts there were attended by majority white crowds in the south or an Allen Jackson concert somewhere in the deep south and they were going to the parking lot and they would hand out the CDs sort of subtly spreading these messages of more white pride songs to an audience that they thought was going to be more receptive to that message\nSo we were talking about how white supremacy kind of a ... was re branded into white nationalism and the goal of white nationalism is to separate the races\nOther ways that white white nationalist racism has been re branded and Derek I mean among the things that I think you try to do was take some of the violence out of the rhetoric so can you talk about that a little that\nI think one of the most effective things that I and some people I was working with a pretty small little group of people who I met while doing Internet radio we would\nOrganize little teams that are apparently on line it's ... that would go to any article that anything to do with race and post some carefully done talking points uh we developed things like the phrase white white genocide\nSaying that all all non white immigration into white countries as white genocide and would talk about white pride would talk as things like saying anti racism is a code word for anti white and try to keep people on pretty tight talking points\nAnd send them out to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was happening because we were focused really intently on changing the language and I'm trying to make it comfortable for people who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white nationalist said\n[noise] I find really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence and violent language in rhetoric out of a white nationalism or white supremacy\nAnd yet there you are describing that you were trying to emphasize that\nImmigration would lead to white genocide\nThat white people make these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against you\nSo it's still the language and finds you just change to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and they are and fat in the in the end of this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting in the comments section and that quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nTo being attacked it's not like all the immigrants who are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know when the ... quote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the endpoint the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and you're racist nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nUh and huge debates would come on on storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how to we're going to define who is white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time and there's no biological\nWine because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually wide by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick

now are said he's not a nationalist he's a global is its global is the buzz word for Jewish\nYes the global is is a is definitely a buzz word for Jewish um and I was worried that the president himself and and many people close to him have used often that the final campaign ad\nOf of Donald Trump's presidential campaign was it was a criticism against global is with a picture of George Soros and five others all Jewish um you know with the with the the star of David also on this campaign ad and global is is is absolutely a code word for talking about about Jews particularly in the white nationalist world\nWhy because they believe the Jews have worked their way into ...\nHuge global power and you know and it's interesting to read these white nationalist sites because\nThey they speak of Jews almost as if I'm Jews are this\nIs sort of evil superhero with huge amounts of power they say that Jews have worm to their way in their words into control over the u._s. government over Hollywood over over huge international banks and and they believe that it's through this globalism the Jews are required enough power to begin to weaken the white race\n[noise] getting back to to balance the shooting he criticized President Trump or being too accommodating of Jewish influence\nAnd I'm Wondering here is it's confusing to white nationalists to feeling the one hand that as you put it Trump is kind of winking at them with language like calling himself a nationalist bent on the other hand\nHis son in law Jared is Jewish\nUh ... daughter of bunker converted to Judaism Trump right now has two Jewish grandchildren so you know you get the sense of white nationalist or a little confused\nAbout how to read the president\nI think that they are a little bit confused but if the confusion that they're happy to live with because until this recent administration am white nationalist were widely condemned over the last fifty years by every politician or with any power in the country and and and now they feel like they have a politician who sort of is doing this dance of\nEmpowering some of their ideas speaking about some of their ideas but doing it with with enough room to provide himself distance from the real racism and history of bloodshed that's at the heart of the movement and\nSo I think white nationalist they do not believe that Donald Trump is a white nationalist at they don't think that he exactly identifies with their ideology but they think that he agrees with a lot of their ideas and that he's breathing real power into a lot of those ideas in a mainstream political space\nAnd in that context they're happy to be confused\nThe social media platform that Bowers used is called gab and it sounds like it's the alternative social media platform for people who are basically thrown off of Twitter or Facebook because of their racist anti Semitic statements so what can you tell us about gap\nThat gap is\nSmall and and the social media space I mean I think it's about a half million users and but uh it really embraces this sort of radical idea of free speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones that conspiracy theorists who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have there is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab yeah and I think the danger of a place like gab and also the danger of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have these ideas\nTo sort of cultivate their own reality and Bowers when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nI'm In storefront is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founder son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nAre some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storm front over over the last decade\nAnd and the reaction is mostly that\nWell it's probably isn't quite the way to go about it he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter and stuff\nBut are are over with and uh Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done or Derrick black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um and I think that he's heartbroken and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens\nHe feels small waves Gulf War and he wanders um you know how much the re messaging that he did in terms of white nationalism plays into ... incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and said to popularize the movement to then somebody\nGoing to a synagogue and murder eleven people\nAnd leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a ... I think it's it's ...\n... is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek Black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air [noise]\nIs ... ... one W.

shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nGoing to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we noun sing those views when he was twenty two he\nHelped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from\nDerek Black is the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli Sasha slow who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included ... the first question was addressed to dark black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front called that a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing\nEverybody and that that's the that wasn't what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nThirty to forty percent of white Americans believe that they experience more discrimination and weren't prejudiced than people of color or then Jews which is factually incorrect by every measure that we have\nBut by feeding that sense of grievance by plane to these ideas of your country is being taken away a things are changing this is turning into a place that you don't recognize we don't need this kind of immigration we don't want these signs in Spanish\nThat has a huge effect at with with a lot of voters and and it's what got Derek elected and it is it's what has it gotten other politicians elected in our country is well\nWithout identifying as white nationalist without outright saying hey I'm a white nationalist the race issue 'cause I haven't read it uh-huh\nRight I think I think most most white people that do not want to be called racist and but many white people do have racist views and by\nHaving these conversations when they're not explicitly about race and and they don't involve slurs white nationalist can connect with a certain number of voters Derek and his father did some things to the fact that I I thought were really interesting and reporting the book\nOne of which is they stormed front invested a lot of money into recording some country CDs there were slightly more explicitly white pride than\nWhat you'd see in mainstream country music and they would go to a big country concerts that were attended by majority white crowds in the south or an Allen Jackson concert somewhere in the deep south and they would go into the parking lot and they would hand out these CDs sort of suddenly spreading these messages of more white pride songs to an audience that they thought was going to be more receptive to that message\nSo we were talking about how white supremacy kind of a ... was rebranded into white nationalism and the goal of white nationalism is to separate the races there are other ways that white\nWhite nationalist racism has been re branded and Derek I mean among the things that I think you try to do was take some of the violence out of the rhetoric so can you talk about that on that\nI think one of the most effective things that I and some people I was working with a pretty small little group of people who I met while doing Internet radio we would organize little teams that are apparently on line it's wads\nThat would go to any article that anything to do with race and post some carefully done talking points are we developed things like the phrase white white genocide\nSaying that all all non white immigration into white countries as white genocide and would talk about white pride talk as things like saying anti racism is a code word for anti white and tried to keep people on pretty tight talking points\nAnd send them out to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was\nJoining because we were focused really intently on changing the language and I'm trying to make it comfortable for people who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white nationalist said\nI find it really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence and violent language in rhetoric out of a white nationalism a white supremacy\nAnd yet Garrett you were describing that you were trying to emphasize that immigration would lead to white genocide\nThat white people like these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against due\nSo it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and who they are exactly in the end of this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting and the comments section and that quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people who are making society worse\nGetting back to being attacked it's not like all the immigrants who are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be ... quote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that you know the entire ideology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean that you want to separate people have different races and different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they do they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalists when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never republic uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who is white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even

Jewish people there you actually try to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you

have a great deal of council 'cause there's not a lot of folks who do this yeah there wasn't somebody I can call and say you know I'm thinking about it so I jumped in and I became a donor first because I wanted to do something\nAnd there was a little tab that said you know click here if you may join us in fact I just was looking I was just looking in a couple of hours later um I was halfway through the application process and houses and I I don't know\nI don't know I didn't know but then a few months later there was a opening in Sudan there was nobody who could go and that that\nThat spoke to me I hadn't done orientation hadn't been HR none of that stuff\nAnd they said we know you haven't done any of those things are you willing to go and I'm a Texan has been a day that was friday and I left on Thursday what year was a two thousand eleven on baby girl as a year and some change old I had breast milk in the freezer [noise]\nUm but it felt like the right thing to the idea that there was nobody spoke to me\nYou go to Sudan and then and then what do you see when you arrive\nOh there was so many things that were unfamiliar I had never been anywhere I\nHad and I never been across the Atlantic ocean we didn't go camping I didn't know any of that stuff I mean I\nI was I was lost in terms of the culture and the and the life of in this kind of work [laughter] um but\nWhat is true across the world is as soon as I get to that place where the patients are I Know exactly where I Am because you're a doctor yet I can I can I Do no matter where you go [laughter]\nYou know big bellies and and wailing in the distance that that's where I feel comfortable that's my that's where I live alone and then your second tour I that that's a that's not the word you know [laughter] but your your second\nYeah so the second time I'm the first time was you know special 'cause it's per se but it was also because Sudan and South Sudan were scheduled to succeed so they were I was there for a new country being born and I felt connected to the people there and and the [noise]\nThe other staff that were there I felt like I I could come back and help out if they needed me but I hadn't you know so the bucket list thing ... to go\nUp orders but it spoke to me it felt the opposite of the questions I had at home like am I supposed to be here is this worth ... this week I had in store for me and all of that was gone and I'll say oh this is exactly where I'm supposed to be exactly what I'm supposed to be doing\nThen as I mentioned coming into the segment you know often you all are in in areas where there is conflict or there's been conflict arguing midst of the conflict very much obviously extreme poverty in you know sometimes politics gets in a way how did you maneuver through all that or you just focus on what you do as a doctor\nThat the political arena is is part of why I joined Doctors Without borders because it's a level playing field it doesn't matter whose team you're on who started it who broke the ceasefire all of that is irrelevant and I think it makes it easier to do what I Do and the next patient needs me and this is what I Do and it doesn't matter\nWhere they came from or what uniform there where\nHere in this country you are used to having everything that you need in terms of physician your fellow being OBGYN you'd have everything that you need all the instruments from the table to everything but when you're halfway around the globe do they make sure you have as best as possible everything that you need and I'm sure that that can be challenging to\nI Am a particular surgeon my mother was a scrub nurse so I I Know what I like and and I don't I don't make any bones about making that clear but each and every time that I needed something special or injure kid or specialize it was available and I I appreciate that as\nYou know I'm On the board and I'm I'm I'm part of Doctors Without borders in a global fashion that I you know not just the search insist really making sure that we're doing right by people across the world and that is where I Begin I feel like if I go into the or and what I Need is air than we are doing this thing right\nAnd you you've completed for surge golden I'm\nFive now yeah five ... who was the last ... last one was South Sudan itself so um this new country has you know needs of its own and and things have changed since I was first there but the patients don't change their mommies worried about their babies that never changes never change from that to go\nWith this new interactive exhibit in\nTour we hope people will get out and you're also considered a guy so take me through what what are you doing here\nThe idea is [noise] I Would say it's a chance for us to tell those stories that won't be hurt otherwise part of Doctors Without borders is this idea in French it's called ... guys who are fringe organization and they were different in that\nYou can't just come home and go back to your regular life there's a there's an obligation as a as an impetus to tell stories\nInfringe it means to bear witness to testify really so this is our version of that this is when people say if you see something that's not right to say something and this is an amalgamation of all of our stories like we come back and when we're together\nWe share these stories that are painful and an extraordinary [noise]\nWe want it to be able to share that with people who who don't aren't as close to the refugee crisis they don't know anybody who's going through this but we say you don't you don't know people who are refugees but you remember house fires back in the seventies and eighties\nWe got our close together my mom made us find pictures with that person kid in it because they wouldn't have any they were lost and the fire all of those networks are very similar except that they're gone in a civil war that people don't have their neighbors and\nFriends to rely on they don't have a way to get to the hospital when they're very very ill so that part of it is\nThat's the part that universal that you that you see it looks different in another language it sounds different\nAnd the images that we might see in news reports of what we might hear on NPR BBC is one thing\nBut this interactive exhibits ... it takes to visit or\nThe person through all of this through your lives yeah and you all are telling the story\nRight so we start with the patients that need ... where where can we be somewhere that they can get to us so we talk about the logistics of\nWhereas here where can we get clean water well how can we get medicines that have to be under you know Seventy degrees Fahrenheit at all times how do we make sure that the vaccines could hit on time that we have bandages and suture and all of those things so the exhibit is a great way\nTo see this crisis through our eyes the things that are familiar to us the setting up the breaking down to finding the patients and and in so doing we get a chance to tell their story\nIt's selfish to ask how do you all\nBalance how do you all cold\nBecause you're seeing some extra listen we see extreme poverty here in this country but you all are also seen extreme poverty on another level with a whole lot of one of the issues tied to it how do you balance that\nWe have each other I think and and that comes across when you're at the exhibit you realize it\nAt any time I could raise my voice and three people will turn to see what I mean because we are used to being a team and in the field there's no\nNobody is at all concerned about my academic credentials sometimes what they needed somebody who can run to the blended fast yeah and that part of it is is is where you also find your your nurturing and you're carrying because people people know how hard it is I\nTalked to sort of you you and I guess I imagine that maybe you've had to deal with last too\n[noise] yeah\nThat's the thing that comes with being an obstetrician when it's good it's good oh man there's nothing like stealing that first kids from a newborn there's nothing like it when it's bad if it's a it's equally awful\nI met my first maternal death was in Sudan and it had never happened had been around ... you know ... in the hospital I knew a lady who you know what I mean but not\nIn my arms in my hand and I didn't know what to do I didn't know what to do it I had never happened that don't speak the language\nAnd culturally speaking almost entirely unprepared for and how it goes so that part I mean it's hard but we have each other this exhibit is uh the Georgia wrote Congress center yes the west plaza part yeah right outside of buildings see\nWhat do you want people to know about this exhibited and\nEncourage him to take it's free it's free so y'all y'all liked it what do you want people to know about this\nUm this is this is a chance for\n\nAtlanta and to see what is missing in the talk ... ... what's on television and in papers is different than looking a person in their face who is terrified about losing their baby\nAnd that never changes but they have no hospital nearby so I've I've had patients that have thought were\n... you know in labor bleeding leading leading and but because she was sitting crisscross applesauce it was her feet that were bleeding she had walked to the hospital that far pregnant with her other little baby with her and I'm like man I\nKnow how hard I can fight for my children I Know I Will but seeing someone who's who's only goal is to get to the hospital and I\nI'm always amazed and I always and encouraged by motherhood because this is this is the same everywhere [noise]\nTalked to Africa Stuart thank you for each do thank you for your work and in Atlanta based OBGYN insurgent who was competed for surgical sign as an African she's with Doctors Without borders that interactive exhibits ... thank you so much for coming in and I think to appreciate it [noise]\nForgetful show everybody likes the\nSenate if he's going to abolish the national park system\n[laughter] that's so great my middle ground which turned out it is ... ... what do you think listening back to ... I it's strange\nTo hear back I forgot I'm just kind of how truly absurd it it was and yet kind of true to form so I also rattling I always wanted\nTo know whose idea was it for you to play Spicer did they call you it's that the Senate life folks call you and ask you to do it or did you suggest the idea to them [noise]\nNo my no I did not suggested I Would never ever have thought of that in a million years um my friend can sublet that's I'm One of the head writers at us and now that I Know you know going back to the ground links theater in Los Angeles uh\nHe called and said would you ever come in and do Spicer I wrote something that I I think you can play and I was like what the the what I Can't play him I don't\nI don't do in person nations I'm not a man I don't know I have I have no interest it's not in my wheelhouse and he just kept saying you know I think could do it I think you know it was just coming can I can I send that you to read\nAnd I I think I said I don't think it's quite my thing and and then I Believe the next day I saw\nAnother rather you know insane press conference where I thought well this is weirder than anything I could actually do like we can't even we can't even match it on us and now it's so absurd and I just thought\nOkay I'm going to come in and read it and talk to you guys about it and\nYou know I think and then the the real humbling blow as I thought well how how long is it going to take like can can we even get me to look like him and the really lovely um special effects guy there just said oh yeah that's not gonna be hard at all that'll take like a half an hour\nWhich I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to a man but that really was it and they got it down to like you know at one point we were doing it and like you know Fifteen minutes but\nIt was just thought to I think I get the feel I started to think may maybe it's time to kind of hold hold the mirror up and see if anyone realized just how kind of ridiculous they're being\nSo one of the things that that you became famous for within that sketches the moving podium which you kind of Dr aggressively [laughter] reporters and then there was like one a one sketch we actually drove it down was the Fifth Avenue in Manhattan\nWe were all over Manhattan in that podium which was very surreal\nShooting it I I think I pitched it at one point of you know do we go\nWe have sale end to the to the sunset and I think I just actually thought it would be fun to drive kind of a Segway podium around Manhattan I didn't think they would ever let me do it all is said why is that what it was on\nWell it was kind of based on that some you know these incredible people built this whole rig so it was kind of a podium sitting on a a Segway type of contraption but they built they built this whole thing and and rigged it but\nAnd it was weird there were just\nYou know all up and down the streets there were all these people watching and then you could I'd look up into the building and just see you know hundreds of people kind of press against the glass and I thought this is the most surreal moment I'll probably ever have\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she's now starring in the new movie can you ever forgive me so we'll be right back after a break this is fresh air\nGet a bit of ... in ... city lie beyond this we'll rent so and I think a quartet violin is Jessica ... who\nWill join us head to their upcoming performance the world's most celebrated venue the concern about\nI'm Lois bright Foose joy\nEight pm on double your ab ...\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me which is based on a memoir by Lee Israel\nWho when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene\nWhen the right in the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dresses yet um you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive down that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene and part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can\nAnd it really wasn't the point of it oh okay no no\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled at it and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to terminated for more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we're things like this do happen they said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like yeah look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] with him to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes because your mind is really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't\nIntended and it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible in wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character mhm and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMost McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise] is um insults [laughter] insulting\nOh no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter]\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they were all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the ... the other ... couple have threatened you so you're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that same it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said\nIt was an animal and then if I didn't cheat on a leash than he would hit him\nWith his car did you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do he didn't say All right you know what I said was that\nWe need to keep an extra hour and our kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no when he when he said to me was he called me on what language Catherine let me get a relay what these do not balls to me unless I say it\nCan you please not talk like that Catherine music manager ... next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake bank commercial that's what you look like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIs productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you out in a job with my ... bone you're just really scaring me this is what happens in your corner you corner me I won't you drew you to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it just got back on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but [noise]\nWatching other designer studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching [noise] and then they did stand up one night and I just thought they think I'm gonna go this direction [laughter]\nDo you remember any of the material you did that first night\n[noise] I Do strange I'm sure it was terrible or was it stand up New York I'm for an open Mike and I remember I first of all I hadn't written anything I just kind of got up on state I didn't know that you were supposed to write I mean just oblivious oblivious to any any preparation or [noise]\nAnd I went up on stage and I know I had a big wig on and kind of a very eccentric you know I think it was like a silver metallic\nKind of trench coat dress and\nAnd I remember just starting to talk about being in New York and being so\nTall and and wealthy and having everyone love you so much and I think at first it really through people as um you know it seems so he gets hysterical and narcissistic and I thought oh they're not liking this\nAnd they were harder and I kept complimenting myself more and more but in ways that these were not factual compliments I was saying everything I wasn't\nI had you know Thirteen cents I was not tall I was not fabulous and I'm sought after in New York so I Do remember that feeling of them realizing that I'm making fun of myself I'm not complimenting myself\nAnd then when they started to laugh I just thought oh it's really fun this is really strange and fun and such a title\nBacked of where they didn't like me a minute ago and now I think it's okay and then then I could say anything because they knew it wasn't\nSerious and I think I pulled somebody up on stage and talked about us being engaged and he was clearly there with a date [laughter] and I didn't really know how to do jokes are just kind of\nAgain I went on as a character I went on his missed why I never would have gone on his myself but through a character I could\nBe more ridiculous than more bold and brazen and I would not go and just popped out on someone's lap and talk about how much they love me but as of character I could and I just felt a great freedom in that we do always dress the way you describe a\n... yeah I was completely completely ... in a different I was always in a huge way to some very elaborate\nCostume 'em but oh almost club kitty but not as alternative at that point I was living with a one of my still best friends ... who now as a shoe designer but at the time he was at FIT so he was making all these different clothes so I Would wear you know I Would\nGrab things that he was making for class and we would go out and go do stand up that night and they would throw in one of his like you know we we're Glenn may swing caper some kind of scuba suits thing and it just seemed so fun it was all so much more\nRidiculous and and fun and I just thought well why not what else do you get to wear like a scuba address out\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll

I. A.\nDot org [noise] this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex as one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] ... when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's the one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy\n[laughter] and it was the always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you is any woman ever been like\nMy God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know\nFour and a half minutes and the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shut them now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stop talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler\nGod I don't think it was my favorite I think the more at work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands for women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's the first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there a home body there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching saying times oh my God so\nI Know there's the light oh aerial ever present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light man\nI Would have flashes like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a whole my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the first time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they left he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of like ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know how to keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got off the finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was

Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the ... the other ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that same it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't cheat on a leash than he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do say or even when I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances having to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no when he when he said to me was he called me on what language Catherine language I mean I get a relay what these do not balls said to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul was that there are bank commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIf productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you out in a job with my ... bone you just really scaring me this is what happens in your corner you corner me I won't you drew you to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it just goes\nOn and on with more over the top insult is that's something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and stuff\nYou know I Know I Do not go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I got it all out on on screen but [noise]\nAnd then they did stand up one night and I just thought I think I'm gonna go this direction [laughter] do you remember any of the material you did that first night [noise] I Do strange I'm sure it was terrible or\nWas it stand up New York I'm for an open Mike and I remember I first of all I hadn't written anything I just kind of got up on state I didn't know that you were supposed to write I mean just oblivious oblivious to any any preparation or [noise]\nAnd I went up on stage and I know I had a big wig on and kind of a very eccentric you know I think it was like a silver metallic\nKind of trench coat dress and\nAnd I remember just starting to talk about being in New York and being so\nTall and and wealthy and having everyone love you so much and I think at first it really through people as um you know it seems so he gets hysterical and narcissistic and I thought oh they're not liking this\nAnd they were harder and I kept complimenting myself more and more but in ways that these were not factual compliments I was saying everything I wasn't\nI had you know Thirteen cents I was not tall I was not fabulous and I'm sought after in New York so I Do remember that feeling of them realizing that I'm making fun of myself I'm not complimenting myself\nAnd then when they started to laugh I just thought oh this relief on this is really strange and fun and such a tight rope backed of where they didn't like me a minute ago and now I think it's okay and then then I could say anything because they knew it wasn't\nSerious and I think I pulled somebody up on stage and talked about us being engaged and he was clearly there with a date [laughter] and I didn't really know how to do jokes are just kind of\nAgain I went on as a character I went on his miss why I I never would have gone on his myself but through a character I could\nBe more ridiculous and more bold and brazen and I would not go and just popped out on someone's lap and talk about how much they love me but as this character I could and I just felt a great freedom in that we do always dress the way you described a\n... yeah I was completely completely ... in a different I was always in a huge way to some very elaborate costume 'em but\nOh almost club kiddy but not as alternative at that point I was living with a one of my still best friends Brian out what who now as a shoe designer but at the time he was at FIT so he was making all these different clothes so I Would wear you know I Would\nGrab things that he was making for class and we would go out and go do stand up that night and they would throw in one of his like\nYou know we we're glad may swing caper some kind of scuba suit thing and it just seem so fun it was all so much more ridiculous and and fun and I just thought well why not what else do you get to wear like a scuba address out\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk more if you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she stars in a new movie called can you ever forgive me we'll be right back after this break this is fresh air\nSupport for uh WABC comes from the Atlanta symphony orchestra Donald run uncles returns to

to helping those who are driven by purpose reached their definition of success investing advice banking retirement\nLearn more AT T I Am a dot org\n[noise] this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] ... when you went into a regular comedy clubs something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go clubs club like are you actually the same guy it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your\nTop off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and\nEspecially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shove now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so there is that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler oh God I don't think it was my favorite I think the more work than where I hated it um it usually would dissolve into some kind of\nAbout are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that\nRoad like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who who is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who even though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's the first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there a home body there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching ... times oh my God so\nI Know there's the light oh ... ever present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light man I Would have flash it at like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and be you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a on my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the feeling other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out of there are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they left he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got up to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I now that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles\n[noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional

doesn't I Want to play something from volume one of\nThe Beatles live at the BBC and this is um an interview track with it presented name Bryan Matthew\nAnd does track is titled riding on the bus 'cause it's one of the things that are asked about well it's one of the things actually I think that Paul mentioned [laughter] about the kind of thing you can't do anymore when you're famous uh cause some of his interviews about what it's been like for them to be famous do you want to say a few words about it\n[noise] well yes us food career progressed and they became internationally successful [noise]\nThe nature of the interviews changed or they didn't do so many programs on the BBC it was just how to crime in to the ... costs for the BBC but they remain loyal to such a big club which was presented by brown Matthew\nAnd he was very much respected by the Beatles they grew up listening to him and his very important program started a club and he tried to\nAsk some serious questions and and that was a serious question to which he received a quite serious require I think I mean you do get the first indications of being trapped in this bubble of fame or when you listen to it you know ah [noise]\nThey miss riding on a bus um well pulled us joined us from above ... says [noise] but ah you do get the feeling now that are having made it so big that there are drawbacks to this\nAnd and

I'd like to ask you know first of all do you ever get tired of being bagels\nThose those are the loneliness who now I don't think so really don't know just in case you know you get teased off with

playing the a lot of different sports [noise]\nI I Want to get into ACL injuries because I Know a few years ago there was a report that there were a lot of ACLU injuries being reported in female athletes and so then that got some people saying well no it's because girls don't tend to get to the weight room and tell for some\nSenior junior high school or even college I started lifting weights till college 'cause my coach made me and I did not want to\nPut from your viewpoint those ACL injuries is there something to be said that we see this increase in female athletes under Eighteen\nMm yeah I mean this is actually old data and now we've it's pretty clear young female athletes are anywhere from a few times to almost like eight times more likely to tear their ACL we think it's because of their knee mechanics and that starts like at two or three four five years old\nSo the simple term we call physical literacy do we get our kids to to jump in land and do all these things they should be doing by diversifying their sports and and learning how to be an athlete first rather than just learn the skills only\nAnd we're missing that especially for girls so now we've told girls gosh you could ... gosh you can get a concussion\nGosh now you can get overuse injuries yeah we're not making sports seems so sexy are are we we can get these girls playing sports so I think\nOne thing we something physical as it said yeah you know sports hiking yeah\n... ... in your practice and and you have parents ought to see all the parents are concerned about about these injuries but what do you want to tell parents in terms of what they should be monitoring and watching if the kids are going to be participating in specialized sports although you say not but if you go into what advice can you offer them\nA great question I could say it's like my own kids I could say things ten times in a row it's still going to happen so yeah many kids are gonna still specializing there's probably a good reason and and so we have to work with them and so what do you do recognize things early if you have a day a pain in the high risk area like you're low back your shoulder your wrist\nTake a day off if it lasts a week to take a week off and then after that and see your sports medicine doctor you know if you have a good primary care doctor seem right away and don't be afraid to tell the ...\nMy little one is not coming today there's information on the knee or whatever that I have bad knees now which might have told me to sit down when I was little but no seriously the parents need to exercise that control this their their kids with the somebody's coaches I think\nParents still have to be parents and so you know I've had this conversation coaches and parents you have to empower parents and say look if my child\nLike if something goes wrong at school and something's wrong with their education you go to the teacher teacher right same thing with the coach if your kid is coming home and their limping it's your decision to say you know enough is enough we have to take a day off every week off or or get it checked out and so if you're a child I think in power parents to say make decisions on your child when you think enough is enough\nEmpowering the parents to make the decisions and also for coaches to listen as well\nThere are so many great coaches and let me be completely not anti coach I think coaches are great there's so many well meaning coaches there's only a few and those types and [laughter] ... yeah there's you know I don't know if they are they are nuts if you watch the apple you oughta that Ohio and scary you had me on record for that one\nBut there are so many great coaches and so I think they're really well meaning but we're not asking coaches to be sports medicine physician I worked very closely with coaches it's it's not their role to decide where a high risk or low risk problem is and so I think that's when you have to get engaged with the parents to help facilitate their thing\nAnd if after this programming and take a look at my knee 'cause I've I've been to a Murray over there and you know just for the record for disclosure you're pretty good\nYeah we kind of know or do we make the professional teams in in the whole town but we'll take we take care of everyone so yeah we'll take a look at your hair

him seriously he's a guy you know\nSpends his life looking at little basketball players the funny thing about him is if you go back and look at his towels sheets from five or six years ago and you look at the fifth and sixth graders who reiterated the highest\nLot of them are in big time college basketball now or in the pros so we certainly not write all the time but he's not bad at at picking out the best players so what clerk Francis does whether you take them seriously or not is he lays down a foundation for\nPeople who then scout high school and middle school players and he sort of sets the sort of number of players who may be looked at and\nThe recruiting services are and other business another way that young grass roots or high school players generate income for other people\nNow they're not just watching these kids in school jams right there is something called the grassroots basketball network explain who runs that how it works\nThe main recruiting grounds which I've also heard described as a hunting grounds\nIt's no longer high school basketball you know a high school game\nFeatures maybe one star the kid maybe six six and he's playing against a five ten kid\nSo what's the shoe companies created was the grassroots basketball circuit and that put all the best players against each other in these pressurized situations that's where the college coaches go to scout\nAnd the person who created this ... sometimes called the godfather of grassroots basketball and sunny was a brilliant salesman an a and a brilliant\nSort of hustler in his own way so he realized the two things one was to put all the best players together was going to create a better recruiting situation but he also realize that\nBig time college coaches really don't want to go to small town after small town and scout players they like to go to Las Vegas and stay in five star hotels or go to Chicago Orlando and stay in five star hotels and watch a bunch of the best players so sunny not only put the best players together\nBut he created a situation that's coaches loved\nRight so you had these tournaments that occur uh in Chicago or Orlando or Las Vegas\nWhere the best players come in these prospects these kids their families take the more and we're talking about middle school kids and a lot of cases right\nAnd there are these people who are not agents but you might call them runners street agents who sort of specialize in building relationships you describe a tournament in Las Vegas I think in July you want to just kind of paint that picture forests\nLas Vegas hosts some of the biggest grassroots tournaments so in July you will have\nA couple of hundred teams all age groups and a thousand or more pliers a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they are being scout it not only by coaches not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the fringes I think of it almost like boxing back in the day these sort of Damon Runyon ask characters\nWho are there to sort of see what's in it for them and the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day they're exploited their dealers in human athletic flash and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent and this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known\nAnd it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who refer to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is

E.\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\n[noise] so and a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to\nYou write that on the college end of this is the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches that used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball but you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas in elsewhere\nBut the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids the thinking in the industry and\nAmong journalists and many follow this world is that many of the head coach of say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nI had these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of this story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges [noise]\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in ...\n... to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the intent of the bride is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros\nSend him to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another or get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so if you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that\nAdds up to a whole lot if you were quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you do you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars\nThe book is kind of about this system of corruption and recruitment but Tina is a fascinating character um you say it's not hard to make the case he's the best college basketball coach of his generation that tactical and motivational genius and to give us a sense an example of what he does it special\nRick Pitino one to national championships wanna Kentucky\nAt Louisville he also coached the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks two of the\nMore key franchises in professional basketball in college basketball particularly at Louisville\nHe did something that's almost never done he won with out the best players most final four teams most national champions are stocked with first round draft picks Hi first round draft picks of the NBA which are called lottery picks\nRick Pitino one without those guys he coached\nGood players not great players he got them to play merciless defense they played so intense that he was a motivational on a tactical genius\nAnd you know by the way I Love watching him coach and he would stand on the sideline in in an athletic position with his knees bent\nAnd you know its head peering out over the court often one foot on the court and its hands behind him and I always got the feeling that he put his hands behind him because he was so intense that if it weren't there he would reach out and grab the balls that came by\nBut he was just this amazing coach and in some ways you know that for him to be caught up in this is\nA a predictable and and be\nNow he lost his job he was not charged in the criminal case but ah Louisville overstated and he was given his walking papers after the indictment came out but you're right that this was not his first brush with scandal what were some of the others\nAre more than a decade ago Rick Pitino had a sexual ethic nation in a closed restaurant I'm with a woman who then tried to extort him\n[noise] and she was sent off to prison but he was the star prosecution witness who had to then recount in court\nThis incident with a woman who just met in a bank get everybody left the wrestling was terribly embarrassing and I would say\nAfter that Pitino was just a basketball coach um which of course you always was but I don't think he could be seen as a necessarily a mentor to young men the second incident was in many ways more serious in Louisville it became known as stripper gate\nAnd what struck the gate was was four years of parties in the basketball dorm\nNot very far from ... office sponsored by a local escort and paid for by a member of Pitino staff and women danced and there were sexual favors for recruits and for current players and\nIn the ... in the NC double lays lexicon it's strange lexicon this was ruled to be\nPermissible benefits to amateur players and Louisville actually lost its two thousand Thirteen national title over stripper gate so that was sort of and that was sort of strike one strike to end this recruiting scandal um and Pitino was not charged\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit is involve Louisville\nOoh that was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\n... and in the strip or gay case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees of sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this in the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\nIn stripper gate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says and right now coach Geno has a pending case against\nThe University of

yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing\nParents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at present time that was a shock\n... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke which is quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes

this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nBecause sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't

the nation's first sanctuary state over an hour ago names are deciding whether or not they want to repeal the law comes to some other states including Vermont have adopted sanctuary policies as well some people want the state to conform with federal law but others worry about immigration round ups and police stops\nPublications or online sites that actually rate these players that\nHave a lot of readers\nThere are publications\nAnd scouting services that look at kids as young as fifth grade or one of them is called hope scoop it's run by a man named Clark Francis who I encountered several years ago and you know there are elements of Clark\nWhen you meet him that that you may not take him seriously he's a guy you know\nSpends his life looking at little basketball players the funny thing about him is if you go back and look at his towels sheets from five or six years ago and you look at the fifth and sixth graders who review rated the highest\nLot of them are in big time college basketball now or in the pros so he's certainly not write all the time but he's not bad at at picking out the best players so what clerk Francis does whether you take them seriously or not is he lays down a foundation\nFor people who then scout high school and middle school players and he sort of sets the sort of number of players who may be looked at and\nThe recruiting services are and other business and other way that young grass roots or high school players generate income for other people\nNow they're not just watching these kids in school jams right there is something called the grassroots basketball network explain who runs that how it works\nThe main recruiting grounds which I've also heard described as a hunting grounds\nIs no longer high school basketball you know a high school game\nFeatures maybe one star the kid maybe six six and he's playing against a five ten kid so what's the shoe companies created was the grass roots basketball circuit and that put all the best players against each other in these pressurized situations that's\nWhere the college coaches go to scout and the person who created this ... sometimes called the godfather of grassroots basketball and sunny was a brilliant salesman an a and a brilliant\nSort of hustler in his own way so he realized two things one was that to put all the best players together was going to create a better recruiting situation but he also realized that\nBig time college coaches really don't want to go to small town after small town that scout players they like to go to Las Vegas and stay in five star hotels or go to Chicago Orlando and stay in five star hotels and watch a bunch of the best players so sunny not only put the best players together\nBut he created a situation that's coaches loved\nRight so you had these tournaments that occur I'm In Chicago or Orlando or Las Vegas\nWhere the best players come in these prospects these kids their families take the more and we're talking about middle school kids and a lot of cases right\nAnd there are these people who are not agents but you might call them runners street agents who sort of specialize in building relationships you describe a tournament in Las Vegas I think in July you want to just kind of paint that picture for us\nLas Vegas hosts some of the biggest grassroots tournaments so in July you will have\nA couple of hundred teams all age groups and a thousand or more pliers a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they're being scout at not only by coaches not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the fringes I think of it almost like boxing back in the day these sort of Damon Runyon ask characters who are they're just sort of see what's in it for them\nAnd the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day they're exploited their dealers in human athletic flash and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there there are kids who you know this is their life in one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who refer to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last ten\nPatient of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation

the demands of its growing economy that's tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News waking up Atlanta from six till ten on Ninety point one W. A. B.\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\n[noise] so and a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's that that's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to you write that\nThe college end of this is the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches that used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere\nBut the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids the thinking in the industry and\nAmong journalists and many follow this world\nIs that\nMany of the head coach of say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know these assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep\nTheir hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut she had these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of this story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges [noise]\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players who are already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you and NBA player\nBut of course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so\nIf you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you were quote managing the money of one of these players\nSo Rick Pitino is that the coach was on the cover of the book um\nThe book is kind of about this system of corruption and recruitment but Pitino is a fascinating character um you say it's not hard to make the case he's the best college basketball coach of his generation that tactical and motivational genius and to give us a sense an example of what he does it special\nRick Pitino one to national championships wanted Kentucky won at Louisville\nHe also coached the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks two of the\nMore key franchises in professional basketball in college basketball particularly at Louisville\nHe did something that's almost never done he won with out the best players most final four teams most national champions are stocked with first round draft picks Hi first round draft picks of the NBA which are called lottery picks\nRick Pitino one without those guys he coached\nGood players not great players he got them to play merciless defense they played so intense that he was a motivational and a tactical genius\nAnd you know by the way I Love watching him coach and he would stand on the sideline in in an athletic position with his knees bent\nAnd you know its head peering out over the court often one foot on the court and its hands behind him and I always got the feeling that he put his hands behind him because he was so intense that if they weren't there he would reach out and grab the balls that came by\nBut he was just this amazing coach and in some ways you know that for him to be caught up in this is a a\nPredictable and and be tragic\n[noise] now he lost his job he was not charged in the criminal case but ah Louisville was tainted and he was given his walking papers after the indictment came out but you're right that this was not his first brush with scandal what were some of the others\nAre more than a decade ago Rick Pitino had a sexual ethic nation in a closed restaurant I'm with a woman who then tried to extort him [noise] and she was sent off to prison but he was the star prosecution witness who had to then recount in\nCourt this incident\nA woman who just met in a bank get everybody left the restaurant was terribly embarrassing and I would say\nAfter that Pitino was just a basketball coach um which of course you always was but I I don't think he could be seen as a necessarily a mentor to young men [noise] the second incident was in many ways more serious in Louisville it became known as stripper\nAnd what struck the gate was was four years of parties in the basketball dorm\nNot very far from his office sponsored by a local escort and paid for by a member of Pitino staff and women danced and there were sexual favors for recruits and for current players and\nIn the in in the NC double lays lexicon it's strange lexicon this was rude to be\nIn permissible benefits to amateur players and Louisville actually lost his two thousandth Thirteen national title over stripper gate so that was sort of and that was sort of strike one strike to end this recruiting scandal um and Pitino was not charged\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit is involved Louisville\nMove it was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\nAnd in a stripper gate case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees a sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\nIn stripper gate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says and right now coach Pitino has a pending case against\nThe University of Louisville athletic association which technically paid a salary and he's seeking the thirty five million dollars which was left on his coaching contract\nMike ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college

adviser dot com\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with writer Michael ... whose new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino is about a recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal when these federal and\nMonths were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock\nAnd what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at present time that was a shock\n... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\n\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\n\nYou know I mentioned that they do well and a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so the one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball the legendary Mike chef ski coach K of Duke was quoted as saying\nThis is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach case set it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nWhat kind of sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not", "show_name":
