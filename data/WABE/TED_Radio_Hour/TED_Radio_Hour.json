that we could dream about doing but no one was going to be able to do it because it just seemed like it would never be possible\nSo that now with with CRISPR basically you can just go into the body find that chain of letters causing a disease or something and then just cut out one or two letters and replace it with with the right letter\nAbsolutely that's exactly what it does and I'll just add

I think that's that's the science fiction association of what CRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists\nOf gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise]\nBut we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong\nBones or leader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their gee you know [noise]\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient a painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits do inherit from their parents something we can already do with Avi A. F. N. genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever need\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting\nEditing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think\nThere are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the richest HIV immunity genes your five that's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning but\nI mean I mean a part of me wonders\nSweeping giving that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of have sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up ending that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course where we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think\nYou have this very radio issue of directing future evolution you know\nEven saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it in embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher out you\nWere being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] hamster and Barry is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the I think of all power to control evolution you can check out his ... at ... dot com\n[noise]\nHow can they show we're asking a very important question is who are we [noise]\nOkay do you have the answer deem know who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] I have a a a an inkling of who we are this is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature [noise]\nBut certainly there are methods of say cognitive behavior therapy that are probably effective at reducing anxiety and phobias and treating depression yeah uh\nAnd the thing is that that those don't appeal to a some if serial immaterial soul they uh are ways of acting on our neural circuitry\nWe kept to keep in mind that are neural circuitry is so intricate complex and has been shaped by evolution to interact with the world through our social ah\nMechanisms of of interacting to language to facial expression their body language that there are ways of of changing our feelings and thoughts by the old fashioned route of conversation and example and uh and and art and of evidence based cycle therapy\nSo there is the scope for for a range of behavior within the Angelo given personality type and we can probe the outside of the ... the genes make available to us [noise]\nDo you when you think about what what and an eight person do you think that it can be figured out pretty logically or do you think that huge parts of it or just mysterious\nHuge parts of it are are certainly mysterious because we interactions are so unfathomable a complex yeah there are tend to a hundred billion cells in the brain connected by a hundred trillion synopsis and no one can keep track of all of them even in a computer simulation\nWe also know that chance plays an enormous role above and beyond the role of either genes or\nEnvironments or we can see this in identical twins who are brought up together and not not the exotic cases of twin separated at birth but just the kind of twins that all of us know\nIf you notice a pair of twins you know that they're they're they're they're more similar to two people plucked off the street at random\nBut they're unique individuals out there that you won't you don't confuse them once you know and sometimes they're not friends and sometimes they're not friends are indeed a now how do you account for those differences it's not fair ... at least not the ones they inherited from their parents there could be some uh a few mutations that each one or idiosyncratic required\nA it's not there by and large their environments because they grew up and do the same parents the same school the same house the same older subs framed younger sibs [noise]\nReally forced to the conclusion that uh there's an enormous role for a for a chance for the role of the dice in a who have become because ah [noise]\nTo people who have everything in common both the genes and the environmental level

staples and from the listeners to support this NPR station\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and to on the show ideas about food a connection to it and its power to change so much\nAbout the way we live [noise] I just buy a bottle of water and on the label is head gluten free interest [laughter]\nWell and it is [laughter] this is food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat have become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government's through direct and indirect subsidies encourage the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop in endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes it was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown and now I Am most just in Iowa and again you can't believe the drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nWe got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself I wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either some of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well\nMeanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses if women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the various stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and like what you were saying earlier ally that has to do with with the fact that like one day we ship food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this can go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want a tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything that you you are a guy that a lot of people are gonna let you and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of ... Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the basics vegan before six and a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinnertime and then do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know or the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because I had her broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's your only choice [noise]\n\nSomething given a choice what do we do ultimately we have to figure out how the food industry can still make money selling real food\nThe answers can absolutely they can but not with the current business model the food industry grosses one trillion dollars a year in the United states of that for ...\nFifty billion of it is gross profit now health care costs in America total to point seven trillion dollars a year of which Seventy five percent is chronic metabolic disease of which Seventy five percent of that could be preventable if we would do something about our diet\nThat's one point four trillion dollars\nTriple what the food industry makes we spend triple cleaning up the food industry's mess than they actually make the bottom line is they're going to drive this bus till the wheels fall off the only answer is\nReal food we just have to figure out how to make it available and profitable for everyone\nAt that weight I'm assuming the sugar industry really hate you sure yeah they intend words\nOr less yeah they they love me yeah that's the way this works my job is to provide the science so that the public to make its own informed decision\nAnd then but not many people are saying what you're saying I mean you know look\nA lot of noise in the system for obvious reasons you've got all of these this ... of people with their own vested interests I have no vested interest other than taking care of children and seeing children\nGet to adulthood to have a decent chance in life that's my vested interests and to be honest with you it ought to be everybody's vested interest [noise]\nSo are you just like totally anti sugar or do you like do you in college yeah just just a little bit\nOf course now and again the problem is\nI'm for dessert\nFor dessert right but if you're going to have breakfast cereal with orange juice and take a priest son and\nA granola bar and that's all before three o'clock you know then you've got a problem [noise]\nMore\nOr less take is a professor at the University of California in San Francisco you can see his entire talk at Ted got NPR dot org were back in just a minute stay with us on the show today ideas about how we connect to food I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to the Ted radio hour\nFrom NPR is one city age and this is WABC way ATM ... thanks suspending probably be a weekend with us everyone who's votes WIP this weekend is being entered into a drawing to win a one thousand dollar apple gift card that's kind of see of leap frog\nPeacemaker donation now online uh WABC dot org ... six seven eight to five five three Nineteen Ninety [noise]\nSupport for WABC comes from Atlanta history center presenting the C.

[noise]\nSometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel show that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas to crunch us a freshness or these other groups that\nCharles says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might call a white wine artificially rhetoric with an odorless tasteless food dye\nAnd they've done appropriately you'll find the experts the wind make says we'll get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think because of red wine all the ... the tobacco and the dark chocolates and the fruits and so I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles stats on the stage\nAhead this morning to tell you about the perfect meal world convinced we can taste the food we enjoy the flavors ... of the wind in the blast\nBut if I look at what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study how to measure is I'm a tendency among the scientists that when you're a guest strong as it's just think people like your eye a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink see which parts of the brain ... this is that it's going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy\nIs one problem here which is that in fact in the matter is that one of these brain scan is kind of lie on your back where they had ... with a true when you're married\nThat periodically square sin ah some drink you call what led to be full of your head all kind of a jolt and that will spoil that the brain scan alignment but it's kind of tells you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal in one of those situations [noise]\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\nI was actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be with some very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nUh I Know one of the perfect meal when they're fighting with up hot in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in the end and you can never quite capture when you get back home he says you're moods you pretty relax your holiday less stressed Tripoli with their family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were\nThinking that phenomenon has a name that we've all learned bushes which I'm from the province all rose a paradox ... that's it used to describe a northern Europeans um but to Italy who gave for that's all holidays to the Mediterranean\nUh nothing some well or on the side of the sea sipping not Rosie wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... they can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all out and not tasteless either pass by someone you've ever had\nSo great that you want to buy a Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you have in that you bring it back\nAnd then you just wanted [noise] your friends are like this is really cheap ... yeah I understand what happened\nSomething about when the bottles when they're playing with a cold and not you know sport the wind things not about a tool we never eat no drink no we're always somewhere\nIn a certain environments and certain states of mind\nOn all mental state and the environment both together kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy it and we saw in a way to miss attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise]\n... pleasure into what we think about food\n[noise] in fact just Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that

[noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons baking is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain how\nThat works so a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so\nExample in the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights\n[noise] [noise] [noise] even why these recent changes as a positive step toward broadening the definition of legal person all to include animals because he's been dedicated to for nearly ... years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer ... now\nI read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I had become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defense list and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless billions of non human animals\nAre and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals as ... I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them has also become legal persons now at that time there was very little\nKnown about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on when I knew it was going to take a long time\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially [noise] [noise] changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my ... and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the one critical legal movement is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London\nHundreds of experiments worldwide with this actually\nHappens happens while the Ireland is the most recent country to have randomly selected nonchalant people to talk about the constitutional ban on abortion to talk about how they can tackle climate change to talk about other things I fix them parliament's\nThese Ninety nine randomly selected sample of people went through weekends of deliberation informed by X\nIt's with public input into that process and they came up with the proposal supported by around two thirds of them to abolish this constitutional ban on abortion which was then put to a referendum on about two thirds the Irish people agreed with them if these people are so good at is why do we still need politicians\nHave to be honest that idea scares me I don't want the first hundred people on the phone book running the country I Want people who are steeped in policy who understand the nuances of how laws get made Abu understand the consequences like that's what I Want\nSo how does a random democracy you know solve this problem elections\nDon't produce experts this is a complete jealousy otherwise we would elect our brain surgeons um yeah elections produce people who are good at winning elections\nAnd to be good at winning election you need a massive war chest of money you need to be charismatic you need to be out to\nInspire people with ... tweets I don't I'm not sure but it doesn't mean that you're good at making policy making so I Would actually argue that's a random representative sample with good persists informed by experts who've costs or don't have power they just have the power to give information um\nWould result in better policy of course you would potentially need these people to go through the induction process where they learn about how the system guys will how low making is made except for\nThe other option that we hand over the running of our country to a group of experts is exactly what author returned regimes argue China\nIn theory is run by groups of ex threats so yeah I think it's it's a you open yourself up to the accusations of authoritarianism if you say I think we should actually handed over to a tech not proceed you'll suddenly\nWell that's the thing like let me see if I understand correctly\nIn a system that you think would be a better system more representative essentially you would eliminate the lectures yes right you get rid of people voting for elected officials you get rid of that and you would have some kind of system a lottery ... a lottery whatever it is where people are randomly selected from the population\nAnd they get a letter in the mail and they say hey you know you're going to be represented for the next two years and that's\n[noise] that's how you would you do do a there's a lot of pros and questions around there but the key thing is that it works when people do this people make trusted balance decisions and I I I think it would lead to a massive increase interest in the in the governmental system and the decisions that are my [noise]\nAnd we come back and just a moment red headache describes how he envisions randomly selecting leaders on the show today hacking the law I'm Guy rise and you're listening to the Ted radio hour from NPR\nIt's one said hey good afternoon I'm much access and this is W.

health\nIt's that\nRadio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raz and on the show today ideas about hacking the law and we were just hearing\nBrett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I I Would make a voluntary once you've sent out\nTen thousand lettuce to random section of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who were still interest in that you do a second random selection of those interests of making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so making sure you had gender bounce you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better for my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea\nThat actually you need diversity bounce ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John how some people\nI'm not saying I'm Sorry a contract has got to the galaxy guy out Douglas Adams ducked with us it's just I just got my dog of Adam's saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand up for two years is that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nAnd in fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a comment in the world to instigate a one elected chamber in one solution chamber once with ... and buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of\nPoliticians busy back stabbing each other and engaging the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for his chamber uh this is a path to old is the ideal\nSelection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute the pollen and tried to society of friends I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people\nIf you don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... his recycling box\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these mountain examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nRealistically if I can really spread out on a global scale in your lifetime [noise]\nYeah we have out strategy or and that is yet to to get the ... assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds\nTo a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the ...\nMaybe other people who take notice maybe ... spreads I could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with a second buddies flickered basalt dish and that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle is to try and convince people and then entrenched powers to um to try this\nYes uh yeah it ... it 'em ups are those things will be easy to political changes ... seats are especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to own a unified on to try something new I seek help system's broken and unknown to see a change [noise]", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "13", "locations": [["South Africa", -29.0, 24.0],
