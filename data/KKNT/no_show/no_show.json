spoke to penguins in the Antarctic a Mitt to subject happiness and ethical monotheism\nAnd they ah they were equally interested in both there was one thing when the hundred or so looking at me the

guess you're a member\nThere birds there at Quantico birds I guess why every body and this is the happiness our today's subject I admit at the outset so here is a trigger a warning we need you know what we need a musical\nOr some sound effects [noise] it's not a dog whistle it's a trigger now there's not a dog was all this is a trigger for the sensitive\nSo that they will know that they may be challenged or even a God Forbid really God Forbid offended\nThat how that works\nSo here it is every body and\nWhat made me think of this topic was actually the last hour the previous hour talking about nationalism so I have a theory and you've probably heard we say\nAbout ... thousand or so times 'cause I have a lot of\nTheories about life ... theory that identities are important to happiness\n\nWith me and I'm thinking of three and there may be more and if you have more or if you defer certainly if you defer one aide Prager seven seven six but first hear what the identities are\nAnd they are in no uh in order of importance just three identities that I think are they are necessary or they are major additives to one's happiness\nBut they are not sufficient if this is this a loan doesn't make you happy but they are great\nAdditives supplements contribute towards that is the word they're great contribute tours\nTo one's happiness a sexual identity male or female a national identity and the religious identity [noise]\nI think in my lifetime I have seen that these things are real contributors now the reason I warn you at the outset the trigger is that there are those am I won't even identify them 'cause it's a happiness our on everybody to listen and everybody would be as comfortable as possible\nBut there are those who are working to\nNotify those identities and say that they they really are not real and they are not even good\nBut that and therefore I truly truly believe they are contributing to unhappiness in the population by knocking these identities\nWon a Prager seven seven six so that I Believe that the more comfortable you are with being a woman or being a man being a boy or being a girl\nAnd that is that is a serious part of your identity sir I Will be totally or buy a graphic here I have always been I'm very lucky I admit it always been comfortable with being mail\nI've never wanted to be a female I've never thought of myself as female I Am truly comfortable and I celebrate ... to ... to whatever extent that his celebrate a boy I Am I my male identity and I want females to do the exact same thing with being female\nI think I mean I I don't know how you can debate that that is a contributor to happiness nobody would argue even the most I Would think\nOf the most ardent defender of the transgendered and I'm not even attacking the trench I live on the contrary you is not an attack at all but I I Would say that nobody would argue that having gender this for you thinking that you are the other sex\nOr bend your biological given sex is not an it's not a source of happiness if it may be something that you you you have to deal with and of course it's something you have to deal with\nAnd you should try still to maximize your opportunities for happiness in life but it's you gotta really my reality to argue that that is\nA a not an obstacle at the very least to one's happiness\nWe're one is not comfortable being a male or being a female so that's one identity I identity is in fact almost been given a bad name oh he has an identity ooh that's not that's not good next is a national identity\nI think it contributes to one's happiness to feel part of something larger\nAnd ... and I think I think it's terrific I feel very American it has been a major contribution contributor to my happiness and I uh I celebrate it\nDoesn't mean I think America can do no wrong with some sort of serenity it's like saying I don't think men can do any wrong celebrating the fact that I Am a man\nOr or comfortable with the fact that I'm a man but having an identity more the more I identify as this is my thesis of this happiness our the more you identify with\nThe the greater your chance for happiness in third as your religious identity that is played a major role in my life in my case Judaism being Jewish\nAnd it is for Christians obviously there are the majority great majority of you listening obviously you're not Jewish but it doesn't matter or whatever it might be if you're more men if you're if you're Catholic if your Protestant that fewer evangelical\nOr whatever it might be what every ... ... ... it can contribute to your happiness sometimes it contributes to misery all of them can all of them can also contribute to your misery\n... nothing is a guarantee in life\nYou can be a you could be at war with your with your religious identity some people are\n\nWhen I first started radio I was the moderator of a program on ABC in Los Angeles very very very popular show I inherited a very popular show my bragging\nI was the moderator and as a priest a rabbi minister each week different ones each week and then there were members of fourth religions\nAnd I\nWould get calls people call him and I remember how many people called and it was amazing to me that is so much so that one time there were so many people who identify themselves to tell you Hi Venice so I just want to say to the pre Selma next Catholic or I'm a recovering Catholic\nAnd I I I I was amazed I was amazed at how many people still identify themselves egg nobody called ... say you know I'm an ex Protestant I'm an ex Jew [laughter]\nSo ... we had this this I these people were obviously at war with their identity one guy called any was Ninety\nAnd he was still angry at the nuns who would apparently raptors ... with a ruler when he was when he was twelve I might tell them you know I Am and I'm not Catholic but it seems to me after Seventy eight years you might want to give that up [noise]\nI think they can move towards shrunk slightly isolated especially in the Democratic right now I live in New York I live in New York ... and and now you have it so I feel but I feel strongly about the environment\nProbably out of your children feel\nWell I have one boy and he's actually the thing and then found out and he's he's good [laughter] he he's\nAlso ... who do you have who do you have these conflicts with\nA more of a trend more like an online find your extended family in\nWell look I I hear you I don't want to talk too much politics on the happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality or what what she says it's true\nSuzy who wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it I mean while there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find kindred spirits otherwise you'd be very lonely it would be\nBut if it's a challenge to find kindred spirits to that in New York City isn't it interesting I mean of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she said she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics\nBut interesting very interesting defining element in the ideological rift in America thank you Susan I appreciate that uh Eddie in Chicago hello ed Dennis Prager\n... thank you for taking my call a long time listener I Am driving with my son who is Eighteen years old who is away at college and

listen\nWe're you know we're both here to study and we're both students and or you know we're good guys and so on and so what I like to do just say what I like to do is I like to figure out where it

science\nOr I Diane I have learned from the ah John I asked job to call back from Illinois and from the first hour because he doesn't agree with me you can go on\nOkay yeah I Hope I Hope we hope I can express myself and we don't interrupt each other and call to yell at you or anything\nLike no no I Know that I only interrupted you because you\nMade a point that was so dishonest and I'm not saying you did it deliberately that I had to stop you because otherwise I Would have let it go you compared antifa to the Nazis of the past instead of the Nazi use of the president\n... ... is the most violent group in America today\nIt's not the most violent group in the world in history go ahead\nOkay well maybe we can touch on that as well but uh I I look at a series of events that I reach a conclusion I Know you reach a different conclusion but here's here's what I'm saying and I want to know what you think\nAh in May of last year a racist to pledge to support that Donald Trump and adjust to just attended a a big a right wing rally murder two men on a commuter train when he was\nConfronted him when he was a cop in Muslim women then in August of last year\nA self identified neo Nazi also a Trump supporter in Charlottesville, Virginia killed a resident of Charlottesville, Virginia Heather Heyer she was not a member ... she was part of the majority of people opposing the neo Nazis who were simply residents of that town or students or parts of religious groups that are coming to stand up to the organized racist\nOr I see the president celebrating and endorsing violence against or journalistic Montana I listen to his antagonistic rhetoric towards his enemies and now we have what appears to be a right wing supporter of the presidents president engaging in a massive assassination effort against\nThose anti antagonistic or critics of the president\nAnd I hear you say that ... is the biggest\n... and the liberal ... no no I don't know the economy at all and\nI said the ... say the left is I it then the first part of the left\nI'll probably tell you okay I heard what you said now can I respond or do you want more say more\nIf I can just finished my thought I was gonna say I also hear it and while this bar the bombings were going on I heard a lot of people in your line of work\nI'm Sorry while these bombings what bombing in yeah sorry if so what what bombings the the all the mail bombs that twelve okay you know they're not bombing you have to be precise John nothing bombed okay obviously we are so they weren't no bombings the ... statement bombings okay\nI'm Sorry if I start something that confusing you didn't\nKnow and I don't know no no no you're dishonesty ... I'm Sorry to say this or you didn't confused me\nYou live there were no bombings John there were no bottom is that accurate or inaccurate did you confused me or were you an accurate answer me a boy and confused me or were you an accurate drink Don I didn't filibuster\nYou spoke the whole time you're already made ... nobody laughs at me by by Okay John ... a John as dishonest and it's painful for me to say I asked them to come on again I gave them plenty of time there were no bombings and then he said he confused me\nCan you play with language my friend the left is a far greater threats of violence in this country there were a right wing despicable human beings who do despicable things there were a left wing despicable human beings\nBut let me let me show every one of my friends I Will be speaking at Colorado State university next week I Will need or I won't leave security no leftist needs a security at a at a university that's a far larger issue than one crock pot here or one crock pot there\nNobody has a monopoly on crackpots book the left has a far greater dominance of violence of shutting of people they don't agree with\nIt is extremely difficult to enter a campus with a conservative thought is effortless to enter with a left the store I don't know what country this man lives in but it is it the same as the one I Do okay and\nLet's go to Alex in South gate California Hi Alice Dennis Prager\nI gotta thank you for taking my call thank you and I want to thank you for being a good moral um subject in my life I've been looking for thirty six years I started listening to you and we're going to get on the line with what has been shown\nThat it's not you so you started in your twenties in your twenties [laughter] yeah I Know I\nStarted at my team [laughter] I mean that's well about is that right sooner sixteen Seventeen years old when he well feeling Glendale hoping to meet you about where your neighbor got day\nWell vats clinical you go on\nWell and and particularly when either one or both of the parents remarry and you're bringing in a one or two more\nYears old at all writing\nAs parental units I think it's extremely important and in my own divorced\nThat was a not the case he was not a what we call a good divorce if there is such a thing and it did have some major impact upon our children are they're saying there are mistakes that I made certainly\nThere were things I was not aware of but I think you're absolutely correct on that on that issue it doesn't alleviate everything but it does go a long long ways to help them deal with what is\nNothing but a I mean almost all the time a bad situation for the kids there are certainly exceptions\nYeah we don't they'll work no no obviously hot listen yeah you're very thoughtful man and I appreciate it\nBut I think we're in substantial agreement look life is filled\nWith obstacles to happiness and filled with landmines and that is how we navigate our life that ultimately determines or ability to handle that hopefully and with some degree of happiness\nI\nHave a lot of a lot of lot of thoughts on divorce and I should I haven't talked about in quite some time I've talked about a much more in the past and I will address again thanks to this call\nBut he and I both agree that the issue is what you do after the divorce more than the divorce I mean many things are factors including what age you you divorced what trial the child's age\nIt's it's very different if the child was too that if the trial was twelve or the trial was twenty two\n\nThat's that's it it is he says no comparison in fact\nBut\nBut the the most calamitous results by obscene or when a parent the parent the parent ... the other parent de legitimize as the other most children are attached to both parents\nAnd even if you are right\nCertain you're right the legitimize of the other parents in an old but the most most egregious cases is a sin against\nAgainst the child against your family or how are you doing there yeah All right I won't I won't take a call because we're going to take a break in the moment\nI think that\nPeople just need to understand very few lives are smoothed including kids from intact parents how many people are at the psychiatrists and psychologists parents never divorced\nThat's not to say that all things being equal that's the ideal of course it to be

Americans and how wrong it is so you know this is this is I and I noticed you backed off of these old my kid wants to play plans because he loved loved prince\nBut you're not going to want to put black shoe polish on his face or black makeup to dark and his skin because you know how offensive that is\nAnd that sort of that racial short of reality you could say it's a double standard but it is after all the reality I let me take you to a Jew or in the NYPD\nRight now breaking now on the Mike Gallagher show\nThis is the deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism of the NYPD in midtown Manhattan holding a press conference a briefing about the latest uh intelligence gathering and the investigation of these suspicious a mail bombs that have been sent now or that have been sent in the mail here here we go to New York city\n[noise] ah that whole sole worker was able to notify the u._s. postal police on scene hair\nContacted the joint terrorism task force of analyzing the\nThis area was secured while emergency service\nMan why ... responded\nBack it was isolated [noise]\nUh and the post office\nWas able to do their equipment to conduct an X ray\nThey saw what appears to be a pipe bomb\nConsistent with other devices what you're saying that we\nPainted a package consistent with the fact that we've seen this week\nWas addressed to that end of April [noise]\nI'm at a location in Manhattan\nWhere I was able to safely removed that packet\nOf ice and\nEnter the containment vessel\nAnd transport that highway outsource to\nAnalyze the range Rodman snack where it'll be biased in a secure storage area for the FBI who will then transported along with the other suspect the device was seen as we\nWe I live\nWith me I have\nA little bit from John Miller with the NYPD there should be transporting this and there was video of the one of those big trucks with the containment facility so that nobody could get hurt let's pray that whoever this\nCo producers caught quickly\nWe know you're not always going to\nTo morning are advertisers mind being from\nCleveland media\nYou're on ... studios I Am familiar with as\nUsually my son's riding in the last ... hours a week with a Hillsdale dialogue\nStarting the week with a Hillsdale dialogue and Dr\nLarry earned because we're eight days from a crucial election and we are on the other side of a terrible massacre in Pittsburgh and the range bomber in Florida and the incendiary rhetoric across the spectrum\nAnd I thought some history would be used for your documentary on good morning and thank you for doing a double dip this week\nA good morning how are you\nI'm good I I Want to begin by asking you to put a what the no nothing movement in context is because last night I saw a lot of people on line saying that Donald Trump is leading the modern no nothing's\nWhich is simply not historically correct and I knew I could turn to you for similar to a new ... were\nA well so nineteenth century political movement or they didn't they thought that uh Jews and Catholics and\nAnd they're they're especially focused on them\nAnd you know I don't know why anybody would be ... million Jews but Catholics now that I Would say that we have to have to deprive ourselves of the of our sense of humor in these days but um\nThey they ah you know let Lincoln a lot of them voted for Lincoln a Lincoln denounce them\nAnd what they thought was that uh it was a Protestant country of white country and that it would be better if it remains so\nAnd they and that you know they were spread around the country quite widely they never had a huge percentage of the vote and they were important because you know and in fact there isn't anybody quite like that important enough to to make a difference today that I Know of but they were important because politics for very narrowly drawn for\nFifteen or Twenty years divided on the slavery question but then ancillary matters\nThat could get four or five or two or three percent of the vote could change things a lot so they were important in American politics\nAnd they were ah they were not a passing phase they'd never really gone away the idea of nativism in the eye that white Protestant on the country\nBut neither have they ever been very powerful and I do not believe they make up much or even an infant decimal percentage of the Trump coalition I don't believe I asked Secretary Clinton when she was on the show last year do you believe there's more than a half\nMillion white nationalist in the United states and she agreed with me that there isn't and and that we're mixing up two hundred and thirty million people\nI just don't believe it is that many people do one of them can do are ripping slaughter as was done Saturday in Pittsburgh we ought not to overestimate because by doing so we encourage the rest of the nation of their hatred\nA trade and ah you know I and not only do I do not believe that they're very many people like that I don't believe they're very many people who believe that they're very many people like that in fact many of the people who say that there are a lot of people like that I don't believe they believe it I think it's a political tool\nYes and explain why\nBy the way I think it's going to burn their hand for picking up this tool a and specifically I talk this morning\nAbout uh the network to which I contribute MSNBC is running high rise to lower third so little the words at the bottom of the of the screen I Want to read to a couple of them Trump's role in stoking violence among Americans how Trump such the tone for anti Semite\nYou see they have picked up this this white hot slander and I don't think an insurance to president I think it burns to people who employer what do you think\nWell so this is a really great Holleman Jenkins ... column on the wall Street Journal I read it this morning it might have been for the last week um and he makes the point that that a\n... you know everybody except for tiny sliver of the population or all of whom are probably watching MSNBC who knows\nUm think that there's just way too much of this stuff right that that this politically correct talk\nOr this you know Megan Kelly him I have never liked by the way\nBut she got fired and if she just left off one expression what she said was entirely objectionable and somebody at Netflix to write and sell their chords that go after but horse how big are the whores right and I and as you say in a country of three hundred million plus\nHow big are these hordes and the answer is not very big\nBecause most people don't think I mean if you just walk about in society and look\nYou will see the evidence of the fact that the society is organized around the principle of human equality and what human equality means of is a person treated like a person treat the same person like a person\nSo you just see in society today and it it wasn't always true with black people by the way which is a blight on our history but you but it is true today just look and see\nAnd then you know ... if you think it's always been a racist country go study the Eighteen fifty eight election for the Senate in ... Illinois where Abraham Lincoln won the popular vote on the claim\nThat the black woman may not be are equal in all respects but in her right to eat the bread that she earns with the split of her own face she is the equal of every person on earth and I I Want\nArgue audience where you've added to affiliates today a documentary on who have not heard you before and therefore will take some getting used to we have to not have been considered\nA news radio fourteen WTO being Dover, Delaware and radio news radio fourteen fifty W. I. L. M. in Wilmington, Delaware so they will not do our was one of the states that Lincoln had to worry about keeping in the union right donor was was a slave holding state\nHim at the time in the civil war and Lincoln had to work very hard\nAs he said I Hope that God on my side but I must have Kentucky he he needed the states and so he acted as a political person with regards to everyone in there but those sorts of politics\nThat sort of new one is lost in cable land I mean it just it's all your evil or you're not evil and by the way it's not just on the left is on the right as well and I think it's destroying politics\nI don't so I think that's right and and you know there was a lot of extremism in America in the Eighteen fifty goodness sakes you know there were plots to kill Lincoln and one of them succeeded finally [noise]\nBut but it's also true though that those debates between Lincoln and Douglas or very worth reading\nAnd then if you read them fairly in my in my argument if you read them fairly you will see the the inspiring man one and the man who spoke for the meaning of America One and it's just a remarkable event in human history because\nThey would get twenty thousand people out in the sun sitting for four hours to watch those debates\nAnd and that means that in America there is this you know basic way that we get along as Americans and it's the principle that everyone who demeans himself as a good citizen quote George Washington\nHas the rights of a citizen and must all and and that means that the bias is there's a bias\nThe bias is when you encounter somebody on the street tree in like a human being\nA man who spoke for the meaning of America One I think that is so ... would you explain what that means\nWell the you know and so you know all political history by the way has tragedy in it or there's even an argument that it always ends in tragedy a tragedy if they're very many remembering that it's the most glorious political story at least in modern times\nAnd the tragedy is that for the first time we found it a country according to the principle that all men are created equal\nAnd buy all men they meant women too and and then we had savory among us and been here for a long time thought here under British Rule and so what do we do about that and in the founding there's a consensus that it's a really bad thing\nSomething's got to be done about that eventually and in more than sixty percent of the union it was quickly abolished\nA but then new ideas took wrote in this road and this is where the tragedy is in my opinion these new ideas said that nowhere evolutionary figures\nAnd we evolved to be different kinds of things and by the way if you look at the thought of modern liberalism radical modern left wing liberal is some you will see lots of thinking just like this fight we talked about genes all the time now [noise]\nSo uh it's like it's like somehow your genes control your behavior which means the human soul is not free anyway that gets going and by Eighteen twenty that's a major force in America\nAnd then what are you going to do about it right and then the and what we did about it was we fought our worst war over the question is the human being a product of his heritage or is it a free soul created by God\nAnd you know it's just another great fact\nThat about the United states of America that George Washington and Seventeen Ninety eight brought to the Hebrew congregation in Newport Rhode Island\nThat it is now no more that we speak of religious toleration or by the intelligence of some that others enjoy their inherent natural rights and that is probably the first letter written by chief executive of any country except ancient Israel to some Jews addressing them as equal citizens\nThat the American heritage and there's no reason to believe that Kevin McCarthy does not does not feel the weight and greatness of that just like everybody who knows this story and that and it's an American does\nExactly and on left and right except for these crazed neo Nazis who are an evil and we're talking about that even when we come back [noise] let me also encourage you during the

appropriate not to blame Donald Trump for this job\nAnd there are people on both sides who say crazy stuff and do crazy stuff and ... say stuff that should be withdrawn and has an inappropriate\nBut for goodness sake what one of the things that congressman Jackie Speier said today and she said uh it's the same thing it's the same thing here one comes after the other as President Trump explodes verbal bombs and uh and his opponents\nAnd then uh this bomb or say op\nHe uh he builds real bombs to explode at his opponents can we get something very very clear here there's a difference between verbal bombs\nAnd real bombs you remember that uh that old child and union yeah a sticks and stones will break your bones but names will never hurt you I'm a yeah\nThat's that's true when it comes to physical pain and there's there's generally unless you're calling from violence against somebody which by the way this individual says are say I may have done\nWhen you're calling for physical violence against somebody that can be a crime\nBut if you're just saying someone is a loser it's fake news or someone who's dishonest or if someone is such a disgrace okay it may not be nice\nNot the right thing to do to use your ability of your right of free speech for that\nPurpose but it's not criminal harming people exploding bombs at people that's that's criminal obviously one\nEight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number or let's go to your calls and to Dee in Pittsburgh D. or on the Michael Mann that show\nThat I'm tired of hearing that from the old man\n... had an inch somebody in of hay and he ... the there is he going to be honest you know where that happened I so I I remember during the campaign he went home whatever he's from withholding already far his followers and a bunch of that state's mall came into the stadium\nAnd throwing it some thought to speak yeah Russia to that point and I'm sure I'll show you could not speak\nI Need to then get them out of here for one God grab one of them and what side for him off another one of them a punch one of ... for for border I plan on fat on ... ... ...\nYou're not sure I'm I'm not sure that your narrative D is exactly the way it happened but you're right there was a situation in California\nWhere there are a bunch of Trump supporters outside of the stadium where he was speaking who were assaulted by demonstrators on the other side and yes this is stupid and there was an attempt I went and culture was supposed to be speaking at University of California\nAre they actually did property damage and they riot it and are there is no question that the left has been far more guilty of actual violence\nTrying to shut down free speech then their rights far more guilty of it I've never heard of a case in the last stove fifty years of people on the right shutting down any speaker at a college campus\nHappens all the time from the left appreciate your call or let's go quickly to John in Olympia, Washington John you're on the ...\nYou know it is telling how how you're acting right now because if it had been a as a democratic order Dole\nTalking heads I Would be this as a a false flag and and you mentioned earlier in my mind as you mentioned earlier that Trump spoke and he said he didn't want violent and terror effect to take root in America\nTrump is reaping what he so he he he is doing nothing but a a that this guy was a a a Trump supporter not far right weight\nAnd it needs to be excluding like that Mike and you should be way at first and foremost thing but it will hold on hold on for a moment ...\n... again you're not saying things that are untrue but you're saying things that are disconnected in other words it as Trump's slogan irresponsibly in the past from time to time he does but ... there is no connection\nAnd at no point to Trump's ... anything like a I Hope these people die and do you remember what what part of what this reminds me of and I'll I'll tell you I'm reminded of it\nIs this guy on his van had sites are put on showing a a um a target from a crosshairs from a gun the sites on the faces of people he dislikes Michael Moore and Van Jones and Hillary Clinton\nAnd you remember when Gabby Giffords was shot and she ended up being shot by somebody was on the left who was pro marijuana legalization is basically and not but he was on the left\nAnd um and and people try to associate that with Sarah Palin\nWho said that there are certain congressional seats that we should target to pick up and they had put a that none of our picture of Gabby Giffords but over a a map that showed her congressional seat that's just stretching it and and trying to criminalize opposition [noise] which I think his poisonous we'll be right back [noise]\nWhy your old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the victims of illegal immigration American lives destroyed by our broken immigration laws\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nKevin McCarthy is real cool hand in for so long that fully funds President Trump's border wall expands caseload penalizing them an illegal immigrants and insurers only of American citizens have the right move over to\nConservative solution of America deserves\nThe leadership of President Trump's\nBuild a wall didn't force the law\nRather than Trump visited time for the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy is ... ball and enforce the law\nPay for my safety for the express [noise]\nTo live or a very important message about this radio station in my sixties a patriot by shooting spree or you've\nHeard me talk about the American trinity for some of them in God we trust liberty the three things go set the United states for some horrible idea that as a news radio station is a place for ... years principles fries every day you never forget the faith and freedom of part of what our country's\nSection there were some people would find ways to

this is what our radio stations all about as long as you're there to listen to us we'll be here for you you still you know friends of mine\nActually sell our sponsors you appreciate their support\nThe radio station and tell us your thought nine sixty patriotic [noise]\nI'm a firefighter training I'm a former I'm a barber shop on mom\nWe're all part of the community every day we live in and out of

moments and take a monsoon\nCaffeine something that's\nIt's not about paranoia more be unafraid\nStanding out there protecting our community one detail more out of time because a lot of detail and can become an arena we we trust I think just like you should because only you know we're not supposed to be in your every dang\nSurf protector every day\nThe from the local assigning\n\nWhy do you have the greatest show on the planet\nAnd on the Michael ... show I've referred a couple of times on this show to um [noise] things that President Trump has tweeted that [noise] that I think are not constructive uh this is a tweet from a couple of days ago before they solve this a crime\nThe series of crimes actually President Trump tweeted a very big part of the anger anger capitalized we see today in our society has caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting\nOf the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description\n\nOn many says mainstream media must clean up its act fast and fast all capitalized with an exclamation point\nUm [noise]\nWhat's my big problem there were just one word which is purposeful purposely false\nAmerican culture is so much on the show\nAnother very day in his greatest nation on God's green earth and it's always a great day when you can come into a weekend with great news to celebrate and it is great news for America is great news for\nRepublicans for Democrats for independence for people who don't care about politics at all\nThe perpetrator of that horrible bomb scare with fourteen different explosive devices mailed around the country\nAlleged perpetrator has been apprehended and he has been interrogated the proof is accumulating\nAnd the prospect does he will be going away for some forty years but meanwhile the president of the United states charged as\nEarlier today and I think in an appropriate and dignified way with the necessity of people actually coming together and transcending some of the bitterness and viciousness of our politics recently\nAnd I want to speak to you for a few moments or with a a friend and somebody who I I'm view as a very significant ally\nFor constitutional causes his name is Michael Ferris he is the president the c._e._o. and general counsel of the alliance defending freedom and uh and and Mike we were just talking off the air for a moment\nOr I think we agree then one of the essential elements of trying to\nTo reduce the levels of polarization and hostility and viciousness and meanness and craziness that has afflicted American politics\nIs to affirm freedom of speech and freedom of conscience freedom of faith and that's exactly what the alliance defending freedom as about we agree with that proposition what'd you\nSure the the historical American position has been I may disagree with everything you say it all depends on the right to say it\nAnd we're losing that left in particular [noise] although there are some of the right to take this position but the left with the levers of power like jak Philips case where they tried to shut down it crushes Baker who didn't want to use his creative skills to speak a message in favor of same sex weddings\nAnd and the California case that we did in the spring were last year or California to force pro life centers to give a pro abortion message [noise] people aren't willing to let people have their own opinions and say that freely they ... at you know\nCan we go to the California case for a moment because all of that very closely and it was extraordinary an extraordinary victory which seems to mean for the alliance defending freedom\nOr this one is I I've spoken several times for fundraising banquets for um for crisis pregnancy centers and would crisis pregnancy centers tried to do is to give people an alternative\nIn a crisis pregnancy is where a very often people are and marry they have no funds\nThat rather than terminate the pregnancy getting an abortion\nOr that the centers will help you ... the bear the child raising a child and and deal with all the challenges in ... and they were being forced by legislation in California to put up signs that said if you want abortion services [laughter]\nGo go to this address go here do there um and that's about right isn't\n[noise] yes um I argued the case in the Supreme Court myself and you got it exactly right California's real they were asked to in their papers passing a law that this is a part of the progressive issues to ensure that the correct pro abortion message was given everywhere I'm\nIncluding these charitable private crisis pregnancy centers that were set up by donations from people who are pro life\nYeah exactly and so the they were not willing to let people have a different opinion on abortion if if if you were on\nOur side of the issue of the other side of course I wasn't required the ... the Planned Parenthood has not affected by this law it was only they claim that they only wanted all women to have all the news well didn't work that way\nRight and and be just to get this so people see it so clearly in other words you would have been fine with is is that a Planned Parenthood day and said well if you want an alternative to abortion and then go to a crisis pregnancy center\nIn equal actually I Would have ... I Would take the position that Planned Parenthood shouldn't be forced to give our message and we shouldn't be forced to give the pro abortion message\nBut then the lack of a quality shows what the real problem here is is that people want to silence\nViewpoint that they don't agree with and I think that that's that's where the lack of civility is really coming in and it's we're saying that the other people don't even have a valid point of view I mean we can there's a difference between saying\nI'm you know your time to express your view and saying I agree with your view and you know it's it's okay to disagree in this country but to some people are not allowed to disagree anymore and they will silence you if you disagree with the progressive viewpoint\nWhat uh what is the story going on right now with Blaine Adams and who is the ... does emotional T shirts a case\nCases pending in the Kentucky Supreme Court [noise] um the local officials there went after him because he wouldn't print T shirts with the gay pride to them\nAnd he will print teachers for any person but he won't go overall message is there's other messages eastern down over the years\nHe found them another T shirt shop to deliver the exact same shirt and the exact same price but that wasn't good enough it wasn't that they wanted to be entitled to have their shirts which they clearly God\nThey wanted to have a pound of flesh to go with it and so they're trying to punish plane out of ... and and hopefully we won that case in the court of appeals [noise] um and hopefully that will be for him to the Kentucky Supreme Court if if not\nWe'll be taking that keeps us for it\nI I just saw an unbelievable number um how how many uh different attorneys do you put out in the field to defend these cases with the ATF the alliance defending freedom\nThat we have a sixty attorneys on staff and three thousand allied attorneys that I'm going to hear their time sometimes it reduced rate sometimes absolutely free but we have a big team that are willing to come in and and help Christians and other people all over the country\nWho have real religious freedom and freedom of speech problems\nWell that's a that's a very a very significant um army if you have the three thousand volunteer attorneys\nAnd by the way what we're talking to you because right now today is friday we are going into the weekend you will feel great and you'll have more reason to celebrate and feel grateful over the weekend if you can do something to um\nTo help the alliance defending freedom go to our website at Michael midday dot com you can read more about their fascinating work and some of these important cases\nAnd see what this great organization led by Michael ...

you more of a right than people born abroad\nTo enjoy the blessings of this country isn't that basic isn't that sensible\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd then making ... concedes a truly open borders policy has no constituency in the American electorate but it's the implicit philosophical framing of most news media stories on immigration\nWhich tend to focus on the

wants to come because doing so well transformed this country\nInto one the few Americans of any political persuasion would want to live in the United states would be vastly more unequal and income and opportunity migrants would languishing the kind of squalid poverty\nThat the United states hasn't seen for a century in numbers a doubling of the U.S population is probably a conservative estimate that would defeat any conceivable tax and transfer program\nOkay this is the core argument simply allowing people in is a disaster for the country and it's not a a blessing for the people who are allowed in because\nBy encouraging more and more and more and more immigration with no limit\nWhat you're doing is undermining undermining the vitality and prosperity and opportunity that those people

president job you would probably Germans country\nAnd another great day and the greatest nation on God's green earth agreed days for people who like\nAdventure stories in the style of Tom Clancy because there's a new movie out is based upon\nA novel that was actually written by a real submarine commander and is about a special kind of submarine which is known as a hunter killer submarine\nSaturday submarine that is designed to find\nOther submarine or the movie stars or our butler and the Oscar winner Gary Oldman Oscar winner for his great role is Winston Churchill\nIn darkest hour as the new movie is called hunter killer we will be a revealing that coming up and it's um if you like a film and you do get some of them celebrating a the valor and heroism and and technical achievements of the American military\nThis might be a film that you will want to see uh I Do not know what kind of film they're going to make about Caesar say a coup suddenly is one of the most famous people in the country he\nOf course is the fifty six year old a Florida resident\nWho was just arrested earlier today and his being interrogated and being charged with the series of fourteen bomb packages that he dispatched to all kinds of famous\nLiberal folks and I'd Jeff Sessions the attorney general of the United states announced\nArrest or just a couple of hours ago listen\nAmply to participate in this amount that I suspect is in the city or the FBI I Want to remind everyone to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged to die\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive\nIllegal mailing of explosive threats against former presidents and certain other person's threatening interstate communications fan of solving current and former federal officers for these charges the defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nOkay and the the details are just coming in\nOn say or say occupy this individual who has been arrested who apparently first of all his DNA has been identified his fingerprints have been identified those are two separate but both very compelling bits of evidence tying him to the mailing in these packages\nAnd here's part of what we know about him and his criminal record which is very extensive I'll share with you comes from the Florida department of law enforcement\nAnd the time of his last arrest which was in two thousand Fifteen he was five eleven and two hundred and Fifteen pounds yes brown eyes black hair and a scar on his left\nArm he was born in New York the records\nList or Mr say ox occupation as manager it's not clear what he managed or has ever managed she certainly didn't manage his own affairs very well according to um uh two thousand twelve bankruptcy petition that he filed in Miami\nMr ... or resigned at the time and his mom's home a handwritten note on the petition said lives with mom has no furniture and this is two thousand twelve so he was fifty at the time\n\nThat some residents of Avon tour of Florida\nReported seeing is very distinctive white van and the the photographs of his fight white van show that the windows not the windshield and not the rear windshield but the windows on the side of the van are entirely covered with various bumper stickers and messages\nAnd images of various liberal icons including Van Jones and Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton with crosshairs on them and he has a another image of uh\nIllegal immigrants as they're supposed to be with crosshairs on them and it says I have a dream liberal melt down\nA it says are lured here\nBy liberals are millions of illegals are forced to cross the border by fear of a Trump presidency\nThan a ... there's a other indications and pictures of President Trump now I Know it it looks like this is some kind of stunned to try to discourage\nTrump supporters from supporting him because nobody wants to be associated with somebody like this that by the way if there there are those of you out there who who really think yeah this is my guy I'm I'm Glad to be associated with him uh I don't think you even want to call the call it's critical to show but you can one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nI think the idea that this is some kind of set up by some level and forces that this guy is not a sincere Trump supporter is bogus it's ridiculous they going back to look at his\nEntire Facebook history and his Facebook history going back until two thousand Fifteen is all about Trump and lots and lots of Trump for president he's posted big excerpts of Trump's speech at a rally\nAnd he has this van he may have been living in ... in it\nSome residents Ventura reported of\nSeeing a similar white van covered in pro Trump stickers\nOften part in a lot of a local strip mall\nAnd somebody who saw that van who's a documentary film producer and editor\nNamed David ... can set it struck me because of the crazy conspiratorial stickers covering the windows it was unsettling and also it seemed to be occupied in other words some and living there sometimes the door would be a jar or window would be open which indicated to me that maybe someone was living in the van\nPresident Trump has spoken very appropriately he said these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country we must never allow political violence to take root in America he was just outside the White House moments ago and they shouted a question at the president\nWould you yourself pledge Mr President to tone down the rhetoric for the next few days\nAnd here's what the president said he said I think I've been toned down if you want to know the truth that is the truth is he has been toned down in the last few days but then he added this he said I could really tone it up because there's you know the media has been extremely unfair to me into the Republican Party\n[noise] um do you know can we play because we should for President Trump my a grand daughter's favorite song which is let it go she doesn't really know the lyrics she just knows that and she knows let it\nGo let it go let it go let it go\nOkay she doesn't sing as she's not to yet but President Trump should get the message of between now and election day\n[noise] I I don't think that winning in these clothes districts that we have to win because otherwise the Democrats are going to take control of the house of representatives\nUh I I don't think it helps to continually go after media and to suggest that they are deliberately lying\nAnd now they get stories where all the time they show by us all the time but the idea of deliberately making things up and lying\nThe president tweeted a very big part of the anger we\nSee today in our society has caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news\nIt has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast they\nDo try to clean up their act when they get things wrong I Am very very often they will apologize I there was an outrageous story early in the Trump Administration\nI'm sure many of you remember where they were reporting in time magazine that the president of the United states had ordered the removal of a bust of Martin Luther king that never happened it didn't exist and within four hours after posting that story they apologize and took it down\nAnd it's outrageous that they made the mistake in the first place and there's no excuse for it but at least you respond the same way when you move back\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six I actually believe that politically this thing should buy writes benefit to president of the United states I'll tell you why\nBecause people said they were so worried about Trump weakening the FBI people are worried about it they should build backup confidence about the FBI\nAnd may have injured and\nThen he was arrested in two thousand four for possession of a controlled substance without a prescription and within tend to sell\nSounds like selling perhaps painkillers perhaps opioids in Nineteen Ninety One\nI pleaded guilty to a charge of their degree grand theft and was sentenced to a fine and two years' probation is there something wrong with our criminal justice system if a guy who is this dysfunctional is not actually sent to prison\nA woman named ... filed a civil complaint against they opt for domestic violence in Nineteen Ninety four\nHe also has a history of financial troubles can't imagine why a two bedroom two bath house\nHe owned in Fort Lauderdale was foreclosed in two thousand nine three years after he\nPurchased that say I filed for bankruptcy in two thousand twelve now all of this is terribly sad\nIt's it's very very sad but it I think defeats the frankly cop Khamenei narrative that\nThis is somehow a democratic stunt and the the best proof to me that it's not a democratic stunt will be the fact that\nIt will have no impact on the polls and will have no impact on the election what will have an impact on the election of President Trump and his administration performing well\nIn protecting us and identifying this guy and apprehending him and now bringing him to some kind of justice\nLet's go to Matt Mesa, Arizona Matt you're on the man that show\nAnd Michael thanks for having me on your um look\nHey I I totally understand how it can sound cocky media can sound crazy but the way the world is right now I think it's a woman in the whole thing when we say that things like CNN the fake news\nBut they don't operate from a place of 'em just irrationality sometimes when they called people like\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center and and there are ... members for doing a you know war justice work social justice work I wait wait I've never\nI've never heard CNN describe antifa as doing social justice work and try to describe themselves as social justice warriors and that's your job or their sucks but I've never heard I've never heard CNN or MSNBC or any major mainstream media source say that end teeth all was good guys\nWell at least the the point that I'm trying to make is they're not out clearly making them out to be the bad guy and the people who are the the voice that they have on their network at least hold them to a high regard and they're not shutting down and and I totally understand that but\nThat that you look I think what you're saying is true I think there's a profound biased throughout media news and it's it's very very biased and they they certainly treat neo Nazis a much more harshly or Proud Boys much more harshly than\nThey train antifa anti deserves just the same kind of contempt and just the same kind of criticism but that's different from making things up\nThey are and and to say that people are deliberately fabricating stories is a very different charge we'll be

I that I I really like\nStuffed a wise guy America\nTo hyper sophisticated fools that um habits so many of our urban areas that are have gone to graduate school too long and become stupid\nSo that's my that's my initial take\nI hey everybody not just stupid callous jaded mean but other than that I think okay producing terrific people yeah\nBeen be so what is it now seven thousand have you seen pictures of the caravan coming in from largely from Honduras\n\nLike to talk to somebody about how many uh how how did they get through the Mexican border the Mexicans just don't care I I keep hearing conflicting reports that it's not clear to me they only let six hundred forty and then there are seven thousand so is it six hundred forty years at seven thousand [noise]\nAnd it's it looks like seven thousand to me it's a mile long and again the question is how did they just have such a large group get through Mexico not that I think Mexico cares\nA substantial part of their population lives in the United states and funds Mexico makes them back billions of dollars and\nWe take the unemployed off Mexico's hands I mean we're essentially were a no ... government of Mexico and the United states and the left thinks that that is a terrific thing even though all it does is enable the Mexicans to avoid confronting their own issues\nIf every country could send all those who are not employed or all those who are unhappy to another country why should you deal with any of your problems but hey that's you know\nThat that pales that question pales in the significance compared to the possibility\nOf more Democrats\nBecause if you can't make enough Democrats in your own population you need to import Democrats so that you can win more elections that's what they do the imports Democrats\nMet an amazing thing is that done anywhere else in the world and the democracy we import millions of people in order to have you will like that that's what it's about\nAnd they it's a it's a big question we should have some folks on because the big question here how are they going to be stopped she misses me my fear is is that\nThey will obviously they will have to be physical stoppage of people but not going to come to the border and they'll say please turn around okay we'll go back ... thousand miles or was Seventeen hundred miles out of I don't know what the\nDistances back to Honduras\nBy the way I just want to add I feel for every one of these people like totally feel for them\nTo live in Latin America is largely to live in a corrupt society\nSeats are fascinating thing we're supposed to we're supposed to ... that they should come into the United states because things are so terrible for them but if you say why things are so terrible for them then the left accuses you obscene a phobia or racism\nSee they're really fleeing wonderful places where where there is little corruption and great opportunity they just prefer California 'cause they they like our beaches but of course they have beaches as a hunter is just not landlocked to the best of my knowledge\nSo I I don't ah [laughter] you have\nTo live in this make believe world that are on the left is created there's no difference between American culture Latin American culture no none whatsoever American culture was not superior and the moral way to Latin American culture\nBut everybody wants to flee vast numbers won a fleet they're equally wonderful cultures to come to our less wonderful or equally wonderful or non wonderful culture get it that's what you're supposed to believe if you are college educated to\nThere's no difference there's no moral distinction between Latin American the American culture\nThat's amazing I guess while you are so many Americans fleeing to hunger us why should they be why should they be impoverished they have food they've perfectly perfectly acceptable\nNatural resources\nThe reason Latin America is largely an economic failure is because it was largely\nCorrupt ask our friends in Brazil\nIs is is there a few as ... as in television industry is people was the Brazilians\nBut they're mired in corruption corruption is is the greatest problem outside of Iran on the face of the earth\n\nRock global warming my friend's corruption but nobody wants to talk about it because it sounds like you are attacking another culture but I Am attacking another culture\nI'm not attacking another race or another ethnicity or race or ethnicity or insignificant culture is everything\nSo I I don't know what will happen at the border I I don't know how they will be stopped they have but otherwise if you want them in that you are aligned to yourself and to everybody else if you deny your for open borders seven thousand people want to come in\nThat seven thousand more voters plus there plus their families the this is for the Democrats this is awesome\nI listened to the political pundits who are are divided on this list will be seen being good I mean we're approaching this hugely hugely nation changing election possibly\nThe American people choose a Democratic House you are going to just see a two years of hate filled investigation and some of the presidency\nTo try to bring him down to try to bring removed justice Kavanaugh that's all it will be will do nothing for the United states who will do everything for left wing power\nThe left wing is not interested in the United states and its interested in power but it's true in every country since lemon about talking about liberals but liberals are cowards they don't fight the left except Alan Dershowitz and and the Ruben than a few others [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat's the state of things this uh this Monday I won't give me the show one aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six so the question is who will\nLook better or worse for Democrats or Republicans if you want an open border it looks better or for a\nFor the Democrats if you believe that the United states has to protect the sovereignty it's better for Republicans\nThat's the answer but the point is they will undoubtedly be somebody will get hurt I it's very hard to imagine no young man has gone a scuffle with any American border enforcement agent and then get hurting and perhaps a child they will be more cameras there as many cameras there was\nPeople and then they they will be or they will be the usual from the left look at what look at the mean spirited president that we have\nLooked at these men and women and children though it's mostly young men but look at these men women and children the callous missing Gina phobia of this administration that's that's what you hear\nAnd they will they will have the you know the appropriate assigned or so appropriate images that they will be able to show\nOn CNN and MSNBC ABC CBS Seventy or B is BP beep beep beep beep beep beep you\nThat's what it is\nA question of do you believe in the right of a country to have brought people can have it's it's I don't understand why why don't people regard the country as they regard their home do you allow anybody into your home is your country not your home I think about this when people let her\nDo not regard your your city is your home how could you could you throw that garbage out of your car how could you throw that beer can on the ground\n\nOne a Prager seven seven six eight

you or not some value will then schedule a sixty minutes sit down at one of our offices where you could expand a little bit on what's important to you none of which costs any money will build up an entire roadmap free of charge because we're passionate about helping you understand\nThese principles it's too important and mistakes are too high so call right now one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine to get that number as one eight hundred seven six seven one five five nine\nKey there is never good convenient time to make the sacrifice of saving it's far too easy to put things off until later practice procrastination let me investigate the cost of procrastination a little more deeply\nIf you're Twenty years old and you want to raise a hundred grand by age sixty five again assuming that ten percent rate of return you realize you only need to save get this\nThirteen hundred and Seventy two dollars today so if you're Twenty years on you put one thousand three hundred and Seventy two dollars away today it will be an average rate of return it ten percent it will be a hundred grand at age sixty five\nIt's crazy right it's almost a hundred times what you put in however if you're fifty today and you want a hundred grand you need to invest nearly twenty four thousand to obtain the same so instead of Thirteen hundred you have to put away twenty four grand [noise]\nThis is the cost of procrastination\n... it's not money that makes you financially successful it's time it's not timing the market it's time in the market\nThat makes you successful I mean think about that the number one thing here she still what partners when I'm discussing things with clients in talking with clients and we're working with a lot of folks who are you know near enter enter in retirement will definitely work with some young professionals and business owners but I get the sort of this unique vantage point of talking with a lot of folks that are in their fifties and sixties\nAnd you know what the number one\nSort of regret and complained and reflection that many of our clients have when we're looking at their situation\nThe number one thing they say is I Wish I had started sooner I wished so badly I had understood this when I was in my twenties and thirties even my forties I would've helped so much because I mean think about that you need a little over a grand today if you're twenty\nTo have a hundred grand at retirement I mean think about how easy that is when you get the power of compound interest but again\nWe have to recognize rubber cross later so here's something practical a couple of practical things I Would tell you about saving the first one I think many of you realize this the first is really just automating your savings okay what\nThis means is turn things on auto pilot obviously if you're saving into a retirement plan at work it comes out of your paycheck you should automate all of your outside same in investing in the same way\nRight nowadays with online banking as a super simple just you can easily set up savings plans investment plans where they come out at whatever you want and they transfer money to the various accounts we do this for all of our clients\nIt's incredibly important because we are procrastinators if you have to proactively get out your checkbook which I mean shoot if you're a millennial you don't even know what a checkbook is probably but\nWe're not going to write a check every month like we're not going to do it the money's going to be gone you have to get it out of there and pay yourself before anything else happens just pretend you don't even have the money put it on auto pilot another really easy way to save money which we practice personally Brittany and I do is anytime you get unexpected money\nThat you weren't planning on getting just immediately deposit that into your investment account you will be amazed over the course of five or ten years how much money\nYou actually were able to squirrel away\nMoney you're not expecting right the last thing is every time you get a raise that work as you continue to progress in your career you may make more money you may have the benefit of getting some raises are earning more money here's the easiest way to manage those raises\nTake half of the race and save it right so if you're making a hundred grand right now and you get a raise and are going to make one twenty five\n... twelve five and invested\nSpend the other twelve five so enjoy it like give yourself the benefit of being able to increase your lifestyle a little bit and you know enjoy the fruits of your labor in your hard work because there is a balance between saving and enjoying stuff now I mean what's the point in you know stashing up a bunch of money and it just dying with this big account that you've never enjoyed or did anything with so that's a really easy practical way every\nTime you get a raise said half of it because you you're not gonna miss it you didn't have it before anyways plus you get to increase your lifestyle\nIt's a great way to kind of battle procrastination so number one again number one automate all your savings\nKnow you're a procrastinator the first step to you know healing is admitting so just know that you're a procrastinator automated number to save anything that's unexpected you get something that you weren't expecting maybe a tax refund you were thinking of an old money on your taxes you got three thousand back\nDon't go spend it just immediately put an investment account number three every time you get a pay increase or raise save half of it\nAnd I'd like to offer the next five colors the opportunity to come in and get our tailored retirement map of you\nKnow it's called the retirement map for a reason it's our one page roadmap that overviews your entire retirement situation\nYou know sometimes people will say John that sounds too simple it's only one page no it's not too simple\nIn fact for

Security planning in a myriad of other things that you have even thought of and we'll put here's the most part we put it on a one page giant go off the map\nThat's understandable that's a clear break down I mean I we used to build these massive like hundred page plans for people and by four pages in your eyes were gloss over and it was way too detailed and it wasn't relevant you couldn't make sense of it and it was just boring\nAnd now we do the map and the benefit to that as you're able to come in and say whoa I can actually see clearly on one spot the key components of my retirement like

you're listening to wherever you're listening thinks a lot\nFor making as a part of your day and on today's show were discussing before primary landmines that NPR progress as investors and it made me very different than some of the ones that you\nWould think at first thought would be true\nWe already covered procrastination and spending habits and if anything that we discussed raises questions in your mind maybe this is your first time listening to the show you just stumbled across it maybe you're someone who's listen to the show for months or even years but you've never taken a stop on a

team standing by right now one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine or getting a number one eight hundred seven six seven one five five nine\nAnd their objective is simply to get you

you've worked your lifetime to save of course I'm biased but I think it absolutely is and it all comes with no cost and no obligation again the number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine to schedule your one page\nRetirement map review call right now again the number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nIn the past couple of weeks on the podcast I've been discussing some of the land mines that trip us up in having financial success\nFirst of which was procrastination\nAnd last week I discuss how we're spending habits may impact or long term goals today we are going to discuss the\nThird landmine of the four most impactful hurdles and also accomplish in our goals and it's absolutely appropriate right now and it's very relevant because it's something that is being discussed\nOver and over in the news and that as inflation\nSince Nineteen twenty six inflation has averaged three percent per year\nAccording to the United States Department of labor and to put that in perspective our money must double every twenty three and a half years to keep a consistent standard of living consider how much money you spend each year on everything food clothes furniture children's needs transportation housing\nWhat ever that amount is what ever that monthly dollar amount is you're going to need to double that\nIn twenty three and a half years just to keep pace\nWith your current standard of living with the way you live life right now so imagine if you're fifty years old\nWhen you reach age Seventy three Seventy four you're going to need twice as much income just to live the same lifestyle that you are right now assuming that period represent a normal inflationary time period now let's look at this historically I mean think about it for a forty year old by the time you reach your mid eighties you're going to need\nFour times as much money as you have right now just to keep up with inflation just to live the same lifestyle that you are right now now how does this impact us as investors\nWill you must take action to grow your money to be sure that it can keep up and meet your needs so here's a little self assessment if you are not saving\nIf you are not receiving regular pay increases at work\nIf you don't have money invested in vehicles that will beat inflation will respond positively during inflationary time periods or if you are not earning regular adequate rates of return on your investments you are losing money\nIt's not just that you're not growing it as efficiently as you'd like do you are actually losing money\nNow in a low interest rate environment like we've seen since the financial collapse and two thousand and eight\nOftentimes savers or people that we referred to in our industry is safe money investors you know maybe a felt secure and the fact that\nThey weren't losing any money in bank accounts or short term interest bearing accounts but unfortunately\nThey're real rate of return relative to inflation has been absolutely negative\nI remember every twenty three and a half years on average you need to double your money just to create as much retirement income as you enjoyed in the past for the practical analogy I just wrote an article for the hill last month specifically on inflation\nSo let's look a practical example of this put a frog and boiling water and it will instinctively jump out put a frog in tepid water and slowly increase the heat to a boil and it will not perceive the danger an intern be cooked at\nLeast that's the premise for a late nineteenth century fable that serves as a metaphor for our inability an unwillingness to react or be aware of threats that arise gradually\nAnd that subtle threat regarding our money our president is none other than inflation so this is something not only is it a landmine that I write about my book", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "27", "locations": [["Pittsburgh", 40.44062, -79.99589], ["Russia",

to make sure that as you vote as you encourage your neighbors to vote as you get ready to go to the\nPolls don't believe the lie that somehow but rocked Obama\nSets the groundwork for this tremendous economy we're enjoying right now Fred Barnes says in his column ... is a must read we're gonna posted it Mike online dot com if you want to read it read Barnes rights but rock Obama is a proud men\nAnd it was somewhat in Deering when he ... to ... to claim he had created the ground on which Trump's economy was growing the media sided with Obama no surprise\nTrump counter punched no surprise there either if the Democrats that won the election twenty sixteen Trump said GDP which was about one percent and going down would have been minus four percent instead of up four point two percent Trump tweeted\nHe's referring before point two percent he's referring to the growth rate for the second quarter of twenty Eighteen\nI opened up our beautiful economic engine with regulation in tax cuts are system was choking and would have been made worse still plenty to do read Barnes writes the Weekly Standard Donald Trump is correct\nAbout the condition of the economy and late twenties sixteen it was weakening the shift in economic policy to the right change the direction of gross from down to up\nThat's what tax cuts deliver\nAnd tax hikes do not use the Fred Barnes writes about Obama and this lie that Obama is the reason for today's economy and again it spread puts it Obama's proud man\nIt's kind of been during that he had such a head makes such a silly claim here are some facts ... Obama's successor Trump and the Republican Congress reverse Obama's policies\nThe fact is Obama had to struggle so hard to spur the economy and allow it to grow more than two percent a year that was the high watermark with Iraq Obama in the last quarter of Obama's presidency growth has slipped to one point five percent\nIt's obvious what Obama's problem was he had the wrong policies watch of wrong policies from the day Trump was elected\nWe've had a more real best robust economy\nNearly four million jobs have been added four million jobs unemployment is up to the lowest point in nearly a half century ... Barnes says let's compare what Obama did with Trump\nWhat he's doing Obama raised taxes Trump cut them Obama was where did you look tore zealots Trump is passionate about deregulation Obama's clean Power Plan killed the coal industry Trump is reviving it\nObama downgraded the role of entrepreneurs and free markets in boosting the economy and a lot of the wonderful things government does Obama's biggest biggest breakthrough as we know was\nThe Affordable CARE Act a big step toward a single payer government run health care system Trump got rid of the individual mandate that forced everyone to buy expensive insurance or be fined a big step toward a return to free markets in health care\nBill the entire Obama economic agenda was systematically reversed says economics writer Stephen Moore\nWhose new book Trump ... we've got to get even more and Arthur Laffer Lance on the show one of these days presidents loved to tell their achievements in Trump's case\nA White House report issued recently said is a bit of stretching had produced two hundred and eighty nine accomplishments in twenty months we all know Trump exaggerates and brags Fred Barnes rights but many of the economic gains more impressive\nEspecially the fact that job openings out number job seekers but the first time on record being liberal himself Obama relied on liberal economists they let him astray\nAs they did president John Kennedy in the Nineteen sixties they favored higher taxes to bay favored increase spending\nThose policies created an economic downturn but Kennedy was smarter than Obama\nGallagher I always hate it when the caller I Want to go to the most hangs up or get disconnected or whatever I had a caller who said you can't degrade what\nObama did for our country when he was president [noise]\nHe didn't say that I said that this economy that we're in joined in twenty eight team is not as a result of any of the rock Obama's policy just the opposite very important distinction sorry you didn't hang on should we do have had that exchanged who do you think\nThough that this migrant what party do you think benefits from this migrant care of in the Republican Party for the Democrats Laura things this will be good for the Democrats and bad for the Republicans like to find out what her thinking is on this how you doing Laura welcome to the Mike Gallagher show\nAnd gray how are ya\nI'm good thanks why do you think this will benefit the Democrats are not the Republicans\nWell I'm worried I don't think I'm getting worried because they're going to be a lot it killed there and and families and yeah I'm afraid it right the whole cannon ran out saying with the military there and [noise] ...\nYeah\nIt will be going out all this thing yeah yeah I I don't I think we're in a different time though Laura I really do guy who's just a different time where people are fed up I\nI don't under I don't hear a lot of people having a great amount of sympathy for thousands of people marching towards the United states it feels like an invasion even if there are children along with men and women where do we want to hear what the president had to say about it last night at his rockers rally\nIn Montana we've got the video and the audio we want to join us in my online dot com and joined us on air one eight hundred six five five my thanks for more coming up\n\nThe other problem with these fancy ... a tooth brushes that are electric they are they cost an arm and a leg they're very expensive and it's a pain in the neck to replace the the brush head which my doctor my doctor tells me all the time you got to replace them once a month sensitive sonic vibrations are available from the new quipped toothbrush\nQuip is amazing I Love quip I've I've read that quip but I found out and doing my due diligence they're backed up by over ... backed by over twenty thousand dental\nProfessionals equipped starts at just twenty five dollars and if you go to get ... dot com slash my G. you'll get your first rebuilt pack for free with a quip electric toothbrush now there's just quit Q.

for Steven Meyer director of the center for science and culture at the discovery Institute in Seattle or would you tell people I think it's important given that\nWe're going to talk about science and face so 'til people don't be humble about some of your credentials in the in that arena\nSure um I as you mentioned direct is a network of scientist or run out of the discovery Institute in Seattle [noise]\nUh uh my ... and the philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge in England prior to that I worked as a geophysicist and did a double a physics geology or science degree in undergraduate and um [noise]\nAh Britain a couple a couple of bucks one signature on the cell and the question of the origin of the first life and the second one called Darwin's doubt\nA which is a question of about the origin of the first animals which uh prepare very abruptly in the fossil record in Contra addiction to Darwin's own expectations of a very gradual origin for for animal life so your life has been immersed\nIn science by the way just I've never asked you this and all our time both privately and the radio when public what does the philosophy of science\nMean [noise] it's the it's the discipline that addresses scientific questions that are right at the margin of science and philosophy things about\nThe nature and uh [noise] basis of human knowledge the what's called in philosophy pissed about how we know what we know but also questions about a new consciousness the origin of the university origin of life [noise]\nUm [noise] and needed is that the topics that have always really fascinated me how did we get here how did life get here\nUm there's a huge scientific dimension to these questions but they also have incorrigible eve philosophical implications and so\nI've always been attracted right at that boundary between the two and you have to learn a lot of science to be any good in it and you have to be thinking philosophically to make any sense of a\nGreat combination did you enjoy your time became a mentally really now if you have to do if you have to do something is grueling as a PHD it's nice to do it in some place like Cambridge or Oxford weather a lot of cultural compensation some wonderful people and the weather helps the weather's awful but I'm going to Seattle so I was\nAlready not late at night I never thought about\nHis latest book which he edited is a collection of essays\nAnd don't let the title of it in any way that you prefer you stick evolution a scientific philosophical of logical critique Miller worth the ... revolution is\nThe attempt of many and very good will people to reconcile God and evolution and this is a series of essays critic critique critical of that position that position\nSo let me get to that the book is up a tennis player dot com and obviously I mean if you were interested in theology or science will find this immensely interesting\nSo I I missions you right before we went on the air that I until really I ... you to be honest\nUh my my view was I didn't really care about evolution and it didn't bother me if it was true and it didn't bother me if it wasn't true I Believe in God as the creator of happens in the earth the God of genesis one\nAnd if if God used evolution water why care it's all a miracle anyway so back in ... in a nutshell Ben I I read to you and talk to you\nAnd my wife frankly whose loans or a fair amount of you know about evolution and and uh it has become less and less tenable not for religious reasons but for scientific reasons\nToo but to\nEndorse the evolution as it is generally taught so before we get to garden evolution\nI noticed is ridiculous in the time that I'm getting me give you a couple of minutes can summarize\nEvolution and why it's now eh we might be skeptical about well not not only we yeah okay [noise] uh but but scientists right this is what you are but in my mind to scientists are having trouble with that but right right okay go ahead so quick\nDefinitions of the term evolution for orientation the first is simply change over time nobody nobody challenges that there has been change overtime or the kind of small scale variation we see in Galapagos spin speaks or peppered Mavs or um bacteria that acquire an to an antibiotic resistance that's sometimes called micro evolution\nUm second definition bed allusion is the idea of universal common descent and the idea that all organisms are connected by common ancestry back to one where very few simple forms such that the best picture of the history of life is like a giant branching tree as part of Darwin's argument\nAnd and the third most controversial meaning of evolution is the idea that there's an ... guided directed mechanism namely natural selection acting on random mutations that can produce all the new forms of life that have emerged in the history of life the producers all the change over time\nAnd that that mechanism um is also responsible for the appearance of design that that ... biological systems manifested even leading evolutionary biologist acknowledge\nSo those are three key definition is the first is a knock us nobody doubts that the second is somewhat controversial the third is relief stains on my second on the tree I'm I'm skeptical about the the universal common descent there's a lot of this continuity in the fossil record and then the genomic a patterns that we're now observing\nA but the key issue and the one that leading evolutionary biologist themselves are now questioning is the idea that the mutation selection mechanism as genuine creative power the ability to generate fundamentally new forms of life\nAh so what you hear a lot of evolutionary biologist quoting now an aphorism is that\nA mutation selection explains the survival but not the arrival of the fittest explains a small scale variations but nothing major innovations in virtue of that uh two years ago this time um I was at a conference that of the royal society in Britain the oldest or\nIn arguably must August scientific body in the world they called a conference to a assess modern neo Darwinism and specifically to call for\nA an a new theory of evolution many of the evolutionary biologist there were deeply unhappy with the idea that mutation and selection as creative power the opening talk at the conference by gerd Mohler leading Austrian evolutionary biologist\nAnd numerous rated or several key what he called explanatory deficit of the modern version of Darwin's theory neo Darwinism that a number of the the the deficits that he enumerated were things that I had written on at length in my own book Darwin's doubt\nThis stunning the the Royal Society what is the full name\nThe royal society of London it was started by Robert Boyle Newton was one of its first\nPresident was yeah yeah just raving about them yesterday okay [noise] so they that's incredible that you had a conference on the weaknesses of the traditional Darwinian explanation whip where most\nIf not all of the talks were were exploring some new mechanisms that could supplement compliment replace\nThe standard mutation selection mechanism the odd thing about the conference however was that uh there were a group of of what they called themselves the third way people they don't want to associate with those of us who are um supportive of intelligent design and that is a growing number of scientists by the way\nAnd the and as we've understood more about the digital nature of the information that really isn't it alphabetical type of graphic or digital in character\nAnd uh and we understand that by reference to our own experience with computer code of the idea that you could randomly start to change very specific arranged\nThe ... of characters that are designed to construct one thing\nAnd turn them into another message that will construct another completely different thing it's implausible if you take a section of computer code and start randomly changing the zeroes and ones you're not going to produce a new program or operating system you're going to introduce glitches and bugs and you'll ... ultimately destroy the function of the original sequence that you had\nAnd the genetic sequences similarly vulnerable to that kind of\nA random mutations will change and yet the neo Darwinian invoke random mutations the ages of innovation the aging of creation when in fact it's either a an Asian of destruction or it can and introduce very minor preserve ... changes that might slightly tweak her optimize\nOur eyes and when I hear you say this I'm thinking of all the ... pre eminent scientists of the last hundred years\nWho have believed what you say is the cannibal what does that say if you are right what does that say about scientists that science like\nUh every other form of human endeavor can be subject to group think\nOr to ... uh or it can be influenced by prior ideological commitments\nIn particular in the debate about biological origin there is a prior commitment to a materialistic approach to the question it's codified in a principle known as methodological nationalism\nAnd it says that if you're going to be a true scientist you have to limit yourself to strictly materialistic explanation for everything not just how nature ordinarily operates which would be quite sensible but where in nature itself came from\nAnd that principle Ben precludes the possibility of a ... a precludes consideration of designing intelligence and yet what did we discovered that the foundation of life we've discovered digital code\nA Bill Gates the our local hero in a in in the Seattle area says the DNA is like a software program only much more complex than we've ever device but where does suffer come from it comes from a mind we have all sorts of indications of intelligent um\nActivity at the foundation of life we've got digital code we have a a complex information processing system we have nano technology miniature machines that um are a mind blowing in their integrated complexity we've got circuitry controlling the expression of genetic information\nAnd know persuasive Darwinian explanation has been offered for any of this type of complexity the integrated or organizational complexity at\nThe most likely all some aberration was born and prosper because it was better than the previous ... a ...\nA a a plausible theory in the nineteenth century was formulated by Darwin before we knew about the complexity of life at the microscopic and molecular level\nUh in the wake of that theory of a a principle of reasoning was codified among scientists namely that we must limit ourselves to materialistic ... explanations of the kind that Darwin a promulgated and then as the evidence from the Nineteen fifties sixties and write to the president has begun to stack up\nEvidence that would in any other realm of experience point to designing intelligence that the principal of methodological naturalism has prevented many scientists from considering the obvious right Haitian\nOkay I'm totally on board the ... the question that you have taught me to to ask is or even the people who only believe in a a naturalist\nX or material explanation are they starting to question traditional\nThey are All right hold on that's what we'll get the answer to [noise]\nYou live by yeah by reading a

going to lose lose big\nAnd as the night wore on it is all the predictions they kept making she can't win Iowa he can't win Ohio he can't take Florida he's not going to win Pennsylvania and all those predictions one by one\nThey kept being proven wrong since the end of the night\nShe was forced to look into the camera and say something like you're not dreaming you're not in hell this is our wife now she's got tears in her eyes I mean even Brian Williams at one point he\nGroans when Trump takes one of the battleground states just grow ... no objectivity at all these guys are horribly biased and we all know that\nWe all know it and the Democrats and the story about was warned so bad stuff is so bad\nLie about your heritage to get advancements at Harvard line about serving your country and and try to be elected US Senator\nThere they're shown\n[noise] this last night and that's about eight or nine minutes long but it's worth it if you're a ... especially if you're a Batman fan like I was as a\nKid I I grew up watching Batman and Robin and you know the the TV series in I guess what the sixties right so they they put together all these clips of election night twenty six gene\nUh interspersed with Batman editorial comments and bow and ... we showing how the mainstream media had egg on their face\nOr as President Trump won and the reason it's ... it's a impactful could happen November districts you better could check this out Mike online dot com if you're by computer you don't want to watch this and listen to this enjoy\nWe have a poll out of Pennsylvania this is a brand new poll that came out a couple of hours ago NBC News marathon will look at this double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania hardly the first double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania this is the third one we've seen in a week for her so Donald Trump\nPennsylvania is a big target but all the evidence we have right now says Pennsylvania is still favored to be a democratic state\nActually that don't want to say [laughter]\nYou know for Hillary Clinton [noise]\nWhat about Ohio we have a brand new part of Ohio Donald Trump doing a little better here but he's still down in Ohio a five point gap so again right now Donald Trump targeting Ohio just like he targeting Pennsylvania but he's not there right now Clinton still meeting in Ohio\n[laughter] you're protecting truck shrill oh\nAnother one brand new NBC Marist Poll out of Iowa today again a little bit closer\nBut a four point lead for Hillary Clinton this is supposed to be a light target for Donald Trump he at his convention he'd had chances here he was out there in the for the caucuses earlier this year he is still trailing in this poll in Iowa closer he could turn it around but again for right now is Donald Trump ahead in Iowa not in this poll\nProjects Donald Trump will win the state of Ohio\nWe don't have a new poll today but Wisconsin and Michigan these or other states Donald Trump has talked about flipping with the rust belt strategy we have not seen a poll that puts in the head nice state\nSharing with Stockton electoral votes\nSo again the boat and is still on Donald Trump to show that he can do something and Mitt Romney in a whole bunch of other Republicans over the last generation or so I couldn't do and that is actually when the state that's the first thing that's going wrong for Trump the bigger problem is this though these are the blue states he thinks he can fit\nHow about the red state he needs to hold how about the state's Rodney one in twenty twelve the Trump maybe it's just assuming he can a whole second this out\nBrand new numbers out of North Carolina North Carolina was Mitt Romney state in twenty twelve little right now in this poll Hillary Clinton has delayed very close certainly Donald Trump could still when I called a tossup states but we have seen polls putting Hillary Clinton ahead there it is possible Hillary Clinton could end up flipping North Carolina making it a blue state\nOf another say it as a set of North Carolina I say it's all about Trump Fifteen electoral votes [noise]\nTrump's problem no gets a lot worse than North Carolina look at this and Georgia new poll seven point lead here for Hillary Clinton not the first poll that we've seen putting or hadn't Georgia this is the state the last one democratic\nBack in Nineteen Ninety two again Donald Trump could still take Georgia but Hillary Clinton certainly has a chance to flip Georgia\nEnough rejects that Donald Trump will carry the state of Georgia [noise]\nBut if Hillary Clinton could sustain the kind we see as we got into an ... into this race you could see other states that suddenly get crazy states it wouldn't be the magic of South Carolina even at Texas they could at least\nBecome competitive and what it would mean doesn't mean Hillary Clinton's going to win all the it means we could have more competitive states than we ever imagined\nYou think with the with the south Carolina and Kansas and be not just likely not likely slam dunk slash and guaranteed flash obviously it is the red South Carolina in Kansas but instead they're like read there just lean Republican now South Carolina\nRepublican state of South Carolina has gone Republican [noise]\nLeans Republican Trump or we project but when the Kansas with six electoral votes [noise]\nAnd if those are the tossup states\nCan do the math associated with all the electoral votes from all the states that they go that way you have to lean Republican and the likely Republican go read and to lean Democrat and likely Democrat and go blue [noise]\nHe say that Donald Trump hasn't even Bastille Day in the entire world completely opposite of expectations and he wins without that face he wins\nElectoral college vote in\nThe days after the when all of the top so to be insane because nobody wins all of the top states even if Donald Trump did when all of the states with Phyllis\nToo harsh\nOr the tensions\nIn terms of what time is up there is only five\nStates that are still considered a toss up right now Florida\nI've seen that project Donald Trump will carry the state of Florida [noise]\nProjects Donald Trump will win the state of Iowa within six electoral votes\nUnderestimate the good citizens of Gotham City she took a\nPoll and democratic calling harm but this is a real calling from this is legit methodology\nPoliticians trust voters not supposed\nTo say Christian Wilker standing by Clinton corner\nSomewhere here from John some\nYou know what we now have had it over here have been about that in the campaign marginally are\nWell over an hour and\nThere is only for his own man I mean for me there was\nA man now we only ... leads the way here\nI never want to believe that the polls could be wrong with other candidates who trusted too much of the polls Marilyn said and I found out that it's the votes to count\nThere as how\nSo many Hillary Clinton supporters are reacting thing I can hand held yeah come on and say go home when I was saying how can I mean there are places that are either too too early cause\nPeople are basically robbing they're merely reacting to their surroundings [noise]\nMore no trouble [noise]\nJune twenty eight or nine [noise]\nShort cut over several indeed that's why there are\nSome welfare covering the Clinton campaign crust and [noise]\nNow confirmed that Secretary Clinton has conceded\nHis concession took place in a phone call we anticipate you know and as we are waiting Donald Trump taking the stage here that is a new at this hour Secretary Clinton\nOr the cost of tuition is the cornerstone of our mission\nHelping agree even if Donald Trump dead when all of my face he would still is\nA historic moment we can now rejected winner of the presidential race projects\nDonald Trump elected president of the United states\nExperienced teachers slowly rough [noise]\nThe costs of many mistakes\nBabies a stunning shocking development for her supporters waited hours here at the Javits Center here from her when it appeared Israel and it was difficult\nNumber of broke out and get here started leaving early grief starting to set in one of her supporters told me this is a political upset a huge huge portion of holding the event here at the center have this feeling\nHoping to make\nAnd democratic calling him about this isn't real calling from this is legit methodology\nSelections are not won by pose commissioner or one votes at least in this country [noise]\nYou're not having a terrible terrible dream also you're not dead and you haven't gone to how\nWas twenty three and a tree and we'll be invited to a free barbecue Munch hosted by the leaves and you have until

who's just treated as she hopes you go and find her early voting location and go vote for her to become your next you know state senator congresswoman Blackburn out goes your race for the Senate welcome\nWell thank you so much in the race is going so well we are really encouraged we know that the only poll that counts is a poll on than we are working hard to make certain that they're all I thought about that when the when\nThe never turned up very much attention to one poll but I look at a trend a congresswoman Blackburn last\nUh September or anything on nine Fifteen CNN said you were behind your voter by five percent Fox News came back a couple of weeks later they said Marsha Blackburn up by five\nThen CBS News came back a few days later and they said Marsha Blackburn the prairie [laughter] and then the New York times came in two days ago and said you're up by fourteen what's going on in Tennessee you're you're surging eroded away with it\nEither positive message and getting out and people are focusing on that they want to make certain that they continue to have some more can constitutional\nJustices and judge it they want to keep the tax cuts they want to\nBuild the wall and they want to make certain that we are getting regulatory relief that we're dealing with the out of control spending and they're remembering some of the things Phil Bredesen dead as governor and if they really didn't like things like increasing the state budget by forty percent and getting\nPicked up on the house and the illegal aliens valid state issued taxpayer funded dry leaf certificates and barely member many drained the race fun and spent that money\nOn um on on the general fund and these are all things that they opposed they also he's are paying attention to the fact that\nHe was governor he had two different tracks for handling sexual harassment allegations and claims if your friend the pale does matters were handled privately and ... and\nOthers went through the regular state process\nSo people don't a light he'd get those things ... remember that they know that if he were to go to the U.S Senate that he would be his boss will be Chuck Schumer\nAnd that he had to have friends named Dianne Feinstein a Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Cory Booker Kamala Harris and Tennessee and when he never go to the polls and vote for him though the individual but they know about the film breath and it's a ...\nTo be clear Marsha Blackburn you would have voted to confirm justice cabinet and he would have voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch\nCertainly by and I had no problem making up my mind about that because Tennessee and she may not want an activist judges they want and good\nConstruction is constitutional or set up by the U.S constitution\nEnded a little walk now my pen at a chicken eighty eight days and make it lined up on particular do an after the vote is can he said well I Would have voted yes and then of course of airtime video came out these shows and that that was probably\nNot a trace of state and said he said that for political a wreath on this and that was very revealing what it can say in that video\nI Do see some signs of desperation and so Brad Olson a congresswoman Blackburn who's now offered to meet with President Trump in other words is going down for the third time and he's got a hand above the water saying hey anybody pay attention to me\nI don't think President Trump's going to be invited into the rose garden anytime soon President Trump's with you and Mitch McConnell's with you and I guess it comes down to I always have faith\nIn the average voter understanding that the control the Senate go through every as fifty one vote she writes\nThat try to and\nTennessee and he can now that it failed daddy and were there it took me about the Democrats and he um he is trying to as you said this is a sign of desperation and he says I'll go meet with the president or you know he put your finger in the wind which way it's boiling and says yes I Would have voted\nFor cabinet out such a trace it that if he were in charge it's his friends Hillary Clinton said he get thirty three thousand four hundred dollars to long they turn to the president if she was president he somebody like a justice capitalize dying Feinstein\nChairman of the Judiciary Committee he would not have somebody like a justice Kavanaugh\nRon Paul because they would not allow it and that's what makes it\nAs they seem to think safe for Democrats to stay one thing they're campaigning into another thing to say\nNow was ... approaching congresswoman Blackburn and by the way both Marcia is her Twitter handle boat Marcia you can follow her on Twitter you can go to Marsha Blackburn for sort of what is the website the congresswoman\nMarsha Blackburn dot com you walk or a place to go down to ... that can keep in touch with\nAnd they can contribute because right now you're getting water and with money and right you're getting all the outside groups on and to try and take the Democrats can't win the Senate if they don't beat you\nUp to ... mine as a candidate that he's had a white fifty well\nAnd we know that and yet he like George Soros son die out all the liberal friends find that a lot of ties in the east coast are there out there pouring money into this race and so we do need to help\nLocal early voting started and I always like to emphasize this is going on in Arizona with our friend Martha McSally where they will cut what great congresswoman become senators she's urging people to go you want people to do early voting and there's a your Twitter feed has a link to it\nHow many Tennesseans typically do that and ... how are you tracking it pretty closely\nWe are going to be tracking it on following get of course yes we do want people to go or like we get an early vote platform almost said like why we were all over west technically yesterday\nAnd reaching out a meeting with ... making certain things that\nAre are\nFinding that they're showing up at their company that Fran\nBook they're remembering this is a very important place to marry and Kona and critical ... on and we need them to ... you never know I somebody could end up being on election day or a child me a car that had to make an unexpected trap so we're going to get that vote in the south\nThat's exactly right the last question the economy across the country a three point seven percent unemployment for point two percent growth that Alan Greenspan on yesterday he loves the animal spirits as he said that the president and the tax plan has unleashed is Tennessee even better than the national numbers\nYes we are better is on the national ... caused our fight against ... hottest state income tax here and have been shrinking I got them a sense I loved that spy on us in the early two thousand what he said this tendency now has\nThe fastest growing medium household income of any state in the southeast than\nWe are and the pop bottle nationwide and\nPeople know they're going to get wage growth and jobs are getting healthy economy and a like size and that kind of a tendency\nMarsha Blackburn always a pleasure congresswoman follower on Twitter a boat Marsha Marsha Blackburn dot com to contribute to in touch with her campaign and keep her in the field we absolutely need to win that race for two points up and we love that kind of news\nWe love that kind of news also up for people to remember alliance defending freedom has done great work in Tennessee in forty nine other states\nAlliance offending freedom is in fact just exactly what Marsha Blackburn is for winter\nTime they had been winning and winning and winning and winning and winning jak Billups masterpiece ... Stutzman in Washington state all they do is when we liked that because they are the largest um [noise]\nA legal defense from in the country and they provide free legal services the people that need it just this week another victory for individual rights thanks to our friends and allies have been put in the city of Atlanta has agreed to pay one point two million dollars to settle a lawsuit brought by ATF on behalf of former fire chief Calvin Cochrane\nDemocrats are saying President Trump calling stormy Davis horse face is going to reinvigorate never ... I don't believe so I didn't get done\nWell look I mean you know when I say that some things done we can find examples where\nThere's still some hold over but I really feel like\nThat was it tell right so like if you're never Trump or\nAnd new sided against confirming justice Kavanaugh it probably means that you are now\nA Democrat probably you know you you know across the river con\nAnd simultaneously I mean there are a lot of people that were never Trump or is it hated Donald Trump and now because of cap and all\nAre basically coming back home so look if anything ever really over probably not but I think that was a turning point and in fact it was the end of never Trump ism with in the conservative with in the Republican Party\nNow I did argue with um a good friend is a never Trump or instill whenever Trump or they're down to about sex that\nThis was before Justice Kennedy's retirement mad Louis I argued that if a if Justice Kennedy retired and they know their Gorsuch like judge were confirmed that would be dispositive the wisdom of having voted for Donald Trump\nAnd then ever temperature nowhere and then I'm just kind of stunned by that because of course apps and a counterfactual that\nJustice Kennedy wouldn't have retired to Supreme Court picks by Hillary Clinton would've launched the cord into an era of war and like\nThat would have made more in like activism
