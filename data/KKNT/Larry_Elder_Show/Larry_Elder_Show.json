[{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "Why do people in Canada pay forty percent less than the American he was a whole system so rich\nAnd there's an answered the big drug makers spend a lot of money lobbying to protect their profits over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars to be fair but there's a bigger lobby in America or politicians must answer too and that's us\nWe want solutions to prescription drug the price of portability you want them now it's time to hold drug makers accountable and put my patients ahead of profits but they have their lobbyists and there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories of oh let's do something about this uh [noise] my next guest\nIs the president and chief executive officer of research Institute that they San Francisco based think tank founded back in Nineteen Seventy nine please welcome back to the program [noise] Sally Sally how you doing [noise]\nDoing great I'm Sally Bernie Sanders wants to Medicare for all can you give us your analysis of what this would do\n[noise] yes it would be a complete disaster as if you know Larry I'm Canadian I grew up in Canada under a single payer\nI started a publication back in Nineteen eighty eight\nI'm I'm waiting your turn a guide to waiting lists the average Canadian family\nUm wait Twenty one point two weeks from thing a primary care doctor to getting treatment by specialist Bernie Sanders want the Canadian health care system that Medicare for all the time has come he wants the Canadian system but even more he wants to add vision care pre drugs\nAnd um and and an entry vision care\nAnd and um you know of course he he has a bill before the Senate which had sixteen co sponsors for them what to become president and of course he never talks about what it would cost and how it would be paid for but it's Charles ... center said thirty two trillion dollars over ten years all\nPrivate coverage under his plan Larry would be outlawed and you know a hundred and sixty million Americans have employer sponsored insurance and the polls show they like it they would lose their coverage immediately and we would all be\nLike people in the u._k. under the national health service Canada under Medicare system\nThe on waiting lists are care would be rationed and our taxes would have to be increased significantly\nSally how would why why does a Medicare for all seem to test so well among Democrats\n[noise] well I think you know Bernie started this back in twenty sixteen I'm Single payer has been around for Medicare for all for a long time but only in twenty sixteen when he was running against Hillary for the Democratic presidential nomination brought out his first single payer plan you know telling the American people that would be free and they would have the best healthcare and all\nAnd so you know the mainstream media picks up on this and plays it over and over again that you know who wouldn't want something that's free but as I say he never talked about how it would be paid for and how much it would cost and so and then he has of course is I'm a new young sidekick Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\n... member of the Democratic or social for the America she is going around with Bernie telling candidate you know promoting candidates who support single payer and so it's really a being a very big move to the left for the Democratic party and I think we're going to see in this midterm election on November six\nAre these candidates who are running to the left that Ben Jealous or for governor of Maryland this I'm Andrew Gillum who is running against um [noise] the Santa for the governorship in Florida how do these people do to the American people are they finally understanding by people like you and me tell educating them on\nHow terrible it would be what the costs to be their tax burden and you know in the latest poll um study out of the American association of medical colleges\nThey're predicting a shortage of a hundred and Twenty one thousand doctors\nBy twenty thirty because so many dogs at sixteen percent increase so many dogs you know quit medicine under Obamacare but the thought of being under a single payer system where Bernie says they would be paid for forty percent below\nWhat they're paid now um because they their salaries their payments would be tied to Medicare for this war and courage and more doctors to quit and the best and brightest young people not to go into medicine\nShall we talk to me about a pre existing conditions I thought it was an assault on the on the insurance model to force insurance carriers to take people with preexisting illnesses now hearing Republican say hey hey Democrats don't say that we're going to take away preexisting conditions because we're not I'm confused\nWell I Know it's very confusing and of course it's all goes back to the fact that when Trump was running as president and the Republicans were running in the twenty sixteen presidential they promised that they would repeal and replace Obamacare unfortunately you know by the early fall at twenty Seventeen they hadn't been able to do it and it wasn't done\nUm we're seeing some very good things being done through the administration secretary Alex aides are you know expanding I'm short term a limited to ration plans association help out a lot of things are happening\nBut this issue of preexisting conditions keeps coming up and the Republicans I think though that are in tight races are getting squishy on the issue the the point is that there are only about six\nThirty\nWho are in the individual market who are I'm going to have serious of chronic\nOr ... so so let me take a break right here and we come back you could finish your thought

armed American radio I mean I hear my mom you know\nAll we can you really talk about that subject for one hour every week oh my gosh\nSix days of radio and I don't have enough time and we've got so much to cover for you today\nAnd I was going to to go there with you immediately because I've got a great guess wind up Alan Gottlieb will be here momentarily followed by Rhonda ... from Chicago as can be great interview followed by a W. R. Hawkins from Breitbart News followed by a four hour with Dr John Lott\nWho I Know is frustrated and I I spoke with him today but I Can't wait to bring in the program today [noise] excuse me I bear with me I Am getting over a cold and I don't want to keep reaching back behind me to the board hitting mute so if you hear me every once in a clearing my throat bear with me I Do apologize\nBut I got I got to start the day off we start the hour off with you here today with this I got a phone call this morning\nFrom on my studio and I generally don't ever answer that phone I don't even know the number but it was ringing incessantly and continue doing so I decided I'd pick it up and tell a telemarketer where to go\nWhen I heard ... this is Mike ... LDC British radio how you did I and I am doing just fine Mike how are you he's just wondering if you might be able to join Kevin McGuire with us on the radio today\nIn about Fifteen minutes so I did and there is a big article that I just found the moments ago Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter now this guy you know anything about Kevin McGuire\nKevin ... is a longtime political a journalist pundits and radio hosts very well respected in England he's also so far left he's ready to fall off the planet\nThere is a clip here that's attached I Want you to take a listen to what I have to do is give you a theater of the mind\nBecause you can't see Kevin the clip is a video of him on the air with me he's letting me talk and the whole time he's rolling his eyes these huffing and puffing his shirts coming off he's wrong on his shoulders back\n[laughter] and after about eight to ten minutes of being on the air with him and my complete thorough utter destruction of him I Want to read you a quote from the bottom from one of the readers of this piece of take a listen to see how I did hear how they do\nSee if I can get the pop up here I Hope I can hear we cannot do it I might not be able to do it well we'll have to maybe pulled it up in the later segment here or maybe in the end and understand what you might give me one more shot on this I just pulled the ... minutes ago so it's possible I might not be able to get a Toronto but we're going to try it again\nA background check looks at the background it doesn't look forward Kevin and that's the problem that we have these people I I can list thirty mass shooters in America who passed background checks we want we want to the problem is there are guns in American as Paul said if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun\nCan in America and it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very very complex issue as I said there are hundreds of millions of firearms in this country now your response was banned assault weapons well first of all I bought my first a are Fifteen during the Clinton assault weapons ban there are\nTens of millions of these guns in America that aren't going anywhere so it's wishful thinking it's easy to be a jerk reactions say my God we have to band is in reality that's not going to work\nBecause they can't be bad they are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their lawfully own firearms who have done nothing wrong with their firearms fast majority of this complex and it's frustrating and I feel your frustration as an American we hate to see those were the ones that will just stop\nWell we don't care for people murdering people it's insane\nThe fifth of Americans with guns or intimidating look the full fifth not do not I don't know I don't want your phone or any more I don't want your thoughts and prayers any more than ...\nNow he went ahead and got does what liberals do he lost the argument he got very ... me and he cut off my Mike now\nWas an excuse me it was an awful lot of fun but I Want you to take a listen to a comment at the bottom of the article and then we're going to go to my first guest and this was promoting Martin Palmer's to know the interview was longer than that one minute and forty second clip but\nHe was completely utterly destroyed this Kevin ... loose Kevin Maguire is an MBA so in a ... one of the ... the American was polite courteous and gracious throughout you have to present or got so angry after thoroughly losing the argument that he swam down the phone and went into a tirade behind his back\nSo apparently after he hung up on me\nHe went off on me on the air and that's fine I couldn't care less what losers do\nIt made me ashamed to be from the same country I'm disgusted by this presenter by the way what on earth as American gun laws have to do with us here in the u._k. shouldn't we just bought out it isn't like the u._k. is such a fantastic place crime is through the roof and there were more murders in London last year the New York let me go\nDirectly to Alan Gottlieb founder of the second amendment foundation and have some fun with this as we move into other topics with you today Alan how're you\nSign mark that sound like a ... outside of the little little exchange there\nWas a lot of fun and for somebody like you who has a has a lot of experience and you know people coming after you and you know these interviews are going to be set up I've I've been on with with um with Kevin in the past so I knew what was coming we know it was interesting how he before he interviewed me\nHe interviewed a gentleman by the name of Paul with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette who absolutely nailed and said essentially kind of what I said\nBut he talked about more of the complexities of the issue he went deeper into why it's impossible why gun control laws don't work et cetera Kevin McGuire never set a thing to him never questioned him when he came after me because he's had me on before and he knows I'm armed American radio and not a journalist with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nSo he you know he tried to attack me when he got put in place and I thought the comment from the uh from the reader of the article in Britain today was wonderful and uh I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nWell I think he did a marvelous job uh unfortunately you're not going to change his mind or probably a significant amount of his viewers because his viewers of people just like him otherwise they wouldn't be viewing a\nBut he did a very good job and you know that's the expected ... getting at at a a left wing person from getting\nA delight people control I mean they like to control people it's just a problem is in Britain\nThey don't get to control the criminals that he wants a running wild [laughter] [noise]\nYeah and they were the he doesn't like to talk about crime in Britain and so forth but now Piers Morgan put a tweet out the other day too I found this fascinating Pittsburgh shooters reporter to using they are Fifteen in the preferred weapon of choice for most mass shooters in America Sandy Hook Vegas et cetera and John Lott will be here later to tell us that that's not true\nBecause they kill lots of people very fast this is what they look like Louis Post a photograph of us will people scary or Fifteen and he says I ask again why the ... are these legal for civilians and my reply was quite simple\nBecause tens of millions of responsibly armed Americans use them safely responsibly every single day\nNow how much of this argument now are we going to start seeing because of Pittsburgh I Want your thoughts now on how you think this whole thing is going to build up over the coming days and weeks ... by the mid term\nWell before I answer that I'd like to point out that this particular murderer than just having a are you also have handguns with them as well [noise]\nUh and we don't know what what what kind of see actually used to do all the firing of how they throw it was quite bullets torch guns so when they go like to pick on the assault weapons you know if you're banned assault weapons has got to walk into an unarmed unprotected you know in synagogue\nOur nobody had a firearm to protect themselves because of their country policy uh and if he didn't use the R I could eat it probably did uses handguns anyway\nSo the problem here is is that none of this works and they just don't want to admit to it now and answering your question how it's going to play out there's no doubt that he pulled his gun rights ... they can try and spin it you know the evil of guns ...\nAh there's just there's two ways about it I'm not sure anybody could begin to buy it because I think the American people just play ... recognized attack if this was a hate crime I can committed against people of religion\nOr that took a crazy crazy person to do this that was a you know obviously murder that have a A R R as ... as you could walk in with a pipe\nBomb as well and and kill more people so the problem here is is that it isn't about guns and at the American people get it so I'm not too concerned about how this can impact the trauma lectures\nI've I'm with you on that in fact I'm with you on that a hundred and ten percent at some things you can feel in your gut listener union I Know you know this you get that gut feeling I I'm not getting that gut feeling I've learned over many years in business and\nAnd just doing this that you you learn to trust your gut my gut instinct is generally always right at least ... percent of the time now and I'm I'm kind of feeling the same thing you know I like to point out that people would have\nHad I had the opportunity before he not hung up on me because he was destroyed and couldn't argue with me any more but\nIt's the fact that for example when we show in Virginia Tech used a glock Nineteen and a twenty two to murder thirty two people and they don't want to hear that because they're okay with handguns than when you hit him with that they really get mad and pick their toys that a little while and like you know they're getting\nI Wish we had the money to compete and I feel that same about winning I I'm hoping ugly actually is can be strong enough to not not Taylor ballot measure but if we don't win is a political putting its dollars it bought the election\nWhat concerns me about that I agree with you on that statement I'm not real I wasn't that statement concern me somewhat as I mentioned but here's really\nBecause I didn't I don't want it to create complacency I think statement like that can create some apathy on our side with what we've got the grassroots look what the interests that they're not really worried about it my five boxes enough\nOr well I I just I'll just renew my membership next year and not worry about ... that's what concerns me about that and I know the wants to keep that happy face on we all do but there comes a time when you got to say look guys\nOkay these people out spend enough now three to one and we need to get off our duff we've got to get active yes we have grass roots but we need assistance here let's go now to sixteen thirty nine you covered enough of it but I just want to ask you one question as we're coming up to this ballot initiative\nThat six hundred thousand I'm just going to say this from what I just heard you say\nYou felt better last week and you did this week is that a fair statement\n[noise] oh yeah that that money to compete with that certainly thousand dollars that I feel as good as they get last week\nI don't feel it within the last minute money coming in from three big donors schoolwork being one of those\nAnd you know one of the problems we have is he going to put a good spin on everything but you sometimes can't believe you're on the letter Rick uh and sometimes it it it's better to let people know who they are the battle you know I always say that are actually won election away from extinction and it's really true\nIt absolutely is true and it's true every single election cycle it every single election cycle All right let me move to another topic with your quick we've got just a couple of minutes s a F joins California group suing riverside county sheriff overseas cw policies this is not the first rodeo with the second amendment foundation supporting the rights\nA legal American resident tell us about this one real quick\nListen to share this decided because California this is ... she says carriers get discretion of what they want to do you say that if you're a legal you know residents who are on hold again you know in in the Sacramento a lo and behold you you you can't\nYou know and wherever I can I should say you you can't get a permit to carry it for self protection or we once it gets all across the country well when your students well a and the sheriff or he pretends to be pro gun but he he hardly get permits out in ... in this county and he's even kept reelection battle right now\nSo let's go probably happening you eat good chance to lose the election and the new chef coming in will move to suit for us and we'll win or because those are issues permits or we'll go to ... for the court battle and lobster and the court overturned it\nSheriff Stanley Smith a sniff is actually pro gun he's pro his gun\nHe's just not pro your gun hopefully all of

being invited to take part in\nDebate with time magazine and with time magazine you know it was a a big\nIt was a gun debate about guns in America and I want to thank band Mahler my D.C projects sisters who took part in this time ... magazine project as representing themselves as a gun owners they had the opportunity to kill their personal stories\nThey told they found the hearts they had the ... the passion didn't go there not knowing if they were going to be well chef they\nAccept it but nevertheless it was a grant a project they did well they did great and for all the people that went there to represent\nScholarship or the the secular left side of things because how often do you get\nTo kill your personal story what happened in your life and how it happened and have sought to portray it in a more rural or led on the front page of time magazine and I think that's used for us that were invited that we're able to go out and partake in this because nationally\nGun ownership in America don't often get to see the positive side of things you know what I'm saying\nSo ... that was that was huge I'm Glad you brought that up because I'm going to be talking about that time mural cover in the next hour with their W. R. Hawkins also but let me point out to listeners what what it is round is talking about what you said mural\nThe cover of time it's actually a piece of art done by Jay are the artist and what they did was they pieced together two hundred and fifty four people from all sides\nOf the gun debate all sides everybody from Shannon watch all the way over to the ...\nAnd are good for even get to ask you on this thing and when you have her over the digital version their silhouette pops up and you can click on it and actually listen to their story it is quite fascinating now I'm going to have to go through as you know probably ... can get all the ... two hundred and fifty four of 'em and I will\nYou know and if it's going to be it's going to be quite the project but I thank you for bringing that up now we got about ... but\nNo I just wanted to get out of there because you know if it was a great thing and it spread that gun owners or to a supportive to get a positive energy that they got from this because those women and the oatmeal with their input their heart out you know they told their personal stories\nAnd and they don't get hurt as often so you know big up to that because we in two thousand and I think D.C project will be back in Washington DC so I'll get to tell you more about that later\nYeah and you know the fun part about the time thing was a lot of people that you've never heard of before it wasn't everybody that you see or hear like me on radio and everything else it was a lot of regular people out there\nThat are telling these stories again from both sides and it it's quite fascinating I'm looking forward to going through the whole thing rounded with about another we've got about another minute Chicago guns matter the ... the website it's great it's Chicago guns mattered dot org\nYour pictures up there and it talks a little bit about you so I Want to encourage listeners to make sure to go over and check out Chicago guns matter dot org and you're going to find out a whole bunch about what it is we're talking about here today know round it did you do we don't want to miss anything did you have anything else you wanted to cover with the next minute before we have to fly\nShould let me call is very\n\nCross marine officers duty you know [laughter]\nOr American radio now the white hair arm because the last woman I get here and we're making the second amendment by hand a very strong supporter of the second amendment\nInforming hand Andrew training responsibly arm citizens from coast to coast here is your host of armed American radio\nBar called her\nTo armed American radio [noise]\nThis is a this show is flying right along I'll tell you if this hour's anywhere near like the last hour the segments were just flying by so I Want you to make sure you buckle and okay going to be an awful lot\nAn awful lot of content being covered we're going to move very quickly said I Want to read a comment oh first time we start with this kind of as I open up the previous hour in case you missed it I'll start with this I did a\nNational radio program in Great Britain today it's it's not that I Do a lot of those on the BBC and and the international interviews after something like this happens they kind of reach out to me on that have been very friendly to them over the number of years so and I certainly don't mind doing it I Love talking to the British people most of them feel exactly the way you do\nIt's just they're elite smuggling is at the top\nThat doesn't they just simply don't understand Americans freedoms and you're not going to convince them otherwise but it's fun to go round and round with him especially when you know you're gonna get ambushed\nParticularly because you've been on with this particular host before in the past but uh the article after my appearance on the show is titled it made I guess pressure that on the LDC leaving leaving Britain's conversation\nKevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter now see day in light of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Kevin McGuire spoke with mark Walters passionate supporter of gun rights and host of armed American radio to get his view on gun laws and your mark seemed adamant that stricter background checks\nWouldn't help the situation\nAs quoting me a background check looks at the background it doesn't look forward mark pointed out that he could name thirty mass shooters in America who had all pass background checks quoting the again if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun he can in America it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very complex issue mark and mark went on to claim\nThat a ban on assault weapons is not realistic and even claimed that he bought his first day our during the Clinton assault weapons ban which is true\n[noise] it's easy to knee jerk reaction and say my God we have to band is in reality that's not going to work because they can't be bad they are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their firearms who have done nothing wrong and that's the vast majority of Americans I said as an American gun owner we hate to see this were the ones that want this to stop\nHe claimed however at this point Kevin seemed to lose his patients referring to gun supporters who have recently spoken out in defense of gun laws in the U. S. Kevin responded that the Americans with students are intimidating the pool if they do not\nKevin ended the discussion by telling mark oh I don't want your thoughts and prayers anymore then he hung up on me\nThey didn't say that and then he hung up on the end of the interview and apparently unbeknownst to me went off behind my back which is proof positive that you won the argument because these guys can't stay in the kitchen they like to go to the sandbox they they can't play with the big Bush\nSo the videos on there if you want to go see it I just Google that will be see\nKevin McGuire clashes with us gun rights supporter and take a look at it I put it out on my Twitter page if you want to see it at a A R mark at a A R mark what's funnier than anything is to come down below\nFrom Martin Palmer stuff who says this cabin isn't in Brazil and rude ignorant one is that the American was polite courteous and gracious throughout you have to present or got so angry after thoroughly losing the argument that he slammed down the phone and went into a tirade behind his back\nIt made me ashamed to be from the same country I Am disgusted by this presenter\nBy the way what on earth does American gun laws have to do with us here in the u._k. shouldn't we just bought out it is it like the u._k. is such a fantastic place crime is through the roof and there were more murders in London last year than in New York so\nI I enjoy reading that because I just thought before we went on air and I think it makes for great fodder to open up this discussion right now with a W are Hawkins from Breitbart News\nWho I think will agree with me and some of the things I said you can actually listen to a minute and forty two seconds it was much like your interview but he was thoroughly crushed eight of you are welcome to the show my friend so did I say anything in there that ah that you felt was\nUntrue by background checks are assault weapons or bans are confiscation or anything like that\nNo you're right you're basically stated commonsense position and uh just the truth and uh that's it they can't handle it that's the bottom line I just can't handle it\nThey're not open not only they wanted originally from about but the whole level they're not open to the fact that there will do that\nAnd it's not just as individual not talking about Brits were talking about every every left the the things the way he does this guy's got classic American leftist socialism disease a truly does\nA and it's it it was fascinating I I've I've clashed with the guy before and I hope to do so again I appreciate them having me on the show it's an awful lot of fun and I like when they get so angry that they can't argue anymore you know they just they get so flustered that they have to hang up the phone and and then you know talk about you behind your back because they can't win the argument\nOn the merits now let's go to Pittsburgh for a minute or two or three or four or five or however many want to cover a W are\nWhat went through your head when you saw this as someone who covers this every single day and winds awards for doing so what went through your head when you first saw the news on Pittsburgh\nImmediately a like a ... or do what the question was going free [noise]\nAnd uh so it's prime target you know you get a lotta people congregate it in a place where you at a school workplace church where there's no armed protection\nAnd uh you gotta have ... I think they said he was in charge for twenty minutes I'm correct [noise] uh that that you know um [noise] that was the first thing that went through my mind and I'd say the next thing we're just goofy horrible for the family\nBut you know the last talks all the time but how they get tired of the stores are getting tired of this happening in six less gun violence or the or else they say I get tired of it happening too I get tired of law abiding Americans living\nTheir lives in areas where there's there's no there's no good guy with a gun and uh that's what has changed in my opinion that's what that's what was on the on line at the end of the day at the end of the day I look back on what Trump said which I covered\nAnd then I thought he did remarkable you know he did that we really did it he said I Wish we had our security there and he said also on speed up the death penalty so that will people do these kind of thing they know they're going to die and they're going to die quick and I think I think I think those are the two logical approaches to this from this point\nIf you don't do a place where there's not a good guy with a gun don't be the good guy without a gonna go to like make sure you're in a place for their own protection and due call your Sanders representatives let's get some laws change\nSo that people do it to the liberty of living on death row for years and years once they're found guilty\nAnd they have their appeal that's it kill them there's no reason for taxpayers have to find some art or his life and that's what a life sentence ends up being\nAt California you're listening in a number of studies right now you're listening in Sacramento right there in your state capital and you're listening in Southern California you're listening in the bay area my gosh you eat a death sentence in California is nothing but mere show which is simply window dressing\nAnd you're paying for it you're paying for that\nAnd I I don't know that it even bothers people out there anymore I really truly don't but it's interesting because I can use this as a Segway now to your first piece that I wanted to talk with you about today perfect just works just amazing how we're able to do that on this program Chris Murphy mocks Trump for wanting armed security in places of worship Chris Murphy\nChris Murphy is a gun hating ballot lunatic left his socialist from Connecticut\nMarks ... for wanting armed security in places of worship go ahead and take it away before we have to go to the break\nTold me that sets it you know and they tried to be ominous he said Trump on ... and he said he won't semi automatic ... a gunman with semi automatic rifles in every school and rest Scott and go to Tom does want any such thing\nNow but he used the phrase semi automatic rifles just to be like ooh and make a sham scary but guess what\nIf you had had an army officer in the synagogue with a semi automatic rifle\nHow grateful would we be right now because we'd had eleven people here with us that are going on and who would be dead but one animal that deserve to die but managed to live through it and that's why uh the little semi automatic trades doesn't bother me at all in my truck for warning warning on protection for innocence\nBut that's not going to be a sign will be a winning ... Democrats so out they'll keep pushing it\nI Hope they do too and we'll all kind of throw in my little exclamation point on this as we head into this breaking W. R. because apparently Senator Chris Murphy has no problem with armed protection for himself and his colleagues on Capitol Hill\nAnd uh you know again I Am not trying to say that police officer did that but uh this is where we are society you know people use the wrong terminology\nYeah and I guess we're all guilty of it from time to time I you know I had the interview with the dopey McGuire over there and I can't comment dopey guy you know he's entitled to his opinion and we have fought on the radio we go back and forth and we don't like each other and that's what makes it fun so\nBut you know I I catch myself to you know it's impossible not gonna sit here and try to correct the guy on the phrase out due the terminology when I've got four minutes on a radio interview because then it turns into a Piers Morgan type deal\nAnd it just disintegration I Want people to hear what we're trying to say and but you know I Know somebody out there right now is screaming at me W. R. if it's not an assault rifle make sure you call it that and we do we attempt to do that all the time sometimes there are even bigger points that we have to get out without turning the argument away which is what sometimes that would do\nAll right you know what let's move on from Chris Murphy he's just as out in the lunatic\nAnd he's a hypocrite and he's also very very dishonest man is what he is\nBut we already talked about you have another piece law enforcement synagogue attacker legally owned his guns I think this is important for one reason because doesn't that go that headline alone says it all I W are and that's what goes to the heart of why we have a right to defend ourselves because we understand the evil exist evil\nChooses the time and place to become evil not ... and we have a right to defend ourselves from it because we are powerless to even identify it aren't we\n[laughter] true true but you know there's there's something I'm trying to call them trying to turn as hard as\nI think what I write ... I Know what I Do I write news but also on in my heart to educate people and and there's a corner I'm trying to turn where I can somehow get people to think about\nThe fact that there is no substitute for freedom I'm not trying to be profound uh it's very simple gun control is not an apple substitute for freedom and if you think it is\nAnd he didn't pay attention Saturday or you didn't pay attention to park on\nOr you didn't pay attention to Santa Fe high school a cake twenty eight pain or he didn't pay attention at the church in Texas November fifth twenty Seventeen I keep going but a gun control is not\nA valid substitute for freedom because gun control priest poses that if we limit everybody's freedoms\nAnd certain crimes won't go away it does not work that way what happens is when you limit my ability to exercise my God given rights you put me in an unnatural position\nOr had been a member of the congregation on Saturday I would've come under fire and the senseless and somehow we have to realize that us that we can't do it every time we embrace gun control where we need to or not we're saying that's a good substitute for freedom folks there is no\nGood substitute for freedom there is not one that works\nAnd that's why a framer went out of their way to hit you in the second ...\nWell said I'm not even gonna stop that is the exclamation point on that a perfect place to take a break you know I I got to say this on another note that when it comes to\nArming oh my God we wouldn't Trump wants to armed guards who we are guards in bank we armed guards in government buildings\nHell is the problem with defending\nWhere we gather that are targeted by evil [noise]\nDon't know the odds you give them possible to get into their head and it's hard to wrap your head around it back W.

M. C. D. armed text it to eight seven to two two and again PSA here for you don't do it while you're driving smarter than that that's why you listen to the show a W are ... let's go to\nWhat you wrote about a student's bill of rights\nFor state for communities I've read this in in its entirety I'm going to go through each one with you this is the stupidest thing I think I've ever seen in my life and what it is it's just a bunch of people getting together to put something on paper and feel like they did something I Can't think of any other reason for this can you\nKnow no it's it's a you could tell was written about kids it's ignorant\nEstablish a school safety committee whose meetings are open to the public at every school equally\nCompose the student's parents than faculty so ... safety committee I don't know what that means they don't tell us to provide immediate access to qualified counselors and safe spaces so good lord\nFor students of all demographics at all levels of education off case you didn't realize that this was coming from the left do big left hooks all you had to do is look at safe spaces was that a giveaway to you too\nRight yeah well I mean this is laughable it gets worse so that's the worst\nPart it does go here encourage all school personnel to foster positive relationships at all levels of education in okay provide professional development around mental health awareness and interventions were students parents than faculty provide professional development around mental health awareness I don't know what that means to you by chance\nYou know I ... I don't think they do either\nOkay but it sounded kind of important the way it was written\nNumber ... require cultural competency require caught and it wasn't as careful require cultural competency and be asked elation trainings each quarter for law enforcement provided by the local police department in conjunction with equity training organization and companies\nA boy you want to tackle that one\nWas just stupid it's more of the list and what the left doing the police the bad guys they're the ones they learn how to be asked the escalate no this I rarely do I see a police video I think that also got messed up normally you see a police video they tell the guy put your hands up\nStay still don't ... the guy who's he stands up puts his hands his pockets reach for something to get shot\nAt just how that works like a ... if you're that ignorant a bit and you know should just you shouldn't be in a car driving her animals you may have a chance to get you an officer 'cause you ... to ... to to talk to him so yeah this makes police look like they're the calls the problem and that's a clock classical left his position\nIt certainly is and it was a give away with cultural competency that was the give away right there before the rest of that or whatever it did [noise] excuse me as I fight the cold I Apologize right now\nIn the ... one of the things they're cultural competency see they don't since they're left is they're not capable than I thought a but if they were they'd have to realize that whose culture do\nYou have to be competent in they didn't find that because it does that mean but cultural competence a competency in the culture that we see in Saudi Arabia where only look we can go out or is it the culture in another Middle East company\nCountry where women have to be completely covered only their eyes could show is that going to be competent in or do we need to be competent in a culture where they they don't love their neighbors but the Lakers I mean which culture are they talking about see they want to because they want to be multi cultural embrace everybody so who decides which culture camp that's another mess in the city\nIt is and it's a great question to ask and one that they won't have an answer to if you were to ask them that no one asked them that in the meeting where they discussed this nobody brought that up that's why it's there but you know something\nElse I Want to point out about these police officers too that maybe these kids might want to think about and that is sometimes like happened here in the state of Georgia last week sometimes officers simply approach a vehicle and get shot and killed\nAs they're approaching the vehicle sometimes that happens sometimes at Georgia State highway patrol officer pulls a vehicle over on interstate Seventy five and gets shot at\nIn this case had an opportunity to fire back sometimes officers are murdered in the line of duty before they even have an opportunity to say Hi how are you today the reason I'm stopping you is wake up children wait but hell\nUp number six implement\nEquitable funding to traditionally under resourced schools specifically allocated

written by kids the treatment I shouldn't have said that some kids are Nick but these kids are the kids who wrote this\nYou can tell that they've been educated about people who just pass them for one class to another because they don't even know how to use the language\nAnd done it in a left wing faction and fed them a left wing ideals\nAre reduced to go back to the velocity around I I had a\nWalking to the dentist for your show\nComing to you from uh [noise]\nThe twin cities in Minnesota\nThink specifically in Minneapolis I don't think I Would say pull those St Paul yesterday in Minneapolis today I Am so fair minded [noise]\nThat I Do that when I come to the twin cities I take care of each twin\nWe have a truly remarkable evening last night about him I was about seven hundred

[noise] I Wish there was an evening that I I I Wish every left wing or in the country could have seen what what\nHow we talk just amongst ourselves and the civility of it and the lack of a tribute it would be fascinating to contrast that with a similar evening of people on the left to an audience on the left but\nI don't know how I Would do it but I Would like to talk to about a little more later 'cause I Want to talk a little bit about the last question I was asked put it in the meantime they have found a suspect\nOr they have arrested a suspect in me and to use the\nOther even know what to call that will be real bombs whatever they were sent to all these people on the left and that so far it looks like it looks like a man is a a a coup God in the right\nAnd uh he has a a they have his vantage ban is\nPlastered with Donald Trump stickers and the like so we will ah let's see we have even more information just coming in now he's in his fifties\nAnd let's see what else we can say a rest made in connection with male explosive devices white van outside plantation auto zone appears to be focused over investigators and if you get the pictures of it or you\nCan see the the the pro Donald Trump\nStickers and people look if it's conceivable the guys on the left that he wants to make believe these all the right but I suspect that this is the real deal he's simply a he was already it's interesting he'd already been arrested in the past he has a record for making terror threats\nWhy people who make terror threats are not in jail is one of my\nRiddles I don't understand that ... they have to actually acted out [noise]\nYou can't threaten death terror and the like and that would be sufficient to place you are in prison I I don't know I'm a I'm just a question that I'd posing [noise]\nSo what is going to happen and it's already happening is you see we told you it's a Trump rhetoric that cause the Trump rhetoric that caused the truck prior to Donald Trump to the left and the right got along great\nSo left was not calling a ... all of us all of us all of us racist and all I I'm not ... they were not calling the police a racist and even on occasion pigs this none of this was happening\nGuy who pay portrays the police's pigs on his socks in a in a a football game in a is a chosen by Nike to be spokesman ... this is all this is all because of Trump presumably\nA windmill Charles Murray uh one of the most thoughtful up people in the country or it goes to speak at Middlebury College and or is it physically attacked the ... and a woman ... professor with him he's injured by left wing students now that's all Trump She ... this is the amazing thing\nOnly only the rights views hate is is the lie to one of the grand ... because they have to do that for myself the grandest of the laws\nThe greatest of the law is is that America is racist will be the other number one is that we were Nazis right I mean come on\n... and ... you remember how fast the steam Scalia and the of the shooting at at a Republican congressman putting a baseball game or how fast that disappear\nFrom the news I mean you get updates on Steve's squeezes a condition and that would be it\n\nBut now this thing uh right right it before the elections I mean this guy aside from just being ... evil in his in sick is stupid stupid\nIt would be if if if the left could have it invented the guy they would have invented the guy if he turns out to be the right wing or that it that it apparently he as I say apparently\nBecause of the of the fan but as soon as I heard ... ... ... ... in the beginning I thought this could this could well be a guy on the left because it's so often these hoaxes to take place\nBut that's more information came into my thought about a moron I realized who the targets for it's hard for me to imagine these these were the ideal targets of somebody who does have people on the left I don't know if the people on the left would have picked the same targets if they were trying to blame the right\nWill find out more and I will let you know any more information as it is revealed to the public of the United states of America [noise] so I have a very interesting thing for you here very interesting\nToday uh let's see David Brooks in the New York times who ... the the New York times has three columnist author of about twenty\nThat are knocked on the left and David Brooks is one of them\nThere were none that are on the right\nThere are non leftists which is fine but they're they're not really on the right I never words I don't I don't believe I Know for a fact there was not a single pro Trump columnist of the twenty twenty five coalition of the New York times not one\nHalf the country is pro Trump and not a single columnist they could not find a human being in the ... I take that back of course they could find a human being they would not publish a human being who was pro Trump on the opinion page\nOr on the New York times of the New York times so but David Brooks is not is not on the left and he was just the average age of centrist but I mean he's quite anti Trump but he wrote a piece in which he spoke about how beautiful nationalism is that he is a nationalist there's not a global ...\nWhich in the New York times that gutsy thing to do of course he spoke about how Donald Trump\nIs probably a good nationalist either because otherwise he would be kind of acceptable to the New York Times' readership defeated also attack\nDonald Trump I'm not saying about sincere that I'm fairly telling you that that's what happened\nBut the article the column was a pro nationalism pieces you I remember I spent some time on that it's very important the president said he's a mashable list any attack the global lists and he was laughed at CNN and I played the laughter I mean they actually laughed at it\nSo now I what I find even more interesting than the columns or the comments by readers so I Want to retrieve some of the comments of New York times readers to New York times\nColumn ... the virtues of nationalism and what she says I Love my nation you know and it's a good thing to love your nation and my you know I I feel more for my nation than I Do for another nation just as I feel more for my family that a number of family\n\nAnd I want other nations to love their nation right all of which I Am said very often myself so listen to some of the some of the letters that are written and again I'll give you updates are with regard to um anything in Florida here with the suspect on the bombing\nSo here number one ... this is talk of the times\nPicks a half times picks there were three are\nThere are three ah lists that the word three lists of comments that New York times picked list the readers picked list and all so this is the times pick\nThat sounds like patriotism to me and there's a difference nationalism is historically been used to know the superiority of the nation to the detriment of other nations in the world community nationalism as arrogance and false pride\nShow I Am about this this has nothing to do with the bobber I Want to ask a question about Megan Kelly [noise] so I keep reading how she's a racist and she's a racist and she's a racist and she may be raised I I I don't know\nHer I I don't particularly care for her but I Do have a great care for truth so it'd be a one of the big examples biggest constant examples is that she said that Santa Claus is white\n\nNow let me say for the record that I Love seeing black Santa clauses and Asian Santa Claus is I Love it I think it I think that is truly the spirit of Christmas\nTo see a the idea of at Santa Claus can only be why that would be that would be racist I think [noise]\nBut eve Santa Claus the ... the legend of Santa Claus coming from Europe and coming and and the you know for kids another disease from the north pole the people in the north\nWell I guess really north I guess you might be more of a number of me think of it a an Eskimo\nBut anyway it's an ... it's an odd that charge is that if if if you hang your hat on she said Santa Claus is white\nAh [noise]\nIt doesn't strike me that that is evidence that the person thinks that blacks should be mistreated\nOr that they are inherently inferior in some way I Would tell me I'm very I really am curious 'cause I I'm not I'm not up on my or triggers here\nNow that's an interesting thing just said to me by Sean so this is joy bay are dressed as a a beautiful\nAfrican woman for Halloween this is from twenty sixteen\nOr I look I I don't know the rules are very complex I got to tell you as you know the University of California has a\nBig list of micro aggressions thing that you could things you can say fat\nReveal that you're a racist I mean you are racist if you say you you don't do the only race you think exists as the human race\nThat actually that actually man and one or the other thing I think you though ... thank you for working that hard and moves me it ... me that they're showing his working that hard\nAll right anyway any any more news on all of that or I Will ah will bring it through attention won a Prager seven seven six or our lines are working today is everybody checked on the lines\nWere good All right [noise] but I I Will get back because\nYou have no idea how revealing it is [noise]\nHow much the word nationalism\nRankles people on the left [noise] and you

diabolical go ahead\nAnd saw on that and that and he saw an end socks you saw a lot of right wing propaganda on that has that drowning\nPropaganda if you think CNN sucks right wing ... you see what they give you they just keep at it day in and day out go ahead\nAnd come back on the president to say something you know sign but also some nice says\nSomething unifying and he was immediately mocked by your ilk\nYou having given this guy a break since the day he announced his presidency to run for president\nYou having given them a break at all given mocking I'm trying to humiliate him trying to smear him going after his taxes going after his wives ex wives his wife going after his kids don't after his businesses digging up whatever the hell you can you never treated Obama this way\nAnd you won't treat any Democrat this way go ahead\nDecide about the political uh of of of this has to say that we got to tone it down we got to come together and here she is\nA bleeding heart left wing hack stealing burping up her poison talking about we have to tone it down\n\nIt's just incredible now I'm not going to keep playing that because it's like waterboarding I'm not going to do that to your dinner time but now here's Dana Bash she supposed to be a reporter right\nOn CNN Today cut ten go\nThere's teleprompter Trump and there's Twitter Trump and that was teleprompter Trump\nOr something that was written very carefully very well by\nThe way there's teleprompter Dana Bash Anders non teleprompter Dana Bash go ahead\nAnd you know presented lay him to doing what he should do I think that as president talking about the black that violence is is never okay [noise] um\nThe problem is what he didn't say either oh in that teleprompter space yeah or unfair which is\nWe all need to lower the rhetoric 'cuse me he said that but what you didn't like is he also told you to lower\n\n... go ahead\nBecause I as president of the big impact on people and what I say and they have an impact us as everybody else has\nBernie Sanders has an impact\nJust as the uh the nut job in Utah who sent the rice and packages and others when Democrats speak they have an impact on the media speak they have an impact\n\nNothing that Donald Trump said resulted in a rice and being sent to a Susan Collins or General Mattis was ahead of our navy but his kid sort of Trump himself right\nWho's responsible for that Maxine Waters who seriously Chuck Schumer\nAdam Schiff who's responsible for that\nDana Bash go ahead\nFully man with a loud megaphone and the most Twitter followers and politics and that was a big omission\nNow this was a reporter ladies and gentleman who is giving her opinion endlessly and that's part of the problem in this country\nThere are people who give opinions people like me like Sean like rush like Carlson like getting ready to go down to less and there are people who are supposed to be straight news people not interpreting the news like giving their opinion on the news not question just given those does that sound like Dana Bash\nShe sounds like Jen how Mary I'm mouthpiece for Iraq no house Benita Obama\nDiet\nHave not seen him feeling that blank and ... anything as you mentioned he's on the other way\n... go ahead go ahead\nAnd continue to do animosity towards media\nNot stoking animosity towards the media keep using the phrase all over you bobble heads to your\nStoking animosity towards the media because you're dishonest you're intellectually dishonest\nOh you're a liberal Dana Bash you know John Harris your former husband you know he's a liberal you know Don Lemon as radical cool do you know what you know Jeff Zucker is a liberal who hates Trump you on that phony network know who you are you know what you're doing\nAnd then you have these comments to make wow this animosity toward us of course he has animosity toward you as do millions of people and we think for ourselves it's not like the president's taxes fingers and all of a sudden hey chicken which CNN that's not it\nI play your Monica statements eight and a half million people on the restaurant radio here you know the\nFive million people here are you on my part gas we hear you we know what you're saying we're thinking smart American people not what you think we are\nI'll give you another example\nOn this kind of an issue that is the invasion listen the Joe Scarborough today on MSNBC cut fourteen go\nWe will not be in his fry did from the fruit out there [noise] been around people are coming\nTo invade America [noise] uh this is all about [noise] public and on and talking about the fact [noise]\nGod in Naples healthcare [noise]\nAnd they don't want to have to face with or without it so it was all about this or you know how in St James ... is the word I'm looking at\nThings actually what's happening except now Republicans are doing it this\nGuy this guy really is a mental image you\nLook at the brown people the brown people\nWe want to enforce our laws and you see it's about the brown people\n\nJoe Scarborough the White House man on TV next to Chris Matthews\nIt's about the brown people really when Shelby Steele was one of my uh Fox show several months ago life liberty and live and he pointed out the guise of talk this way\nThey feel like they immunize themselves from criticism that they're better than all of you and so they can position themselves you see is supporting brown people\nBy you folks out there who aren't brown you obviously have brown people because you don't agree with Joe\nThis is a sick mindset and they want to talk about put it in the fuel and the fire when they constantly push this racist narrative constantly\nThey're not upset with their own rhetoric I get a caller from Aleppo complaining about antifa it as a violent left wing militia group a Marxist militia group\nAnd we in individuals on CNN like Don Lemon people on MSNBC who downplayed the violence they trust\nI mean they come armed\n\nExcuses are made for them But Trump's rhetoric you see is what's pushing that country over the edge\n\nOne of the biggest almost in human history is Adolf Hitler they call they call American citizens who voted for him Nazis racists\nBut at the Trump you see\nIf the left and the Democrats and the media had accepted the results of this last election twenty sixteen\nCriticized the president of course but try to destroy him come up with the Russian conspiracy theories act like they're the national Enquirer with every allegation\nTry and force him from office talk about his mental illness and on and on and on\nIf they accepted his legitimacy as president and criticized his policies or what he would say that's one thing but that's not what's going on in this country that's not what's going on in this country and we all know it doesn't\nCall your little whiny asked me if I asked my Trump said that he had no idea who asked Lopez Rivera was\nNothing and you don't give a damn you didn't care about bill airs you didn't care about pretty darn college another one you don't care about any up\n\nIncredible really incredible really and what exactly has Trump said\nThat would cause somebody to try and blow up twelve other people or threatened while other people\nWhat does he said he said punch somebody in the ... oh so when Obama said get in the face when holder said get them when they're down and I go on and on and on that sparked some Republican\nNo\nOne Bernie Sanders goes on and on about\nHow horrible America how about how it just it is how people are discriminated against outrage says we

are covering this race correctly FBI undercover agent paid suit tab\nFor Andrew Gillum fundraiser documents ... let me tell you a Florida particularly you independence haven't voted yet or thinking about it you can have a guy here who is under investigation for his entire governorship if you elect to measure governor because this guy was taken freebies left and right\nYou know about the Costa Rica trip you know about the Hamilton ticket you know about the hotel in New York City these things are worth thousands of dollars\nBut here's the breaking story tonight by the Tallahassee Democrat and undercover FBI agent\nPosing as an Atlanta developer\nSeeking to do business with the city of Tallahassee where he was mayor Gillum\nPicked up the catering bill Frey twenty sixteen fundraiser for mayor Andrew Gillum nascent political action committee forward Florida\nThe pack would eventually become the war chest of dealings gubernatorial campaign it is the first piece of evidence linking the ongoing FBI pro Gillum broader campaign for statewide office\nAnd that stuff's trickling out trickling out not due to the scientists campaign or the Republicans but due to one of the people whose caught up in this lobbyist\n\nThe emails and receipts released her friday today as part of a supplemental records requests from the Florida commission on ethics\nShows that the agent the undercover FBI agent Mike Miller was invoice four thousand three hundred and eighty six dollars by one oh one restaurant and meant lounge a restaurant owned by lobbyists Adam Corey at the time to this guy Korea's buddies\nOr was what Gillum\nAnd email exchange shows that Miller paid the bill and Gillum send them a personal thank you how does a thank you note uh for the food now Galen has been a line through his teeth all along about the extent of this investigation and he knows the extent of the ... investigation\nSort of lying about the extent of the FBI investigation he's been lying about his involvement and corruption in the city\nOf Tallahassee and it is corrupt and today again is trashing police officers police officers that are forced to to to draw a weapon even a taser well then they've blown it according to him\nA month after meeting Mike Miller this is the FBI undercover agent for breakfast that the power plant cafe or at the Edison\nCorey that's the lobbyists and lifted the undercover agent to help foot the bill for a fundraising dinner a courthouse on behalf of gums gubernatorial campaign I'll keep in mind or Cory the lobbyist and buddy of a Gillum didn't know that this guy Miller was undercover agent of course\n[noise] and email exchange between Corey and lo and\nBryce Barnes a Florida Democratic Party official who go on to become finance director for building a ... campaign show them arranging a dinner fundraiser at Coors house for forward a Florida Gillum gubernatorial pack\nPack was originally set up as they generally so now you have a his gubernatorial pack\nDoing a fundraiser and the male is paid for by the undercover agent the undercover FBI agent not clearly that's illegal the fire build\nThe event is honoring Gillum and in one email Barnes describe it as the first kick up a vent for his campaign so tender by roughly forty Tallahassee notable Z\nIncluding this one in that one with a past way with the outstanding to get to thirty seven thousand eight hundred and fifty whatever we can push to get us over that forty thousand dollar mark would be amazing Barnes wrote to Corey thank you again for all your work to make it successful event last night\nThe minimum donation for the dinner was five thousand dollars a person\nFor you once again based on fact for the\nEverybody Martin living here are number have seven seven three one three won and won the seven seven three have one ... one one way with special guest at the bottom of the hour as\nWe have this entire week and we will next week as we try to address some of the important races where I feel we need to hold the hold our ground [noise] Brock Obama was in Wisconsin today\nAnd he said something very very important and I want you to listen to this as we'll discuss it cuts sixteen go\nUp and he's trying to make it hard for stitches since devote\nA lot of the hate and poison and division\nI as a result of bronco bomb and propaganda like that eight years of that eight years of or not a years But Eric holder\nAnd you hear other people from his administration Hillary Clinton\nThey've created these these wedge issues they've done a hell of a job but turn in this country inside out and upside down fundamental transformation\n\nBut what he's saying actually was stolen from Franklin Roosevelt in a famous speech that he gave that I made famous I guess from the Nineteen twenties\nHe said we have these respite some paraphrasing\nWe progress as we advance advance but we don't hold office long enough to do the things we have to do and so they figured out what they need to do is create this permanent bureaucracy and take over the courts which is something Woodrow Wilson push for\n\nOur founding fathers are used\nIn very diabolical ways by leftist like Brock Obama on the one hand they condemn them\nSaying they owned slaves some did some did\n\nOn the other hand they use the declaration of independence and less so but sometimes the constitution to claim that what they're advancing\nIs what the founders and the frame or is actually intended and so if you really don't train your mind to understand that soon followed this it can be alluring or it can be confounding but it can also be Lauren\n\nWe've progressed as take two steps forward in these conservatives plus Pakistan\n\nAnd progressive ism is the way forward just say and progressive ism is what really the framers of the constitution intended and the declaration of independence nothing could be further from the truth he knows it but he lies\n\nOn alien about rights has nothing to do a government that has to do with the civil society\n\nThere was no federal government there was no national government when the declaration of independence was adopted\n\nUnalienable rights natural rights aggressive isn't rejects all this he knows that he's ...\nHe knows where Woodrow Wilson stood and Franklin Roosevelt study knows all about John ...\n\nAnd Henry crawling all arrested I've written about at some length\n\nHe knows mark swelling angles as well and go well [noise] and he knows that in order to create this utopia which is really hell on earth you have to destroy these institutions\n\nYou have to destroy the institutions unalienable rights has nothing to do with the progressive agenda\nPro union anti union minimum wage no minimum wage health care no health has nothing to do with that\n\nIt is a recognition that we are human beings that we're individuals and we have the right to be free\n\nAnd we're supposed to be treated equally under the law\n\nNothing to do with economic outcomes are minimum wage or the laundry list of ah of the left wing agenda\nAnd Obama in this just so you understand modern history Obama and this is a regurgitate in things that have been said by Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd his new nationalism speech Woodrow Wilson and multiple speeches that he gave\nAnd all of them attacked the declaration of independence or turn it inside out as Obama dead what he's doing here isn't particularly smart he just stealing the propaganda the past hundred years old more they wrap themselves in the declaration of independence\nBy rewriting it by rewriting\nI don't have enough time to get into this again if you read or rediscovering Americanism and the tyranny of progressive ism you'll know exactly what's going on here as I said when I wrote it over a year old I'm not hawking and I'm just saying if you want to understand that the tribes there\nHe wasn't done cut Seventeen go\nThat means first of all let's use English to keep what they got you mean to keep what they have the powerful and the privileged fight hard to keep what they they got\nWhat does that mean\nThe powerful\nCorporate executives or senators and congressmen professors couldn't doctrine ate their students\nMedia personalities who who the powerful exactly\nGeorge Soros style or they want to get what they got\nWhat does that mean they want to keep what they got\nYou learn something legitimately by your smarts by your hard work whatever of course you want to be what you got why shouldn't you the most powerful people in this country or the people who run government\nBecause they have something that you do not have in the private sector you know what that is Mr producer\nThe law the law they control the law\nThey can punish people they can find people that can penalize people they can put people in prison\n\nThat's why the communist socialist the fascists they want to control the government they don't want to control this company or that company or this building that building they want the government they want to control the government you weren't constitution which he claims to support and does not\nControl the individual doesn't control business it doesn't control the private sector doesn't control private property it's intended to control government\nBecause governments where the power is governments where the power is\nGo ahead\nIs is to visit rhetoric if\nSomebody really believes what Obama said that this is what's going on these people are privileged they're powerful they've taken they get to keep what they've got or if they believe what ... says and the others saying compared Trump the Hitler and everything does it not incite people\nGo ahead\nGee whiz who does that here we have that demagogue pointing fingers at others

and getting a very dangerous and very deeply deranged individual\nInto custody in solving this mystery of the great bomb scare with fourteen different packages sent to fourteen different people around the country [noise] getting that things solved in record time I know I Know I Know it's always tempting\nTo try to jump on the president the United states or to jump on people in the mainstream media or to jump on one party or another party or this one or that one and say boy did you ever get it wrong boy is is terrible boy are you to blame\nI uh I I Want to try to avoid that because honestly we\nHave every reason to celebrate as a country and President Trump has been speaking recently about the need to come together and to see things and harmony and to see things as Americans not as Republicans or Democrats or pro Trump or is there an anti Trump per se but basically to look at this\nThing citizens and when you look at this thing uh this has been remarkable and one of the things that I literally just moments before I got on the air here I put out a tweet that said look this should remind everybody of how lucky\nWe are to have people in place like yes Jeff Sessions and you ask Christopher Wray the head of the FBI and yes all of those extraordinary people who work every single day sometimes putting their lives on the line\nTo keep us safe through the FBI and the rest of the law enforcement\nThrough the New York city police to the local Florida police we just had a um a moment with Jeff Sessions are announcing the arrest if you haven't heard it and you probably have but Caesar say all coups fifty six years old\nWho um at least as far as I can gather has no known employment\nAppears to have been living in his van and yes his van is festooned with all kinds of a political a bumper stickers and posters it's actually kind of artfully designed but the messages on the van are insane and a despicable\nAnd dare I say it deplorable\nIn any event he was a arrested today taken into custody he's having multiple charges filed against him\nHe was being interrogated in what they call a national security exemption in other words they can't interrogate him without an attorney present dinner fear I think that what they're trying to do is to determine\nWhether or not he had any accomplices or had any associates in a doesn't appear to a a guy with a very very long criminal history\nA guy who as I mentioned may or may not have been living in his van recently uh before that during another very serious criminal charges in during another bankruptcy that he declared he was living with his mom\nAnd I'm at ... we're not talking about a an ... an upstanding or model citizen and when you look at pictures of the van I you know I think about this because\nMy most important role in the world is that right and that is true for probably many many of the males who were listening to me\nAnd I was looking at the pictures of the van with all the messages on it and literally you can't see out the windows because the windows are totally covered with top youth soccer recruits for Trump drain the swamp dishonest media CNN sucks I'm hard rock weekly\nOr they have a seminal hard rock weekly now this has led to some confusion\nI think because people are saying well he may or may not be Native American I think the seminal there is not a reference to the tribe it's a reference\nTo the football team or to the um [noise] uh Florida State Seminoles I Believe it is in any other also pictures of Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton\nAnd I believe in the Van Jones a with a targets on their faces and that's not good but in any event I ... what I was trying to imagine\nIs think if you have a daughter\nAnd somebody's coming up to pick up your daughter in front of the house and he's driving a vast like [laughter] I mean I'm ... [noise] I Know somebody is is it okay if I say who it is Greg\nIt's you or who has suggested a that any any time that police spot a van or a car\nOr any kind of people with more than six bumper stickers they ought to investigate it immediately in any event this uh this is a sort of a tip off to where he was coming from but this is the way Jeff Sessions sounded this morning and and by the way I Hope that this leads to President Trump and all the rest of us\nAppreciating the attorney general a little bit more appropriately here's the attorney general of the United states\nAnd blue to participate in this amount that I suspect is in the city or the FBI I Want to remind everyone to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged to die\nWith fire federal crimes including interstate transportation an explosive\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former president some certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers for these charges the defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nThese charges made a change or expand as the investigation pursued\nThis is the law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political violence\nOkay good for him a he's he's exactly right and you know what the president spoke beautifully this morning no I mean it uh the Twitter feed probably best ignored but uh his speaking this morning was solid\nHe uh he was speaking to a great group and there were so enthusiastic and he was bonding with him so well it was a moving occasion\nHe was speaking to turning point USA's young black leadership summit and it's it's ironic I just this morning I left um Minneapolis I left the hotel this morning at five\nAnd five AM and I wrote to the airport with my friend and colleague Larry Elder who was on his way to precisely this young black leadership summit\nAnd uh it here's what the president sounded like with the announcement before he began what was a very successful and a fine speech to the people who are attending that somebody who is president the United states\nI like to begin as you are leaders that's a real leaders\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our country band a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect had taken him into custody\n[noise]\nCredible job by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigations find that person or persons responsible for these\nEvents terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nI was struck the authorities to spare no resource are expensive and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [noise]\nWe will prosecute them him her whoever it made me not\nExtent of the law\nOkay a good for you Mr President and then he went on to say this\nMuch never allow political violence to take root in America cannot flooded out I don't\nRead I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nI've just concluded a briefing with the department of justice is following the apprehension of the suspects\nI Want to applaud the FBI Secret Service department of justice the U.S attorney's office for the southern district of New York [noise] the NYPD federal law enforcement throughout the entire country credible partners these people to work so hard\nAnd to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done an incredible\nIncredible job but I Want to congratulate [noise] okay that's the president of\nThe United states and this is a fine moment for President Trump and I know he didn't ah the debt so said the DNA on the saliva on the stamps from the packages\nTo understand for people on the left who have been trying to see the acts of this uh evil Mad Men and he is both evil and he clearly as a madman he's also a total loser will go over his arrest\nRecord coming up it's bad that takes almost a segment on its own because he has an extensive prolific arrest record including a prior arrests record for threatening to blow people up with bombs are there are real questions about why he was running around out among us and I'm ... the plant over here\nIs I Would just [noise]\nTry to get folks on on the left including I ...

they're racist show of his show you're not in some\nCartoonish way you get them off the hook you know what I'm saying\nSo two things happen here first seat admitting that America is not a racist country he doesn't realize he just it but he did and the second thing is you must characterize your opponent as racist to ensure that most people won't vote for him\nThat's why you have Ronald Reagan being called a racist that's why you have George W. Bush being called a racist that's why I'm actually one is called George Herbert Walker Bush or racist that's why the less calls Donald Trump or racist\nWho's going to go for a racist just random racist\nNow you might be persuasive if they didn't do it all the time\n\nWould have William clay and a member of the house say about Ronald Reagan when he's running Ronald Reagan got his racist precepts from mine cops are you kidding me\n\nJulian Bond the head of the ... in double ACP said that George W. Bush got his cabinet appointees from the Taliban wing of the Republican Party are you kidding me\n\nAnd then you have the admission mainly for white people because why people won't vote for a guy most them if they think they're racist show of his show you're not in some\nCartoonish way you get them off the hook you know what I'm saying if\nAnybody playing the race card any white guy playing the race card more than Joe Biden\n\nHe said that a Mitt Romney did not want additional regulations on Wall street Unchained Wall Street want to put you all back in chains they don't want black people voting\n\nFlickers of these guys are all about man the Republicans don't want war of the class people vote they don't want black folks vote and look at what we're doing now\n[noise] and I have one more comment for ah for my friend from the Atlantic magazine\nWell look this and this is a country where we make an exceedingly hard to vote we do that because a historically ... we have not one that the country in the United states of America is not wanted black people or poor people to votes\n[noise] two thousand eight percentage of black people exceeded the percentage of white people voting for the first time in our nation's history as a percentage of eligible voters more blacks voted than whites did two thousand they how was it possible to all these laws have been passed\nTo suppress for some people have color how did that\nHappen\nIt's insulting and its ally\n\nNow breaking news Russian charged with conspiring to interfere with us question elections because it from writers\nUS government on friday today chart the Russian national would play with ... playing a key financial role in a Kremlin backed plan to conduct information warfare\nAgainst the United states including influencing next month's rational elections it talks about ah this a Russian national having a war chest at thirty five million dollars a and using it to interfere with the election [noise]\nTrump has recently been asked once again does he believe the Russians interfered and he said yes so would you please stop saying that Trump does not believe that Washington a figure but he doesn't believe that the Russians interfered\nTo help him win as opposed to making sure that we lost if Hillary had run against a pet rock they would have tried to get her loose hated her\nFrom take something though the majority of Democrats according to a poll I recently read majority of Democrats believe not only that the Russians interfered but that they changed vote tallies\nAnd there is zero evidence zero that vote tally were changed Obama's homeland security director Jay Johnson said there was no evidence whatsoever that any voting tallies were changed no if the majority of Democrats believe it how is that so\n\nAnd it's the Russians I it's it's the Republicans and Donald Trump who promote lie after lie after lie how is it that the majority of Democrats believe that the Russians federally mental\n\nPositions designed relief factor as an essential way to support the body's natural fight against aches and pains it's made from wild caught fish oil and botanical like turmeric and it's a healthy way to get back into pain free life there is no side effects\nThere's no chemicals there is no preservatives there is nothing addictive\nAnd that's why you can be very confident that when you take really factor you have nothing to lose but your pain\nAnd the whole world to gain maybe can't wear your favorite shoes anymore because the pain in your feet relief factor can help with all of that Nineteen Ninety five comes to Ninety five cents a day that's less than a cup of coffee a day\nFor pain relief go to relieve factor dot com read all the testimonials find out about it for yourself and order that quick start just Nineteen Ninety five or Ninety five cents a day for three weeks or you can call them it's toll free they can answer all your questions one eight hundred\nFive hundred eight three four that toll free one eight hundred five hundred three eight for relief factor dot com\nThis is the Terminator listen to America's money a lot of the airways tore a mix married here at nine sixty the ... she's smart ...

that beautiful place you'd if you if you know anything about me at all I've been doing this monster show with you know we're in our ten year never missed the show in ten years very proud of that\nAnd if you've been listening and many of you have\nBeen listening for those ten years as a show continues to explode two hundred plus radio stations now lord knows however many venues other than that exist out there I'm not even aware of okay probably some affiliates I'm not even aware of but nonetheless if you've paid any attention to me at all over the last ten years you know\nMy affinity for the great state of Arizona love it love it I'm drawn to it can't explain why don't really care but feel very comfortable feel very home there\nAnd I spent some time out there last week\nAnd I'm ready to roll now\nBut I got a disclaimer for hundreds of thousands of you tuned in to the A R Daily Show tune into the Daily Show alive\nAnd by podcast in particular and I work in a couple of ... over a couple of dozen or thirty I forget about thirty armed American radio station affiliates if you've been tuned into a our daily program this week and many many of you are just mentioned from Wednesday on actually from Monday on\nYou might hear a little bit of similar discussion in our one and our three our one will be different because I've got a guess on that you've never heard before will be going to him momentarily but in our three I Will be bringing my tombstone adventure to this program\nFrom Monday's broadcast from tombstone where I spoke with the mayor dust and ask a pool and activist and hotel owner businessman entrepreneur ... owner if Larry a motel give them a big plug out there in Tucson, Arizona Mr Gordon Anderson\nAnd Alan Gottlieb because Alan Gottlieb ... years you know if he was in the daytime show we're into stone Arizona on Monday and Tuesday broadcasting from that living breathing history museum that's what tombstone is\nSo we'll talk a little bit about that tonight with my upcoming guests you'll find them fascinating we'll go to him and just a minute but want to throw that disclaimer out that I'm going to run that our\nFrom Tucson from tombstone Monday show because I had just an amazing conversation with the mayor and with Gordon there's some big things going on in tombstone relative to your right to keep and bear arms they're thinking big out there I'll tell you about it and just a little bit\nSo enjoyed that third our as I bring it to this monster cast I Want you to hear it on this giant enormous show and two hundred affiliates that don't get to hear the daytime show you're going to love it so let me start with why was I in Arizona to begin with\nThe Arizona citizens defense league [noise] excuse me they asked me to speak I have three or four times now I I I've lost count but I Love speaking of that event each year I'm a life member now so here's kind of my progression of\nMy speaking relationship with the folks out at Arizona citizens eventually I actually woke up in tombstone Arizona a number of years ago put my genes on through on a shirt strapped on a firearm\nPut my stepson on put my fry boots on stuck\nA gun on my hip and drove to Tucson to speak to the Arizona citizens defense league meeting and I thought that was kind of cool when it dawned on me man I woke up in Tucson, Arizona today put my boots my ... my gun on\nIt came up here to Tucson to speak to\nOne of the greatest pro gun rights organizations grassroots organizations in the country I thought that was kinda cool to me that school so because I Love Arizona and protect in particular I Love to just don't\nTrust that was when I was a basic member of the organization at that time card carrying the next year I spoke as a sustaining member in Phoenix and then a couple of years later this year\nI speak as a life member and I couldn't be more proud of that fact\nSo this year\nI ended up with Alan Gottlieb and who you hear on the program founder of a Second Amendment foundation usually hear around every week Allen I've been planning on personal trip the tombstone for just a couple of days to get out what turns out\nThat Gordon Anderson who we met in shots show in Vegas a couple of years ago invited us out along with the mayor of tombstone\nTo assist them with and appear at their freedom day celebration in honor of their proclamation of America's first proclaimed official Second Amendment city but it happened kind of quick and both of us were unable to get out there in June for personal reasons so we came out there\nThis past week now\nHad already pre planned his trip so it was an awful lot of fun to pop into town out an eye on Monday we stayed until Tuesday we brought to live armed American radio daily shows from that living breathing history museum I've also broadcasted from tombstone in the past a number of years ago about four years ago as well\nSo we were there for a number of reasons not just the history in the front of the town but we were working both days in fact Alan ... USA Today op ed piece from malaria motel and assisted me a production of both radio program so not all play I could sure use a lot of work going on\nBut here's the fun part and you're going to hear this in the third our today as I bring you the actual daily program for Monday This week from tombstone where my first guest was the tombstone mare\nDustin ask a pool who unbeknownst to Alan Gottlieb myself prior to the program presented each of us with an honorary citizen of Tucson plaque\nAlong with two golden keys to the city now again if you know anything about me that's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me because I've been going out to Tucson for twenty five plus years\nSo to have that to me it was an absolute incredible honor I had no idea that he was going to do that and it took both of us by surprise I have that ... sitting right here and I can promise you that's the coolest thing and I have a lot of cool things on the wall studio I can promise you from NASCAR stuff to gun stuff\nTo this this right here ranks right up there AS number one or at least tied for number one\n[noise] but I got to tell you what were we doing there why were we there because we're beginning assisting that incredible little town with their upcoming freedom day celebration in June of twenty Nineteen next year where I can promise you will be there\nThey're thinking big into stone and they want our help and we are more than happy to assist them\nAnd we will be bringing some big names to that town in June I Can't give you the ... who's who yet as it's building and we've got to reach out to a number of people but let's just say there will be a number of huge national celebrity figures as\nIn fact it to be out there pro gun rights celebrities yeah hard to find right but they're out there some of them made movies that you might be familiar with like why it happened to them so you know that kind of stuff\nIn fact right now about tumors into stone as I speak to you right now we got into town today we're hopeful that maybe we can bring him back again\nIn June he's been there before but the list is building for movie stars to talk radio host that you listen to and see on national TV politicians newsmakers\nSo it's going to be a giant enormous event in tombstone and we want you to make the pilgrimage with us there will be more on that over upcoming shows in months as we get closer to June to believe they just got to be on you like that just going to happen so we'll have more on this throughout the year but suffice to say you'll hear a lot about it\nIn the third our specifics about it\nIs I talked to two of the city of tombstone movers and shakers Mr Gordon Anderson and married Dustin basketball who by the way that the conversation with him which is fascinating his family history you know he's going to tell you about it in the third our but it is just extremely cool one of the victims\nKilled by the perks at the gunfight at the OK Corral had eighty dollars in his pocket given to him\nBy the ... great grandfather for payments earlier that day that's the kind of cool stuff I'm Talking about the I Love that stuff so it's a ton of fun you don't want to miss the show if you've heard it if you heard it on Monday This week or or any of the hundreds of thousands upon cast listeners enjoy the encore remembering that the vast majority of\nThis huge weekend monster cast audience is tasting it for the first time okay coming up in the second hour from Breitbart News award winning journalist today our weekly contributor and political analyst the one and only Dr ...

there you can find them strolling across the bottom of the page a norm leaving some out I Apologize\nLet's get back over to Johnny rolling Johnny about one more segment laugh I'm going to read you an email that said okay this is an interesting email\nLet me ask this up who set this up for a\nWhile I was in Arizona I was talking a when I was at the ... this broadcast the monster broadcast Sunday broadcast last week\nIn Arizona at the Sheraton I was talking about how Arizona is widely regarded as the most gun friendly state the country and it is and that's because of the method of care you don't need a permit you go to Carrie binding citizen to go to Arizona carrier got simple as that carrier don't take it with you the Arizona feel free however I made the comment I\nSee more no guns allowed signs in Arizona on one trip that I see in Thirteen Years of living in Georgia\nOkay there's a reason up here's here's an email Matthew Murphy writes and mark tombstone is now Second Amendment city on yesterday's daily defense you mentioned that there were all kinds of signs around tombstone saying no guns allowed how can I claim\nTo be a Second Amendment city when all the establishment to say no guns allowed now let me give you my answer they don't want to turn it over to you\nMatthew that's a great question I've heard it before here's why it's Arizona State law it comes from alcohol serving establishments predominantly I don't think I've ever seen a no gun sign at a at a hat at a stepson\nOr gift shop if you will it only seems to be in restaurants serve alcohol now those signs in Arizona do carry the weight of law\nWhat I mean by that is if you walk into that establishment in violation of it sit at the bar and have a beer you can't be charged with criminal trespass immediately and the signage in Arizona doesn't have to meet a certain standard some owners of those establishment for whatever reason\nAs their owners have decided they don't want you when you can walk away now I have spoken and I won't name two of the popular bars in in tombstone I'm only in them by name doesn't matter Johnny but I've spoken to the owners of them on both occasions and\nBoth times I got the same response we would prefer you didn't but if you want to\nUh let us know and we'll check it for you\nNow on the Arizona law for ... if if if a business tells you and has a sign that says no guns allowed they by law in Arizona have to provide you\nA safe storage for that firearm while you weren't there most businesses don't believe it or not are not in compliance of that but that's why that is that the alcohol serving establishment Johnny you want to take that email from their\n... and you're right Omar pretty much and realized that uh you know we have people from all over the country over the world comes to stop and and some of these folks are are not familiar\nWith guns and they want to make a statement and then also you got some people that are just on the Gulf trouble so so\nWhat that is an insurance policy against someone told me and drinking too much and having a fire or maybe not knowing how to handle it again but er visits or someone that might not be familiar with was just how this goes and\nAnd you know personally and look the law is that if you you can go if there's no sign there you can take your government a ball boys to serve alcohol threat but you're not you're but but you can't drink\nYou got to say a ... if you got you know drink and so that's that's how that works\nAnd I got to stop you there too 'cause I got to throw this disclaimer into Johnny and that is Arizona is a constitutional carry permit let's carry state you do not need a permit in hand to carry a firearm in Arizona however\nIn order to carry into an establishment that serves alcohol you must have a permit constitutional Kerry is brilliant permit let's carry is prohibited sea so Matthew I what I'm telling you hear is it's the it's really state law that's in play here and not every bar and restaurant have that side\nBut there are a lot to do and and when you're in an area like Scottsdale like I'm at which is lots of bars and great restaurants you tend to see more of them in Arizona because state law allows for that\nAnd it does carry the weight of law you still have anti people out there even though it's a gun friendly state so I Hope I answered your question Johnny did you want to put an exclamation point on that\nI think he did really well and you're right and uh personally uh I just prefer not to freak all the places are going well maybe by ... on it you know a\nSimple but I'll go to where I can because again the bad\nPeople to the criminal is not going to do all of a sudden you know a a in an amazing how we see countries that that wall to disarm there's too many people go out there with their little signs that say oh I Want my mail\nBut you know a sub don't work very well just bullets or not the real food that amazing\nYeah they also don't work out they don't work well against no food or drink and studio either hold on one second\n[laughter]\nI was getting a little bit thirsty there are so yeah there you go up and I'm a ice cold water and you know a lot of these expensive equipment in here Johnny's you well know now there is a W I wrote this up on the twenty first which is today and I wanted to get your opinion on this with the last minute that we have\nGun control group urging people to Texas authorities and report armed citizens and the name of the group is guns down America let's see where they're at USA Today quota guns down America director I ... ...\nSaying given the troubling political rhetoric we've seen over the last two years and the guns are far too easy to obtain this campaign will help the majority of Americans who believe that fewer guns keep us safe or\nFight back and cast their ballots free from fear of intimidation well you know I just read that for the first time here's what it ought to say\nGiven the troubling political rhetoric from the left that we've seen over the last two years and that bonds are far too scary for those on the left this campaign will help the majority of ... who don't trust Americans feel a little better my response to that is go to hell what's your response to that one\nWell I'll tell you what a ... we have a special program and its coal adopted him if you have a gun out there they're struggling you at home\nAnd and you feel like it's a problem because we have families waiting to except you're going to go\nHere and there is\nWe can actually started his show\nI haven't spoken about to show me the issue\nOf all to see how it played out [noise]\nTo abuse the man was murdered [noise]\nBased on anything anybody can imagine it's indefensible morally indefensible crime was committed against them and [noise]\nThere's a lot about the man that I don't know I don't know what his views where he is portrayed as a liberal in Saudi Arabia against an autocratic regime\nBut they're all the reports about him but no matter what his views that this is obviously not something we can morally accept the question that looms larger than that however is why is there so much attention being paid here\nDissidents or regime opponents in the middle east are routinely murdered ...\n... it's one of the great puzzles of life but I think I have an answer to this one but it is often a puzzle as to why something dominate the news and something else doesn't\nThe Saudi or the Saudi regime that got rid of someone wanted to get rid of\nAnd now in the year twenty eight Jean this ease international\nNews to the extent that it is an ongoing daily story\n\nGiven how many people who who oppose Assad get tortured to death\nOr a ... a regime or in other off African regimes other Arab countries over most of them countries they have any people have been tortured to death in Iran can you remain warden\nSo why why is this so much of a fixation the question is not whether or not we accept what happened was the\nQuestion is why is there a fixation on this may well one reason as he wrote columns for the Washington Post so we have a connection to the west and specifically to the United states and the other is that we have\nPhotographic data\nRegards to I mean there man walks into a consulate and never walk south it's pretty damning where we have that on video we have a video of our men and dreams\nAnd we have the information about those men and during turkey and then leaving turkey so everything is obvious why the Saudi regime or elements of the Saudi regime would want to get rid of this man that's a puzzle to me did you ever hear of this guy\nI I'm I immersed myself in world affairs and I never heard of the guy\nAnd and and by the way and if you read the column so they're not exactly a set to leaving or revealing or or anything I mean it's the Washington Post talk to the Saudi right around a lot of understand that fine I Wish they had an Iranian writer\nWho was who was a dissident with a guy would be a dead on arrival the away\nSo here's my theory as to why they're such preoccupation with this ban\nThere are two reasons in my opinion one is Saudi Arabia's ally of the United states and the the media are far more preoccupied with\nThe bad things that allies do than the bad things that enemies to\nYeah you might want to ask why because I don't know fully this is a physicist now speculation\n\nThey would I think they would argue we we have influence on allies we don't have influence on enemies\nTherefore\nOn those that we can influence we should try to have some influence that's the most noble read of the preoccupation with the deprivation of allies as opposed to the deprivation of enemies\nRight there's ... there's nothing on the dissidents in Iran and when you run did in fact have an uprising during the\nDuring the Obama administration he essentially said nothing and the the ... that was defended by the entire liberal slash left media because it was ... bomber\nSo back to the question why is there such preoccupation because one one is it you have a moral sense and it's a very important thing for a lot of people think well up themselves\nAnd we we can feel good about ourselves we are bringing to the world's attention something terrible that they're an ally of the United states is the second reason\nIs that he is not only an ally of the Saudi regime was not only in LA of the United states is an ally of the most hated man in the world most hated man in the world for the left is about Kim Jong un and it is about the Ayatollah Khamenei me\nAnd that is not the end is knocked Bush shot out of ... it is Donald Trump is by far the most hated man in the world's media because worlds maybe by the left and the left hates him more than any one and if she has a friend the friend is hated\n\nThose are the two reasons so why are we supposed to do here is the question on the tape what are we supposed to do we can't deny and it's because it's it would be a lawyer and you can tell lies cat that I went to Saudi regime that does it go up all the way to the crown prince we don't know\nBut it was these are these are pretty well connected man apparently\nWho are engaged in this murder so what are we supposed to do [noise]\nCancel a hundred billion dollars what what is this something that they ever ordered\nIt and then five hundred billion right\nThat's a lot of that's a lot of jobs so you'll say well listen morale will be more important than jobs to which the answer is what is ... ... yes it is yes morality is more important than jobs however there are two big caviar tier\nOne is jobs is a moral issue it's not\nIt's not unrelated to morality whether or not we can all of a naval tens of thousands of Americans to work\nBut if but murder is murder I I I fully agree I have a hierarchy of moral good and the hierarchy of moral bad that's a very big component of wind moral thinking\nBut the a lot of save the Saudi regime or toppled because of sanctions by the United states first of all if they didn't have America to buy stuff from they would buy it elsewhere\nThey're not going to stop buying military equipment number two and most important if you really want to talk more real than the greatest moral good right now might be in the world the world scene might be opposing Iran\nIran is the most evil actor on earth\nThe north Korean regime is the most evil regime domestically\nThe Iranian regime is the most evil regime in terms of foreign evil evil outside of its borders\nIt's it's great enemy is Saudi Arabia\nNow you'll say so we are supposed to compromise our values because they're our ally and because the enemy of the ... the enemy is my friend no you don't compromise your moral values you speak out\nYou condemn you try to make that light or a more decent place but you don't abandon that ally because there are greater goods the most obvious example being a man of didn't kill one dissident but about twenty five million\nGift that figure because it's not possible for the human mind to wrap itself around it and that is Joseph Stalin and we back Joseph Stalin knowing that he was slaughtering people in the millions because he was on our side against a greater enemy Adolf Hitler\nAnd that is the way the world works for people who are willing to look at the world the way it works not the way we imagine we allowed to Jimmy Carter allowed the America under Jimmy Carter allowed the shah to step down in Iraq\nThat murder of cars showcase despicable\nIn life the question is not only correctly labeling bad\nAs bad acts it's what do you do about them afterwards\n[laughter]\nThat's that's the way it works on ... in the real world the real world is not pleasant and then the real world you will fight evil with people who are morally troubled\nThemselves\nAnd in this case it Saudi Arabia and ironically it's happening when Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally better place that's the irony\nRight\nFeinstein Feinstein wants to reopen Kavanaugh hearings if the Democrats take control the Senate Dianne Feinstein his so deteriorated visit

white voters against black voters and Hispanic voters did you see that it was the Washington Post I think but it might have been to New York times\nThey hate the Senate because the Senate like the electoral college is state based not population based\n[noise] this is the United states of America the states or to have their own worlds indeed genius I could cry about the genius of the founders of

D. in Miami and it is truly an honor and a pleasure to be here anytime I I Am able to join you feel it in for the great one more call in by the way you can catch me\nAt Bryan mud radio on Twitter now\nWrapping up last hour I mentioned that President Trump\nWas likely to be reelected if for no other reason than he is an incumbent president running for reelection historically sixty five percent for nearly two thirds of all the presidents who run will win\nOnly what we have is a presidential election it's about the incoming president so frankly really doesn't matter first and foremost whether it's ... or Pocahontas or whatever\nIt matters who in what Donald Trump is represented wanting to accomplish and you really have to screw up you really have to screw up in order to be in the ... been president and lose if you're running for reelection I'm gonna come back around to the Saudi Arabians and you're in a minute\nSo when you put this in context you think about why because for folks on the left and there's just beside themselves they can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not get ration day I had to listen to pin ads around their\nHours he's he's out after the first is going to be a beach but he he would never be a re elected I mean people already seen them say to me\nLike you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting that in context you have to take a look at\nWhy don't we take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working on for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration and for info you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yeah I was a four did break for Donald Trump beyond that\nSince the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past few years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nEither way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independent set of registered to vote for a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from my point of partisanship registered to vote like an all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time of young people to go down registering to vote and then they're all Democrats from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in Virginia last hour\nWho's also conservative too that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised that part of the story but beyond that you got to think about what's happening here and there is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst you you take a look at the economy we have the best economy and the generation\nMillennials from buying into the hope and change bull crap\nThey didn't know better they went through his hearing from a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and do we have this really does suck the euro bomb and they go well I guess he's white and you're given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you got the mines are up and\nThat's the gun in the in the generation\nWe have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end of the Affordable CARE Act mandate employment rate in forty nine years and by the way the unemployment for demographics except Asian and white man yeah remember\nAbout the land and they use them and they will demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right out over by the way\nBut you also have the biggest increase in the take home pay in thirty two years ago I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I received a note from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to lay the groundwork for that one once again because it's not hard to get their maps\nAnd it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nAnd works like this you take to you\nSalary that the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it's pays about two point eight percent base salary year over year okay All right then you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when\nYou do that that gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employee person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated two sides to stories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the anger leftist that goes yeah but I\nHaven't seen a benefit for the tax cuts well that's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the white person like thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not saying that it will be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government and interest free one but\nIt's still there because of well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that and two years but he is or is if anything he probably is attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty he probably gets re elected\nSo once things didn't work out exactly the way that we all hope to

I guess what they mean legal fees Ivey has any money [laughter]\nHe and she had to pay me a lot of legal fees and as a whole lot of animal for this or Texas Lubbock, Texas based on Texas law with a legal fees are nice and pleasant fall and your whole better than to say that you are you serious courthouses disappointed if I say it is a a lot [noise]\nThat was the the president was first Reagan for five minutes or just a few hours ago [noise]\nIn forest shore and there are so many different directions I Want to go either way I Need to trick pony when it comes to references I'm really proud of myself as I graduated from Monty Python or Seinfeld\nAnd the only thing I've had on my mind with what the president has been up to I and I had to go back and pull the plug because there was a magazine it was that the one the Seinfeld episode where I think it was actually Kathy Griffin who ironically enough ah Jerry was talking about said that she does think she should quit\nBut I wanted to be because to me it should be the traditional route years of rejection and failure until she spit out at the bottom of the porn industry help it because I feel like that's what's happening right here except in that case a stormy here you know she started out in the porn industry\nYou knew I was the interesting characterizations of her right\nYou know she'll she'll go from a a certain level of decorum you know she is a an adult film star other time she gets a a porn actress or whatever it's uh it's interesting but nevertheless by the way\nI Am your or south for the friend Bryan mutt doing morning show\nOn WGN in West Palm Beach a mid morning show after that W I O D and Miami\nAnd every now and then I think the Fox is folks at Fox News or run out of radio people to put on TV and they put me on so you I'm a gift contributor to Fox and this is one of the things here and there it's always an honor and pleasure to be able to fill in for the great one more call Dan\nAnd a holy cow or this happened as well related to the whole story Daniels ... saying earlier today the president's out about four hours or so ago\nTweeted out citing Fox News federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump\nTrump is entitled to a full legal fees\nAnd a comment off of that a President Trump said great talent could go after a horse face an earth deliberate a lawyer and the great state of Texas she won't confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a toll con\nOr there you go good old horse face oh boy [laughter]\nSo that happened\nIt got us thinking of some of the nonsensical things that are happening now bear he got the Taylor Swift effect remember a couple of Sundays ago where the earth moved because Taylor Swift he Taylor Swift she did it after years\nAfter years of the entertainment industry and the folks on the left they finally got her to do it\nThat was going to move literally one of the mountains I think in the eastern Tennessee\nThat Taylor Swift effect as she weighed in with her Tennessee values\nWhich the first thing to do with that Taylor Swift is to Tennessee water ... Warren is to Cherokee Indians want all owned\nSmall details I'll get there I uh I couldn't help by itself but to put together some information on Taylor Swift and on the race that she endorsed and her clear lack of understanding of any of it\nWhen I ended up writing this was a headline I Believe it was on Sunday on CNBC ... Taylor Swiss political endorsement could become the biggest red\nAt the polls will ever is a poll [laughter]\nI mean that OK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought here's an actor\nLast way pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking or stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in our home state of Tennessee\nBe effective Swiss surprise endorsement which was mainly on Instagram post or felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now I'm\nGonna get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media recently has a couple of days ago are still my gosh it's happening I think it's quieted down a little bit over the past the hour or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going hey\nAre you so he was up in Tennessee or the um Taylor's specific endorsement of\nThe Democrat so Britain sending in tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nSheila's averaging a three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee alright Blackburn three point lead and the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect\nWhere is she today and the three most recent polls that particular race is now nine points so\nOh not exactly what you probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the raised bed she finally weighing in on is negative six percent\nIn a week so does that you've got two sides to stories in one side the facts but here's the deal\nHe got a lot of folks that are filling a familiar with the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction or science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing that I'm In the south in particular\nYou had a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities better away in the end and specifically when she ended up outing herself\nPretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nSafe if you're in Tennessee and you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons\nAmong others now she said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values\nBut you see here is that the the dirty little detail Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee\nShe's from Pennsylvania Pennsylvania and she happened only moved to a tendency to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life\nYou know in the you know Taylor Swift is Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is too too Cherokee Indians you know the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas smelling now\nShe spoke up supporting elegy being he writes\n... rights as part of her Tennessee value is by the way\n[noise] I guess what the Democrats the she endorsed bill Bratton than he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's not as much [laughter] so and it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in no go [laughter]\nAnd then you got the optics we see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in Nashville better yeah\nBut here's the thing anybody noticed that he got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy\nWho does not support gay marriage and host of other old GB T rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania\nSo she's endorsing in the old white guy bad have all these days left his politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\nI mean and there was a lot more we we can continue\nDown that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those into the sea they pretty much get the point to and law law\nIn terms of Tennessee values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity in in Hollywood endorsements and to\nWell not often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the fact that they weren't the painting I mean come on\nAll the celebrity endorsements work right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm by the way it wasn't an awkward moment I mean I did the trick is does\nAnd so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kind of Mr moment you see it she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nLA Paul Allen cofounder of Microsoft okay so stay with the entertainment they promote it pedaling here from CNN line Matt Damon total areas
