of one of the biggest problems is that we are so cheap and racism and anti Semitism anytime you disagree with somebody you're in a racist wrap that somebody and when we run up against people who are truly hate it gets lost in the shop it just gets it just becomes well\nI I think you're entirely correct and it's an extraordinarily important point it's the old story of crying wolf\nAnd it's why comparisons with Hitler or so mistaken and if everything is racist then it becomes nothing is racist you it means that you can't recognize an sanction the real thing when it happens appreciate your

Will call you later and my wife said are calling now\nLet us area was very generous eve yeah so ... so you I and and basically you describe in your ear piece in American Spectator a report from Pittsburgh has posted up at our website at Michael Mann that I've come along with information about polls wonderful book a pope and the president\nOr ... you described in there how they waited out they duct in in the van they were writing in and then finally they were able to drive a little bit out of harm's way\nI Do you know what amazes me about this poll is that is it's very much fits in with a I've gone back and looked at every deadly attack on a Jewish target\nIn the United states since Nineteen Seventy seven or so for the last forty years and but bless Italy there aren't that many of them\nAnd [noise] but most of the people who died in those attacks\nWere a Christian people who are caught in the crossfire or or even in the crossfire because mostly no one was firing back they were Christian people who were in some cases just wrongly targeted there was a ... a beautiful guy very devout a Christian and the son of a minister\nWho in April thirteenth two thousand fourteen he was killed by an anti Semite who was attacking the Jewish community center he just brought his grandson there and the grandson was killed two for a singing audition they were doing a program that the Jewish community center\nYeah well that's precisely what were we were worried about was them getting caught in the crossfire\nAlso to Michael I immediately thought of it because at first we didn't know who is doing the shooting right and so I thought okay what's that date\nOctober twenty seven twenty eight in the day before on friday and my Middle East politics class at grow City College we just finished teaching the Yom Kippur war of Nineteen Seventy three which it ended I think almost forty five years ago that day on Saturday\nSo I I immediately thought to myself I Wonder if this is a a radical she hottest attack and unfortunately it wasn't\nHad not had nothing to do with that but this was just some loan wacko\n... a Nazi apparently a who and I and and the worst thing about something like this is I don't know what you could even do to stop it other than\nBetter surveillance possibly I don't know who would do the survey and what I Would say this people listening\nIf you know somebody on Facebook or on social media who's posting vile hateful things like this and it was bragging about his weapons collection and and who's talking about maybe going down to the to the

Michael midday dot com\nAnd I should also noticed Brian did that uh the battle of New Orleans and the miraculous details concerning that battle also feature in my book the American miracle yeah the\nAh President Trump is restored Andrew Jackson's portrait to the White House and he clearly admires president Jackson I could President Trump for this moment in his presidency with all of its challenges could he learn something from Jackson's example\nI think so because Jackson was like LBJ LBJ was Jackson more where he said okay what do you need to get it done because you got to get what I Want done he heard a lot of deals with the Senate and leverage to leverage his power a gotten a lot of people face but in the end he got things done\nAnd he ... he turn the economy over to Martin Van Buren actually with a surplus and he was the last president to do to not have a devastating\nSo I think that he had to make some deals for that to the same time ah you know both to programs at all out of the country to grow\nAnd he understood the working class more than ... percent more than that it was more than my role for the Washington I'm you know more than John Quincy Adams says he was born leader remains an orphan and he understood he really thought a Midwestern badly south to the southwest was totally ignored\nSo I think that because Donald Trump constituencies that same morning proportion I didn't even go in Khartoum deals in order to have is greater objective for health and then see what happens after two years if you lose the house you don't see what happens after six years that we get the second time\nSo I think back to what they need to learn but the relentless the fighting spirit he's pretty much got that down\n[laughter] yeah he does um but Jackson or in in terms of his fighting spirit also had this great ability\nOf making up with people that he was fighting against the one point he had he had actually for a dual ... with a and been involved in a very bloody brawl with Thomas hard Benton the senator from Missouri who became one of his closest allies and he'll get his program through\nThat may be comparable to the Ted Cruz Donald Trump relationship\nAnd the Marco Rubio and Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham and the Nikki Haley\nA he has a lot of people that were critical okay I'm working with it by what they were were were willing to put

this Donald Trump got to get over this free trade agreement plus the free trade free trade is good and Donald Trump is is almost one Larry over but he didn't uh he did not want to come in because\nHe said you know the I Can't really go forward button up all these deals but then after a few months after talking to him he's now in in the beginning chocolate or you know\nI think I think the idea for Larry is then as he's believing President Trump that\nThe whole goal of a tougher negotiating posture is lower tariffs all around for us and for them we will be right back with just a few minutes more

nonsense is Trump's anti Semitism was to blame or stoking of anti Semitic statement sores dog whistles\n[noise] I sure as hell hope at some point soon someone will stand up for the first amendment again and remind people the political speech is not to be blamed for the actions of a Mad Men are racist\n[noise] was Donald Trump to blame for the bomb threat the suspicious package mailer made and was convicted four and two thousand two\nOf course not and neither was anyone else\nBill Clinton was not responsible for the Oklahoma bombing any more than the rhetoric of rock Obama was responsible for Fort Hood if you want to talk policies that is a different thing\nBut the idea that fairly normal political speech can be the blame for the actions of the lunatic or racist is so far from our normal understanding of politics that it should be laughable\nUnfortunately it is not so who's rhetoric was to blame for Susan Collins having white powder mail to her office or the breaking into of Ted Cruz's officer the white powder mail to Donald Trump son and daughter in law with a note reading you get what you deserve\nI've been saying the idea that Trump calls some news fake news as an inspiration journalist site for violence is absolutely ridiculous since one was the word fake shouted or otherwise an incitement to anything from a nap to a half marathon\nOliver Wendell Holmes did not warn of the dangerous to and limits of free speech by denouncing the yelling of the word fake falsely in a crowded theater\nTo blame any violence on the use of the word fake is itself the theater of the absurd\nThough I Do understand how journalists wants to make themselves and their bravery and standing up to Donald Trump the story\nWhere were they when Barack Obama was actually wiretapping journalists well they'd been all over Brock Obama where he a Republican and we all know that but what violence to journalists in America has there been\nNone\nThe journalists need to go back and read their a soft fables starting with the boy who cried wolf\nDon't get me wrong there's been violence against journalists just known I can see attributed Trump the way journalists tried to bootstrap their case against him [noise] well I'm told south it's not just the fake news it's calling the press the enemy of the people okay I hear that a lot from Jim Acosta\nHe works for CNN [noise] where was he when CNN started the whole damn thing of making your political opponents your enemies\nI give you Anderson Cooper\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt said I ask you to judge me by the enemies I haven't may you may be more upset over your political career as a witch enemy or are you most proud of [noise]\nI guess the whole lobby I\nWorked hard for climate change and I want to work with the cola a foot in my time in the Senate tried to bring them to the table so that we could address carbon dioxide I'm proud to be a dodge cynical lobby governor O'Malley the national Rifle Association\n[noise]\nHealth insurance companies that drug companies\n[noise] hey rainy and [noise]\nProbably the Republican\nOr you go I Hope you noted what Hillary Clinton did with that not content with calling Republicans her enemies she put them in the same category as Iran the worst terrorist regime in the world so there you go to CNN starts it\nHilary makes it even worse and Donald Trump is to blame\nThese guys really do need to look in the mirror and then go read a First Amendment case and then maybe go read a book on hypocrisy and then maybe go read a book on American history if they can find one\nWhich gets us back to Pittsburgh it seems hardly enough for people to denounce anti Semitism\nBut as soon as Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton apologize for bills backslapping and sitting with Louis ... a month ago all start thinking the Democratic party for beginning to end its trafficking in it\nIt is a problem of the left generally these days just look at what goes on at our college campuses from UCLA\nTo overland what the toleration of and promotion of speakers who conflate Israel's policies with all Jews and have no problem hosting Hamas and Hezbollah apologist hell Columbia University brought in awkward dinner job to speak anyone remember that\nI had a friend emailed me of the day\nHe asked can you believe what's going on in this country what's happening to us well yes I can Hitler and not seeing them have been normalized and detoxify or they are now no worse than George Bush or Donald Trump to the left\nYou saw that and you see it today in their posters all the damned time at their protests have devoted a lot of words to the problem but we also need a little perspective to\nThis is not anything like some of our worst times we can find plenty of years much worse than this one\nNineteen sixty eight has known by some of us has an is horrible is not only did it feature the burning and riding the city's major cities in America a lot of bombings on college campuses but also the assassinations of Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy\nSome adults from that era told me there were serious question in their minds about whether America would survive literally survive a year [noise]\nOf course we have done and we've had worst fears as well cable news of course makes it worse not in stoking\nIt so much is heightening it no discrimination between the frivolous and the critical the important and the unimportant Russia's non collusion and Paul Manafort's non conviction for collusion in an election is as important to CNN as anything else including the synagogue bombing\nThat's how they survive keeping themselves necessary by making themselves important stoking Anita fake need\nTo need them to explain it all to us\nYet somehow someone going to seriously tell me we were less well informed as a people in Nineteen sixty eight\nI'll bet you on any possible index of knowledge sophistication air you diagnose being informed never mind educated we were much much much better in Nineteen sixty eight before cable or social media imagined that wonder why\nWhich gets us back to Pittsburgh again our hearts ache as they should at the shooting the death the massacre\nAnd why and how was the perpetrator not shot to death on the scene that would have been the most just of things and it would of course been what we would all have called a good shooting\nSays of course needs to be set it seems again and again not an anti Semitic or an anti Jewish country not any more than it is an anti Muslim country or an anti black country\nWe're the best country for all people everywhere just ask seven thousand Hondurans and we always have been\nAnd we should think our founders for that\nLet's all go back to our George Washington he set the standard for non bigotry and religious liberty here's what he wrote in his letter to the Rhode Island synagogue the first time the head of state we think ever wrote a positive note to a Jewish congregation\nIn it he said so much quote the citizens of the United states of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given demand kind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy a policy worthy of imitation all here possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship\nOr the agenda that seems to think Hillary Clinton should be the party spokesman once again because Elizabeth Warren has now no longer credible\nAnother boomerang that didn't work out for the left have you heard Hillary Clinton's latest this is what you get from the woman who said Donald Trump was not fit to be president before he was even sworn in [noise]\nHoney honey do you want to run again no [noise] no ties well I'd like to be president okay [laughter]\nTo the rest of course of the comments she made but no she doesn't want to run again she just wants to be president okay slip of the tongue OR Insight into her soul gone with the rest of the quote [noise]\nHopefully when we Abyei Democrat in the oval office in January of twenty Twenty one there's going to be so much work to be done I mean we're going to see this everybody in the world including ourselves and\nWe're confused our friends and our enemies like they have no idea what the United States stands for what will likely to do what we think is important in\nA cell that work with the work that I feel very well prepared for having that in a sad for eight years having been a diplomat or in the state department and it's just going to be a lot of heavy lifting are you going to get there in Dallas and failing oh I have no idea care\nBut okay so we go from no to a high of no idea and I'm not thinking about it all within a minute all within a minute\nShe doesn't know know then she recites her political resume to remind everyone why she would be so qualified from the Senate to being a diplomat\nKind of an interesting point she makes about our allies in a enemies have no idea what we stand for do you think that's right you think North Korea doesn't know what we stand for I think Iran doesn't know what we stand for I think they are less knew what we stood for during the ... years with the coddling we did of them\nDo you think our allies don't know what we stand for really I think they know a lot better what we stand for now\nThan we did under ... it was the president of Poland after all\nIn two thousand nine [noise] who said about Bach Brock Obama's European policies were going to have to start looking for new allies [noise] what a shame and what a quote to forget [noise]\nAnd what a sham Hillary Clinton those types of which will be Russia [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nNice sixty no\nCon male bombing suspects days are say off will remain behind bars for the findings she's accused of sending ... several high profile

day started to lose those gains and actually dropped about five hundred and fifty points on the Dow at his peak I think but towards the end of the day we saw a little bit of a rally back\nIn the markets I think to end up about two hundred and forty five points lower today still estimates additional losses after piling on top of last week's losses as well\nUm this volatility is is it seems to me like we're a bouncing a little bit off of some of the bottoms which starts to feel like we might be reaching a little bit of a bottom to this decline ah of course we never know no one has a crystal

was voted by her peers as a top doc in twenty Thirteen\nOne of her passions is promoting international awareness of breast cancer especially in countries such as India she has coauthored publications and a book chapter and his certified by the American board of surgery I welcome back Dr more the\nI think yeah All right\nSo as I mentioned at the beginning of the program today's topic treatment of late stage breast cancer disease\nLet's start off with\nThe beginning doctor Murthy give us the medical definition in terms of course of late stage or locally advanced breast cancer\nSayre says that the ... early stage breast cancer where there where this is diagnosed usually on a mammogram and it's not felt or a very small lump\nIn the sand or locally advanced breast cancer has features such as it is very large a perhaps over five centimeters has evidence that it spread to several months now than they are pet or soft tissues above and below the collar bone or to other tissues around the brass such as the skin and muscle\nAnd so it's important to make this kind of a diagnosis said that we can tailor the treatment ... to that individual\nAnd not there I Would say subgroup of inflammatory yeah as a locally advanced breast cancer is inflammatory breast cancer which is a rapidly growing type of cancer where the presentation is that the that you may or may not feel alone that the press appears red and swollen hence the term inflammatory\nCell it is a specific type of locally advanced breast cancer with unique symptoms are such as that skin thickening and swelling\nIs inflammatory breast cancer is that visually apparent\nYes says women will present with what\nAlmost A L I oftentimes confused with math site is and so they'll come in and saying you know what just pay recently my ... warm read it's swollen\nAnd they may or may not be a ... a lot of times when they do to their primary care physician they'll get placed on antibiotics thinking that it is an infection but there's no response to that antibiotics so\nThey well hopefully after after you know a couple of weeks have no response will get a mammogram and then be referred to a Mac oncologist or a

however\nHe did these candidates in those states don't do do do better than Trump they just need to do as well and ah this would be very encouraging and it also brings up the point that when you read the generic polls nationally when they say well\nThe Democrats are have this big advantage in the generic poll\nThe reasons that doesn't matter as much as you might think it would it's the same reason it didn't matter ultimately that Hillary won the popular vote by more than three well three million votes but you know what that was all in California\nAnd that's the point one of the reasons I think that Democrats may be doing well on the generic ballot there are thirty six seats where there is no Republican candidates\nReally where it's just so like I I don't think Maxine Waters has a Republican candidate against are there other seeds that are so dominated by the Democratic machine no Republican runs you know how many seats\nThere are no democratic candidates only three [noise] so when you

democratic theft machine at least that's the allegation in a new book by Eric eggers it's a cold fraud it's about election fraud and he says we're in real danger of it will be speaking to him later this hour\n[noise] um meanwhile I also want to hear from why this election is so important in the mind of someone who was speaking in Las Vegas just moments ago and it's a voice you might recognize listen\nNovember's elections are more important than anything I can remember in my lifetime and that includes what I was on the ballot\nPoliticians say every corner of the most important election\nThe stakes are high [noise]\nThe consequences of anybody here not\nTurning up and doing everything you can get your friends neighbors family to turn up\nThe consequences of news saying home\nWould be profoundly dangerous to this come to our democracy\nOkay\nI I Can't believe that Obama President Obama is saying uh this is the most important election of my lifetime\nAnd again everyone says that about every election and it's almost never true [laughter] really [noise] and this is a midterm election and it will not be a landslide one way or the other\nAnd yes I think it's important and yes I think everybody should definitely vote because this will help to determine the directions of the country for the next two years but then we have another presidential election and I think one of the things that happens\nIs we're all so desperate to get people to turn out and then went on election happens and there isn't some kind of profound change how people get disillusioned how often get new cry wolf about that stuff\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number a President Obama's successor was also speaking today and he had a a different tone he was speaking outside the White House and here's a President Trump said\nResolution [noise]\nSometimes we go we could have [noise]\nWe're giving [noise]\nSo every bit of that sort of the [laughter]\nTime to do both actually allowed\nOkay uh I'm not sure this is going to work\nAnd what he's talking about is trying to do a ten percent middle class income tax cuts sounds pretty good but honestly I don't I don't think he will get the support he needs unless a and\nFirst of all these right to say we're we're going to try to do the vote after the election what he's talking about now is a proposal to try to excite the Republican base in of course people should be excited about it to you know how much money you spend in taxes and getting ten\nPercent of that bag that's pretty cool that's a nice thing however\nHe can't do it honestly unless he finds some kind of compensating\nA place for money to come in\nBecause it it simply does not work it does not work when you cut the tax rate\nThat automatically the revenues go up I mean it's true that the revenues didn't go down from the last tax hike but because we're spending so much more than ... continue to grow up we're already looking at a trillion dollar a year deficit\nAnd I think the president should a work as far as he can maybe after the election with a Republican House and a Republican Senate to try to yes continue to cut taxes\nBut to do so by cutting spending one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or in Nevada President Trump spoke on Saturday and he was talking and somewhat similar terms listen\nReal if they are in fact for middle income\nThat it'll be sometimes I Wish I had are setting the right cell around the block for young people not at all and he's working on it [noise]\nAll right we're all we're you know\n\nI wouldn't say some time around for maybe a little bit before the\nOkay one of the things that we need to keep in mind is they're already was a tax cut for middle income people you may not be aware of it but you will when you fill out your tax forms and everything because basically the exemption\nWas doubled in other words part of what we have now is that the standard deduction the standard deduction that people receive\nWas doubled which means that there's an extra twelve thousand dollars that people who are middle class taxpayers are not paying taxes on\nThat's the thing and that should save a lot of money all ready for middle income people and uh I I think the timing of this I may be could be a little bit better\nAnd also President Trump does something that provoked a huge Lee negative response on CNN [noise] what's striking about this is not the light it sheds 'cause she has no light at all on President Trump's proposed actions concerning the federal government\nAnd trans gender is ...\nWhat's shocking about it is supposedly journalism and honestly these reporters on air uh are sounding completely an unapologetically partisan I'm Talking about John\nBerman and um [noise] and I'll Alison Colorado and a John Avalon on uh CNN listen to how they react\nRemember it was just over three years ago that same sex marriage became legal in this country\nSo now the wedge issue has moved to trans right and conservative so I'd love to mock the issue of identity gender identity civilized by Facebook's dozens of gender options\nI won't somewhat rules abrasive myriad of gender pronouns for many conservatives in some moderate it's a potent example the PC culture the Trump constantly attacks to great effect\nRepublicans want to benefit from this backlash and it's an easy target just look at the numbers transgender folks make up an estimated zero point four percent of American adults work once when I saw a million people\nThat's still a lot of our fellow citizens but it's many fewer than the millions of gay and lesbian Americans who most people now know was friends family your co workers\nAnd it's just simply picking on minority rights to try to win the popular vote last time I checked self determination was a pretty basic American values rooted in freedom and equality\nWell President Trump has also been playing up the caravan of asylum seekers from Central America pushing it as a threat at rallies and tweets with plenty of amplification from conservative media this is just more play the bass panic rooted in fear and anger rather than any reality that these asylum seekers are going to rush the border\nOkay there let's say they don't rush to the border\n[noise] what are they coming here to do they're they're coming here in Moscow to get into the United states and what they will do is flood our resources or submit applications for asylum\nAnd basically challenged this notion that the United states as a as a ... basically the core of our sovereignty gets to decide who comes into the country and who doesn't\nWe don't get to decide because we're not East Germany who leaves the country and people are free to leave\nBut this is this is bizarre this is um and we have that can we go to this last uh ... uh we don't have time okay ah I ah I Know we will be speaking about this later frankly what\nThat that's exactly right there was I think that the election it'd been settled by around three hundred vote and it wasn't until a couple of years later unfortunately what they discovered more than a thousand votes by I think spelling and people that shouldn't have been voting so that's a that's a very prominent example and by the way before\nAl Franken went on to become the sixtieth vote in the Senate\nSo anytime people ask well what the true cost of voter fraud I Would say well look you're a ride and insurance premiums because Africa is actually became the vote that locked in Obamacare are in New Hampshire and toys sixteen New Hampshire has a very weird policy about voting they have what's called the intent to reside law\nSo and I write about this in the book that the Democrats ... state of New Hampshire bill Gardner even admit this is a massive problem he's actually a champion of try to eradicate voter fraud in New Hampshire the senator from New Hampshire Kelly ... she ended up losing by one thousand votes\nIn twenty sixteen well they had six thousand people register to vote on the same day in New Hampshire and they had these buses that come in from Massachusetts the neighboring states six thousand people voted but then didn't actually register a car or take the follow up steps to suggest their actual New Hampshire residents\nSo those are a couple of recent examples but um you know but but some of the other things that happened I think\nThat document example you've got mayor's races you've got sheriff traces of the sheriff's rate\nIn Florida that uh it's basically been proven that they've had felons that voted illegally but because the elections basically been certified or the ... the judge has ruled that well we have to give these fellows due process though that's not enough evidence for invalidate\nThough it happened a nationally\nDon't change would would you say there's a certain amount of voter fraud in every state every election\nI I Would um because I think it really get down to the blowout in the voter rolls I mean and this is something we experience I live in Florida and\nI've been having numerous interactions with the elections officials here and elsewhere because the the reality is the bias is to let people vote right I mean no one wants to suppress illegal voter but\nBecause of that it's created a system of vulnerabilities\nThat I think are actively exploited by bad actors\nSo I mean the the Texas Democrats mailing the the voter registration forms is one example but you know you got groups like acorn ... and their whole job is to go out and Ralph's up as many voters as possible regardless of the legality of those voters right you've got\nVoted I I Know one ... one of the same way one singer\nOne of the things that people seem to be a interested in on the left as the idea that if you're a college student do you can register both in your college and uh where where you live and then you vote twice the national legal but that happens a lot doesn't\nAbsolutely I mean there's nearly three million people registered to vote in more than one state in the country or the Supreme Court side of the few that are specific that says twenty four million voter registrations this country are completely wrong so that's one an eight\nBy the way that we know we've got massive problem and then the question is will how easily are they exploited\nAnd you say you have to watch that we are going to face in just a moment with Eric Eyre eggers whose new book fraud how the left plans to seal the next election it's posted up at our website\nThe question that we're going to ponder is what do you do about it how can it be fixed how can we be protected we'll get to that and more with Eric eggers whose new book is called fraud\nHow the left plans to steal the next election will be right back on the met that show\nMichael ...

that at the outset so it's important to note that Ohio is done I think basically followed a template that other states would be wise to do it they\nAre taking steps to start removing would be illegal

allow them to continue to make sure that the people on the voter rolls were legal voters\nSee this is a very very important thing to keep in mind because when you think about cases like this a lot of people think well it's a matter of there's a conflict between two people and the government is sort of leaning on one side\nIs not a conflict between two private citizens it's a conflict between a

Mr Trump's already acceptance from the Saudi explanation that Mr ... was killed accidentally and a fistfight rather than orchestrated hit ordered by the Saudi royal court suggests how he plans to ride out the most acute foreign\nPolicy crisis in his presidency what this is the most acute foreign policy crisis of his presidency\nWhy is it a crisis why is it suddenly news that the Saudi regime is August and difficult and problematic in by the way President Trump has not said he said the opposite he's not said that he owed just accept what are the Saudis tell him without questioning\nWith the mid term elections less than three weeks away in a political base more focused on jobs the confirmation of justice Brett I'm capital why why people are focused on that because that stuff really matters\nAnd you're going to say well this mattered to ... but honest to goodness this is just an indication this outrageous piece\nThat what the Democrats really want\nIs they want to use this as a

I'm assuming some more will\nCome to know that a fact\nWe've talked about it here before and a lot there's a lot of it the distraction affect the constant state of agitation the no safe spaces from politics the permanent revolution if you will\nBut know what the revolutions base is it's a base of race it's constantly pushing the narrative that the GOP or the Republican Party or the conservative movement is all about a master race and preserving that master race look at Charles blows up at in the New York times today\nWould I truly don't know is whether he believes what he writes or not that is a serious question on my part I I don't know if he's a fool around have\nBut he writes the following Trump is campaigning as if it were quote white as if the quote white people's control of the country is in danger and under assault\nAnd must be defended and prosecuted at all costs protective sorry protected at all costs why would Charles Blow say or write or think that easy answer a lot of the left keeps writing and saying and thinking that why do they\nDoes it come with any evidence whatsoever [noise]\n[noise] I was hoping never to do this but here goes\nWith someone wanting to maintain something like the white people's control of this country have is this representative to the world has UN ambassador a woman of Indian descent what do you have as a surgeon general his lead spokesmen on public health an African American or black man\nWhat a secretary of housing and urban development and one of the two agencies most connected with managing issues of poverty beheaded by another African American or black man\nWould he have an Arab American as a secretary of health and Human Services the other agency dealing with issues having to do with poverty or an Asian American woman as a secretary of transportation\nDoes the narrative of a white people's control of this country come with any evidence whatsoever with a racist tolerate any of the above\nMuch less a point them much less love and promote promote love children who converted to orthodox Judaism but notice how Charles Blow of the New York times get to solve here\nHe continues to write quote but rather than ever using words like white supremacy white nationalism he uses proxies like law and order border walls and infestation\nWell let's stop a moment because infestation while not a racist term per se does claim some bells so who was Donald Trump referring to I looked up that quote I forgot it I remember when I looked it up\nBut he was referring to well no he was explicit lead using that word to speak of MS Thirteen gang members he called them investors\nGino who or what MS Thirteen is or does\nWell let me ask would it be better or worse to call the MS Thirteen an infestation or say panic\nWhat's worse say panic or infestation I asked because of relatively recent Washington Post article not all bad but article was titled MS their teens say panic history and a detailed the one of many examples of their crimes or I might just say methods\nQuote from the Washington Post the victim had been stabbed over one hundred times decapitated dismembered and his heart had been exercised from his chest and thrown into a great close quote\nYes infestation by such animals is probably if anything to weaker term so that's how Charles Blow portrays Trump racism use of the word infestation to describe something out of the temple of doom but worse and real\nThen Charles Blow the New York times writes quote any now wants to cast liberals and Democrats as mobs saying Democrats produce mobs while Republicans produce jobs will\nCount me among the mob if that means people who stand in opposition to Trump's degradation of the country and always close quote [noise] always blow writes\nIf the mob stands up for women and stands up to the national Rifle Association I Want it and if the mob hates corruption and loves the increasing diversity of this country than it is for me close quote he does not know\nWhat he's talking about or what Republicans are talking about\nWe're talking about violence the violence that leads to include shooting at Republicans shoving Republicans or other protesters throwing projectiles at them antifa rioters\nThat's what we're talking about\nI suppose I suppose blow could be joining\n... joining that if all in all ways as the standard for protest here if he truly thinks that that's what protests should be put something tells me he's missed tend the leftist missed something really big\nYou see I think as I think we all think revolution is justified in certain institutions see the declaration of independence for cross references oh heck\nI'll do a forum we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed\nThat whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to Institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness\nPrudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are suffer rubble\nMentor right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed\nSo what's interesting here to ask is what just what form of government has become destructive of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness [noise]\nTo the degree that argument can be made it can be made by may be some in the conservative community and indeed the fuse it used to be a fairly standard trope of\nThe left but the radical or separatist right is what was to be feared in this country but what has been their effect none\nSo why else might have group resort to violence or ...\nWell the eradication maybe even the curbing of civil liberties quick question a person is less free to speak or right today or over the past two years ... make it over the past ten years only one kind of person the conservative\nHe is who was banned on the college campus or violently attacked he is who was censored on social media\nIndeed so free as the left to operate in this country as it should be that Michael Moore just released a feature movie but there is the exact Rob\nIt doesn't have purchased the movies a flop people aren't seeing it because they aren't buying it just like Hillary Clinton just like the rest of the left wing agenda of hypocrisy power just because you don't like an election does not mean you get to be far inland\nJust because you don't like an election to the point the violence means you are the separatists you are the ones who despises your fellow countrymen and as it must be a few despise your fellow countrymen you have to despise your country\nJust because people don't agree with you does not give you the right to violence something we thought we all would have learned before the first grade\nThat is of course unless you are a fascist or a communist who rules by that power of muscle\nAnd gun of course those two are the ones who divide us by claims of race so the shoe just makes it\n[noise] but you know you cannot claimed to love the symbols of American democracy or any form of democracy is thriving of such and boys a thriving if you want to put her to center with means that are violent\nPropaganda arm of the Democratic National Committee\nThat's what we have\nWe have there is some Fox new gets higher ratings political stuff you know than anyone including the network news organization [noise]\nYeah well yeah no I Do I just I'm Wondering are people looking at

son is ... okay uh-huh\n[laughter] he was the question what this does some guy\nMaybe the following statement out how\nHow can these people\nAre just want to stop people from trying to better their lives\nBe so selfish and like myself I\nUnderstand what you're saying you know how can these people walk better their lives now and they're not selfish but these people want to keep it alive lives better and don't want it\nWorse there are selfish yeah and I said\nBut doing that argument is used every day on CNN and MSNBC and ABC\nMhm [noise] and he's like wash [laughter]\n\nHow can we be so cool not allow anybody who wants to come into this country to come into this got\nIn any way anyone [laughter] okay [laughter]\nAnd then in the same breath say you can't disparage the countries that are coming from a wonderful country they're not as holes yeah yeah [laughter] yeah they're fleeing from\nThis always reminds me this point you know my buddy Chris Buskirk makes a really good point about this part of the argument which is um when we do\nRelax our borders or immigration policy or however you want to put it in this discussion uh two people are fleeing or coming from these countries voluntarily or otherwise\nUm does anyone ever stop and think about the consequences to that originating country does anyone ever stop and think about what it means to be quote unquote strip

Republicans including this one\nWho has talked about the problem of overspending and then it just pulled the Ryan and Republicans rose to power in two thousand and ten in part by right raising an

spoke effectively talking about the craziness that has infected so much of the left and the kind of craziness to which his opponent beta or work is playing listen\nYou are right that there there is a

all the doors of the Supreme Court\nFor our country we can disagree will fruiting each other with respect will treating each other with civility\nOkay I I think that some fat ugly true\nAnd part of that incivility or appeared on the um on the Internet this morning right after the debate where the ... people are packaging what you're about to hear as some kind of why\nAnd and by the way your film even in the theatrical release had a tremendous impact and the proof of that is\nBusiness Insider just a compiled a list based on information from the critical aggregator met a critic\nAnd they were asking question which has always been a great concern to me which is what's the worst movie ever made and uh my brother Harry and I have done books about that but uh they came up with a list I'm Seventy five\nOf films that were the worst ever made\nThe a six worst film ever made according them was Hillary's America your film\nAnd the worst film ever made was this new film what is that what the hell out of the nation that led a little critics all of them are left wing by the way I mean well virtually a hundred percent what is it about your film that you think lead people to designated as the worst film in history\nI think quite simply that when you imagine a left wing critic particularly somebody call is over the paintings are really the result of emotion dog parks in like that\nWalking into the theater and seeing\nAll of their basic assumption just put ... overturned and done so in in ... intellectually powerful way I mean I don't know how to respond so they're very discombobulated and angry and when they leave the theater there\n... or ... how do I ... and they don't realize that the way that they can get it is by writing a review that says I agree with the movie but I don't know why\nOr I don't have good arguments to counter this but they say extremely boring movie where it will be ever made couldn't wait to watch the first ten minutes so\nThis is the way in which it intellectually and emotionally immature people\nWere on when their world was over time\nI look I I think there's a great deal to what you're saying because I recently Michael Moore came out with his new movie Fahrenheit eleven nine\nEr and er this is a movie about supposedly about Donald Trump and how he's ruining American is the end of the world and the movie had tremendous hype it had very good reviews though not so much for me and a and it proceeded to bomb Mayes he's actually going to end up reaching a fraction of the people you reach with death of America\nWell the thing to realize is that Michael Moore problem with the ... of it is back in Studio give him the money to make the movies he's on every talk show he gets old severed republic pretty whereas I only\nI mean it's my movie with mentioned on ABC NBC Phoebe out\nA little worried about it from CNN or MSN keep the ... yard at not covered at all so good luck to sort of they they go out of their way or the film and yet despite all that and Michael Moore by the way opened seven hundred with theater we'll ...\nTheaters and we did about a famous the opening weekend and it will be ... like a stone\nSo it had years kind of guy and that makes the heart of it is that look I'm not making the point here on the ideological acts like\nMichael Moore first so a a a which was a clever little the NFL Bush's case there are adequate she quit at that point\nYeah well the point about this new film I Know you haven't seen it I have Michael Moore's movie didn't ashes movie death of a nation or you can stream right now at death of a nation movie dot com\nBut the other point about Moore's movie it begins almost identical to your movie except your movie covers the materials so much better it so much more ...\nAnd it's actually very funny the way you do it what you do at the beginning of the film is you go back to election night and you show the change from the beginning of election night where the anger is the beginning they are all happy and excited they are about to welcome the first female president and Hillary of course is going to win\nAnd then you show the increasing desperation and heartbreak as it becomes clear that the result wasn't what people expected\nMichael Moore does the same thing but he doesn't play it for laughs he plays it oh my goodness this is the beginning of a nightmare and a tragedy and it's not watch of all\nI'm ... in terms of my response to the film the one segment of the film that I think is most unforgettable is your amazing ah interview with Richard Spencer a leading a leader of what people call white supremacists neo Nazi American opinion\nExplain what you found out that was so groundbreaking it's a real revelation an eye opener in the film death of the nation\n[noise] well I was thinking to myself I'm Michael that it's one thing to say that historically the Democratic party the party of racism or the Democratic party had a fascist going going back to be a Ninety thirties if another thing to say where is the racism today\nAnd on the left would seem to have a Trump Card\nWhich is that basically look at all these white nationalists Charlotte's red light and so on and so am I going to a Compaq certainly make America great again hat so clearly a white supremacy now is on the right\nOkay but people are going to see this for themselves because what they find from Richard Spencer is that no he's a left us he's a socialist he's somebody on the\nLeft that's one of the revelations you'll get when you go to death of a nation movie dot com it's

for my good friends that leaves and hopefully you are having a fantastic day to day and enjoying this whether my gosh you got out today or to drive\nOne of my children's school and it was Chris and beautiful maybe it was yesterday or day before it nonetheless it's been fantastic hopefully are enjoying this transition to better weather better outcomes now we have football this year but we also have elections\nThey're right on us in life happening in in candidly this has been a wild and crazy election cycle we know we feel it\nWe saw the heat up and everything that happened during the two thousands sixteen elections\nAnd the emotions just ran wild ... we saw people in the right people on the left people tearing into each other really saw a lot left to ease with their great tolerance bumper stickers and coexist in kind of flame out on everything that they stood for because they do not like\nDonald J Trump and they have a passion against him which is really secrete a special boy and I called like the loser the land and what happens sometimes when people losing the big bad way they have is claiming their brains called the loser grant bland\nAnd watch the creed sex chemical they can never find their way back to rational thought or distinct rational arguments and I believe candidly that's happened now we'd given some fodder for cans\nWe've allowed people to get aggressive and we've I'm giving them some things you don't get some are like this have said things are done things but at the same time\nWe're working for the best possible possible outcome for this country now you've heard me said a million times\nYou've heard sets it you'd heard Chris it you've heard other commentary talked about it how there's this point of irrational behavior where it turns people off and we're seeing that\nNow today is going to be a really cool show we've got a number of different guess they're going to be with us today and in the next to our we have Mike Noble who is the founder and principal of ... predicted\nYou've seen a lot of point that's been coming out right everybody starts to look at the polling they tried to get to these predicted what they call them predicted analytics\nWhere they're trying to figure out who's really going to win the election if any of our state wide candidates is going to be the Senate races Martha McSally allegation is scarce and send them again when what's gonna happen to the gubernatorial race in eastern looking across the nation are we going to swing\nRight do you think that the Democrats are going to pick up the majority in the house I'm really actually curious what you think as we get through and we start working out through cells to this conversation that want you to engage in this conversation because\nThere are definite and clear signals signals one way or the other and I'm curious how you approach the signals of even field a mercy them so we'll go into that in some detail so kind of hang tight because I think that's a big question a lot of you have is which way this house going to go\nI mean again if if the if the Democrats pick up the house majority you know immediately the following day or when the seats kick into place when the at the turn of the year you're going to have them do what they're gonna teach\nDonald J ... remember impeachment by way of the word is just the beginning to the house the Senate they don't have a chance and heck\nThey're going to pick up the Senate but that's where it dies just like it did with President Bill Clinton when he was impeached and just that word going along I guess it kinda fits in a sense because of Donald Trump's and beat up called everything since he's been ah the president and then the the chief commander here of our country her commander in chief\nAnd it it just it seems apropos in a way and maybe it's a good way to finish it off but I Want to tell you one thing is I get nervous because I Want to have the policies the process of the successes that we've had with the president's agenda to keep pushing forward and what happens here in our house in our state\nThe Senate here in our state the house and the Senate and the national level if they don't line up with the president is not the same party a lot of times it can swoop policy down to a crawl and sometimes it doesn't even happens so you can have a great vision from the current president\nAnd because of the house is no longer in control the Republicans are just stopped right there\nNever advances for it and then that's where you get aggressive presidents like President Obama with the executive order and starts doing things that just made all of our heads kind of spin you start to see the agency step and more aggressively and that's not good for Americans the right way is the vote for people get them into office and then make sure we have good outcomes in right now we've had\nEvery opportunity to articulate the fantastic vision that fantastic principles and values a Republican president brings to better jobs better economic growth\nBetter safety more protection of everybody's religions more freedom for the concept the media doesn't like the fact that he's pushing back on 'em and they say things like oh he's infringing on our freedom of speech wrong\nFreedom of speech doesn't mean you can meet all liars it means that you can talk and be openly share ideas and such and not worry about getting your head came to it\nSo we come back we've got Mike Noble coming on we've got a a candidate for secretary of state Republican candidate Steve Gainer you got to hear him you got to get people out there to vote they put the full court press on we'll talk to the numbers of what the left is doing Soros fires\nAnd the other is trying to pick up that seat and the pound on them the best they possibly can get is critically important that we protect it and do what we can and I get over that very very very first time\nI saw again making sure that we have good outcomes and making sure that we're absolutely\nCapable of winning and turnout is what it's all about last thing that all kind of step into is that in our last hour toward then Corey Lewandowski\nPresident Donald Trump's primary candidate her campaign manager will be joining us and we will make sure that you hear from him first and you see the outcome and ultimately what is um in store for our nation he's got a very different perspective as it relates to\nEverything and so as we cruise through this and as we make sure that we are lined up properly he's going to give us a perspective from a national standard a lot of times we get in this little myopic little box here in Arizona\nAnd we don't find our way to the best information and so when you have somebody like Cory who touches on all the different elements he gets a different perspective he feels that he sees it see one of the things about politics too it's not a perfect science\nAnd so when you see somebody processing through the information it's pretty it's pretty overwhelming sometimes to try to do it yourself but when you hear somebody that takes very complex concepts and dies him down to very specific simple ideas for us to listen to you\nThen you started to go okay I got it I see what's going to see what's happening and I see what the outcome is going to be like\nSo again making sure that we get to that point is critically important and I'm having a best best best possible are now going back to everything when we look at what's happening in the White House and we look at the headline news today if you go to political you go to\nFox if you go to the hill Huffington Post\nYou go to a Financial Times all of these different publications take a look at policy politics\nFinancial environments everything that they can to try to report now do you think people spin information absolutely they do so one of the things that I've made a habit of doing it I Would encourage you to do is not just become academic on the issue so we're talking about trade\nIf we're talking about foreign policy for talking about other elements of national defense and stuff where should read about it right get perspective that we can on a more the academic standpoint\nAnd then when it comes to arguments when it comes about making decisions on day to day basis it's critically important important for you to know how policy is going to impact you but also how are people spinning\nWhat are the conversations that are happening on the left or right if you go to the Huffington Post and you start to kind of walk through this and look at you know what they're doing reports and they and they go right through the headlines and and um it'll be\nPretty telling to see which way they spend if you shoot over to the hill you get a feel for which where they're going to spend just by their headlights you go to Fox same deal you go to political same deal you go to the hill and on and on and on and the thing they don't want to point out to you is that recognize you've got to put your felt drawn to some degree\nRe read it listen to it maybe there'll be some videos that are attached to give you more clarity on factual things that are said or done\nBut then you get a return back now a Garcia so you've got Garcia is running for governor here in the state of Arizona against governor Doug do seem\nNow what's really interesting for me is that when they had this last debate if he didn't see it governor do see kept referencing certain points of information about David Garcia\nAnd Garcia says that's not true and\nGoing to do see what did he say go look at it yourself fact check Garcia dot com fact check Garcia dot com and you can see yourself so when that debate was going on I had my computer my lap I pulled it up looked at it and and David Garcia's words own words he said exactly what ... does he claimed did set\nThere was no like cut on one side cut another side splicing things together it was one continuous speech that he was talking about\nAnd to the audience he was speaking to us probably appropriate in a sense where he was pandering to try to get votes so maybe a little hard line on this little more hard line on that but nonetheless it shows it in the lack of integrity of that particular candidate so when you see things like video it's great because then he got\nHe really did say that Oh yes the Billy Bush video down Trump there is no sugar coating that right he said it and nobody ever said he didn't say that\nFrance to meet with them for a year they've got that call pretty

stepping in and it's a good time I Love talking politics and what's happening around the world\nEspecially with our economy we've got John to rescue the John how are you sir hey Robert good to talk to you you as well how are things are happening around this wild and crazy economic world Luis we've we've seen the changes and I feel like we've been here before\nWhy spend a little ... saw the past couple of weeks I've been talking with Seth about this of course markets up and down pretty uh\nUm you know big swings we've been seeing yesterday the Dow was up five hundred and forty seven points but today we had a little struggle it was a whip sewing back and forth between positive and negative\nFinally ending up slightly down today a but we're looking really had a few other er into indications here we saw a oil or making it a pretty big drop and and it's a price per barrel down below Seventy dollars\nA finding that we've got us crude stockpiles are\nMore than we expected which is a good thing right this is going to keep that price of oil down which have the issues going on right now with Saudi Arabia who potentially is saying they may or do a little manipulation with oil prices so it's good to see that we've got a lot of stockpiling up our own\nAnd we would be able to probably work through some of those issues if anything happened on that and\nUh also looks like the president is finally talking about a budget and trying to cut spending and this is a good thing I don't know if you saw this article about the president's talking about each cabinet secretary slashing their budget by about five percent as he pledges to cut spending\nYeah that that is a music store years all of us I think the the gross spending and they needed spending is crazy that's sort of see somebody said things like that and then I Believe him you know the one thing yeah right on drug ... says he's going to do something to do that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show",

history of black supremacy on Jews or on white people or something like that so there are different impact of that\nI I agree I agree and again I I think it is obviously much more serious if somebody in public office say is\nSaying something that is negatively racist then if somebody like Louis Farrakhan of saying it however I think people were right to challenge President Trump when he was a candidate for office about support he'd received from David Duke because even though David Duke is a joke\nA loser and a creep and a former klansmen and a former leader of the Nazi Party and all of the above a she she still it to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone respectable\nIs a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan because if you look at Farrakhan history of just a cop Khamenei anti American hatred of his own country\nThe idea that he should be on stage as he was that Aretha Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from a former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd uh I Do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe he is a racist but you you simply can't\nAll of a sudden sale because Louis Farrakhan his old at\nThis point and because he associates himself\nWith um with with black people and as a representative of black people than anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill deserves some kind of sanction go ahead like yeah I\nI I understand that Michael connected one more point go\nOkay so my point is that where this is coming from where they misled or in my opinion a a black people who are you know very hatred of the there have full of of whites where it's coming from ... in a kind of a revolution are fighting back\nAbout what happened to them as a people over time whereas\nThe other direction when it was the Nazis or whomever they wouldn't have packing people not because they did anything to them they made up conspiracy theory and made up that these people were doing stuff against them ... it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians and the Turkish genocide against Armenians one of the justifications\nFor that genocide which was real and it happened and and also make knowledge of Iraq and so the Armenian people were a cruel to the Turks and they were undermining the it doesn't matter\nIf you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group based upon ethnicity or

hundred percent of the media I mean it's it's complete garbage\nOh okay so so I take Fox News for instance in who runs uh MSNBC\nAnd okay at first of all Jews do not run either of those networks you

you ever heard of News Corp [noise] ah no I haven't\nNews Corp is Rupert Murdoch's company does Fox News and the wall Street Journal and the New York post and a bunch of other end by like find company

eight\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number this came in from Jake in Seattle Jake writes in pretty sad to hear you get on the Mumbai train\nI was saying that I think it's post totally legitimate to say that one of the tactics the Democrats have used in this campaign then is unique to this campaign\nIs basically dispatching mobs some of which we understand are affiliated with organizations that are well funded\nTo disrupt Republican events to get into people's faces to ah basically misbehave and contributed to this atmosphere of violence and confrontation\nJake says pretty sad to hear you get on the mom trained I've never had much or any respect for you well thank you are but I thought you were above that\nWas anyone calling the Tea Party protestors in two thousand Thirteen a mom\nIt's a talking point Michael and you can't be above that nonsense if you partake in it okay\nHere's the challenge to you out there and I'll take calls on it can you give me an example where any of the Tea Party sessions acted like a mom\nWhere they tried to show someone down where they tried to disrupt something I mean when you're talking about mom to think about those code paying more ons\nWho continually continuing continually it was literally several times in our disrupted the Kavanaugh hearings who flooded congressional offices one of the hallmarks of the Tea Party and I saw when my own eyes\nThese are people who clean up after themselves they would've giant rallies and a giant march on Washington one that was run by Glenn Beck I think that two hundred thousand people there that a ton of people\nAnd they made a very big point of asking people to pick up their litter and you can compare that to the inauguration crown\nOr any inauguration crowd you cannot compare and the same way\nThat very very regularly or there would be people dispatched to conservative political rallies and he asked this includes Trump rallies to try to disrupt them to shell out and be carried away\nAt it I won't say it never happens but it's very rarely happens with liberal candidates do you remember a time when when Hillary was forced to confront angry people\nChanting it her or President Obama\nI I Do remember there were a couple of cases where President Obama had a heckler any handled it very well in very classy and fine but it's so rare\nAnd uh again right now in this campaign\nYou have major political figures like the if the Democrats take over the house of representatives Maxine Waters Los Angeles will be the chair of the house committee on financial services it's big money has to do is regulating banks\nMaxine Waters is openly said that it is appropriate to act like a mom and to get into people's faces Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine shell I'm\nTed Cruz and Heidi have been basically assaulted at dinner we played the other day or a segment of Ted Cruz being assaulted at the airport just the lack of decorum the mobster tactics\n... that's what we're talking about and it is not equally distributed you cannot find current examples about that that are prominent\nOn the conservative side of things\nLet's go to your calls to Jake in Philadelphia Jake you're on the man that show disagreement day\nWhere Michael I disagree with your you have a term anti Semitism it should be anti Judaism and hatred of Jews and their religious\nWell no uh because of Hitler made a a very big point of killing people including people who were Jews would converted to Catholicism uh there there is a saint of the Catholic Church who was a former Jewish communist intellectual\nAloe what Hitler's friend or the semi the mafia of Jerusalem\nOkay right I ... I understand but the term anti Semitism was originally coined in Europe in central directs\nBy a hold on hold on and it was coined by people to describe a hatred of Jews and you're right the Jews have been European for a long time but this argument about a ... whether it is it real anti Judaism and it is it is not a\nReligious argument that goes down to religion\nIt does not go down to religion you heard that I I'm ... I'm Sorry sir they are from the church it started from the church fathers okay it it\nDid not start from the church fathers had started long before that if you read about the book investor which dramatizes events in the fifth century bc\nLike pharmaceutical drugs\nWhat scared to do that and I didn't want to become reliant on it so with a combination of therapy and smoking marijuana I Am recovering\nI'm very happy for you and I'm Glad to hear it and marijuana is legal medical marijuana has been illegal for\nA long time um but you said and you're right you didn't want to become dependent on some of the pharmaceutical drugs shouldn't you also be concerned about becoming dependent on marijuana\nYes I actually am that is a concern of mine um however I proven to myself I'm a numerous times that\nLike I'll go I'd I'd gone through ... fans in the past ... years of no you and then I you her cage and all and then I can like turn it down that OK early when I Do use I use it right before a therapy session I adore\nAnd and again and you're you're getting medical and psychological attention and and that's good and I hope everything should continue to be better for you ... the basic position that I Would have on marijuana is is simply that being dependent on anything\nIs not great uh I think people get very dependent on alcohol I was reading a they have a thing in the New York times I have a advice column called sugars and somebody was writing in and asking for advice\nOn saying what should we do our children are are talking to my wife and myself children are nine and seven and they say hey mommy and daddy you drink too much\nAnd he said one of our kids said at the other day when my wife was having a second bloody Marriott month at lunch\nOkay and of course in the answer to them they never said you know maybe you do drink too much I mean it's and it turns out that they have a family history of alcoholism they got to be careful but\nThe ideas looked life life has all kinds of challenges and sometimes it does make sense whether it's with marijuana or with booze certainly with opioids or any other kind of prescription drugs anything\nDon't make things more difficult for yourself then is absolutely necessary let's go to a Lauren in Houston you're on the Michael ... shows disagreement day\nHi Michael I and my ... today is that we should be hoping our fifth Saudi Arabia why\nUm because it's carrying on hundreds of thousands of Yemeni people it's bad and it's not a good influence for the United states towards other countries\nUm an because he already has jeopardizing live in farm okay what what what I think what we were media elite is taking our influence in our leadership position in from other countries\nOkay Lauren and Lauren what do you think would happen if a President Trump all of a sudden it's announced okay okay uh we're canceling this arms deal with Saudi Arabia where they're buying a hundred billion dollars worth of our arms that we make here what what would happen and you think they would get their arms from somewhere else\nI sure am\nI absolutely they would they would probably get them from China or Russia and a ... again what have we accomplished ... I Do I Believe that Saudi Arabia's a problematic country I think it's a corrupt and brutal autocracy is a very problematic country\nBut do I believe that it would help the United states to completely alienate ourselves in the end a working relationship with Saudi Arabia Thomas Friedman is a big liberal wrote a find peace in the New York times yesterday\nAnd that piece made the case that look we

heritage it's no different than you claiming to be Jewish\nOh really I'm not a U.S senator and I've never tried to claim any advantage to identifying is Jewish as just who I Am it's the way I was raised he writes the name ... Eastern European that's true ... means bear in Russian\nAnd it's also means bear in check I Believe Hungarian a Serbian I Believe a bunch of Eastern European languages a I'm On the bear walks like a man\nNamed ... he writes his Eastern European it is not Middle Eastern in origin well that's true but the most common church names are Middle Eastern origin Goldberg which is a common Jewish name they were all taken a during the exile\nAnd again and this is all pretty well known Jewish history\nUnless you believe the twelve tribes of Israel came from Europe no I don't according to my knowledge of the Old Testament Abraham the father of Jacob actually ever had was the father of eyes they it was a grandfather Jacob Abraham what was the father of Jacob who fathered twelve sons which became the twelve tribes of Israel that's right\nWhich upon entering the promised land God commanded them to commit ethnic genocide against the pagan is well no not exactly a commanding them to kill men when children obese and burn while also burning down orchards et cetera a Holocaust by all measures okay so what's the point\nI Would pay for you to take a DNA test Richard says no problem I'd also bet you a thousand dollars to the charity of your choice if you can show you have more than thirty percent Jewish DNA you know I might take this that\nI might take this bad for the record my grandfather who was an immigrant from Germany his mother I understand was from Poland grandfather told me his mother handed down to him a solid silver Menorah which I have a very good memory of seeing as a child during the holiday season it was always placed above his fireplace\nThere were never any Christmas trees and grandpa was house this Menorah there was handed down from his great great great grandfather to his mother does that make me Jewish\nAnd you're faithful listener Richard okay Richard ... it it does not make you Jewish because you weren't raised Jewish you've never affiliated Jewish you've never been part of the community the point about Elizabeth Warren that was so stupid\nWas that she never participated in any American indian life she was never registered with any tribe there was no tradition of Indian culture in her family\nI can assure you and I have three brothers who can help proven or even though my parents weren't devoutly religious when we're growing up they were extraordinarily committed to Jewish life\nOr my parents are in fact when I was six months old took me to Israel for the first time and we do know because my mother's family had lived in ... Germany for many many years my uncle my great uncle Julius had actually traced back to the families lineage\nTo the fourteen hundreds and an old Jewish Jewish Jewish Jewish but you see this is this is not the point there are all kinds of convert to Judaism including members of my immediate family who have limited Jewish background some but limited Jewish background genetically or ethnically\nBut they choose to live as part of a Jewish community and specifically they choose to live religiously\nAnd this is really the problem with Elizabeth Warren is she was claiming to be a diversity hire at Harvard\nShe had put this on Harvard she'd even contributed to a cookbook done by the Harvard Native American community called powwow chow\nAnd her whole identification\nWith Native American identity was phony I can assure you if someone's been a synagogue president for Fifteen Years or in a prior life my involvement with ah with Jewish life and Judaism is pretty well documented ... by the way

Democrat he was Jerry Ford's UN ambassador\nOne of the ... one of the few in memory who we will remember based on their distinctive use of the bully pulpit on behalf of American interests and standing up to nonsense and authoritarianism his book about that it was called a dangerous place\nHe meant the world was a dangerous place but his double entendre was that the UN was too\nWell littlest changed very little just this past week the human rights council of the United nations selected such members to it as Bahrain Cameroon Eritrea and the Philippines countries with sewer scores when it comes to that which they are to a judge human rights\nOther current members of the human rights council include Cuba's Saudi Arabia and Pakistan [noise]\nBoy who wouldn't want them uh judging human rights violations the point is these are countries that wouldn't no human right if they saw one or more would immediately suspend and violate such rights if they were ever to surface\nOf course the critical world word in all these things is not really the word rights but human he abusive humans the abuse of civilization\nSo today I saw Joe Biden condemning Donald Trump on television for being too cozy with dictators including Saudi Arabia I have no problem condemning Saudi Arabia I've been doing it for years and have large portions of a book I wrote some years back where we spend a lot of bank\nOn how terrible or countries Saudi Arabia is in fact some of you may know my Cajun will use of the phrase sewer country\nI don't know if others have used it I haven't seen it before from anyone else I don't think but the first unusual time I use that phrase is in fact in order to describe Saudi Arabia a sewer country\nBut who and Alice Joe Biden to condemn Trump for our relationship with the rabies\nWas not Iraq Obama the president who bowed to the Saudi king\nAnd the Chinese premier and one of the billions of dollars handed over to her on a country not only responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans but a country that is killed thousands perhaps as many perhaps as many as six thousand people\nFor merely being homosexual death by hanging in Iran Post revolutionary Iran\nAnd speaking of human rights abuses where's the Democratic party on the worst forms of racism I'm of course not talking about idiots who march from time to time and groups of dozens and claim Erian superiority\nBut the tens of thousands rallied to the racist incantation ... Lewis fair can\nLet us not forget that just two months ago Lewis Farah can was front and center on a stage with Bill Clinton Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton\nThey were truly paddling around before they even got on stage smiles and shoulder grabs and all Farah Ken Sarah can [noise]\nHe has said such wonderful things is quote say ten of Jews have infected the whole world with poison and deceit close quote quote to Jews have control over those agencies of government when you want something in this world the Jew holds the door close quote quote Jews were responsible for all of the filth\nAnd degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men and women women into men\nWhite folks are going down and ... going down and Farah can by God's Grace has pulled the cover off\nThe seed panic Jew and I'm here to say your time is up your world is through\nYour good Jews better separate because the satanic ones will take you to hell with them because that's where they are headed close quote quote it is now becoming a parent there were many Israelis and scientists Jews and key roles in the nine eleven attacks Israelis had for knowledge of the attacks\nWe know that many Jews received a text message to come to work\nOn September eleventh close quote\nI was just a few samples and from this year not the distant past well over the weekend there man fair can compare Jews to termites he also put that comparison up on Twitter\nTwitter will not remove Bill Clinton will not condemning him Jackson and Sharpton sure won't well anyone in the Democratic party\nWho cares about human rights civil rights decency and who play capes voting blocks not with dog whistles but embraces the jackals like Louis Vera can\nMeanwhile think about what the left did to Kanye West for supporting not fair can with Donald Trump is mental health was made fun of he was called the ... he was called the house negro he was called an example of what happens and blacks don't learn to read\n[noise] beautiful stuff isn't it [noise]\nBut ... is I think and was I think on to something as Victor Davis Hanson rights today the provocative Donald Trump's certainly seems to be disliked by a majority of African American professional athletes cable news hosts academics and certainly the Congressional Black caucus yeah\nThere are subtle but increasing indications that his approval among other African Americans maybe reaching historic highs for a modern Republican president\n[noise] some polls indicated that Trump's approval approval rating among black voters as close to twenty percent that is far higher than the eight percent of the African American vote the Trump received on election day twenty sixteen [noise]\nA recent Rasmussen report poll shows African American approval of Trump could be as high as thirty six percent even twenty percent of African American support for Trump would all but dismantle Democratic Party presidential hopes for twenty twenty\nHillary Clinton lost the twenty sixteen election was eighty eight percent of the black vote that was about six point fall off from Brock Obama share of the black folk and twenty twelve\nBut far more importantly an estimated two million of the African American voters have cast ballots for Obama in twenty twelve simply did not show up at the polls in twenty sixteen to vote for Hillary Clinton\nBy the way they think of what Kanye West could do on the campaign trail for Donald Trump put those two million non voters\nBut why is the supposedly odious Trump having any success and undermining the traditional marriage between African Americans and Democrats most recent job report revealed that the unemployment rate for African American teenagers fell to Nineteen point three percent the lowest figure in history\nThat number stands and market contrast to the twenty ten rate forty eight point nine percent under the Obama administration think about that Nineteen percent forty percent\nOverall black unemployment is currently at five point nine percent which is close to a record low\nUnder Trump the economy is growing it nearly four percent a year the robust growth coincides with Trump's efforts to curb illegal immigration and imported labor the net result has been to empower minority job applicants and ways not seen in nearly fifty years\nTrump's implicit message is that every American worker\nEvery American worker is now crucial and maintaining the red hot economy\nIn a job shorter ... laborers suddenly have a lot of leverage over their employers and wages are rising\nTrump should stress other issues that might appeal to African Americans as well such as the rights of access to charter schools and how boutique environmentalism and overregulation drive up the cost of affordable housing fuel\nAnd electricity just so\nIt is perhaps true that we're at once thought may indeed come to pass that Donald Trump could be some kind of post partisan Republican president changing traditional partisan voting blocks that time could be here\nIt very well could and not just with African Americans but perhaps even with females of all colors and Jewish Americans\nThink about what you could do with those votes that con you could get even half of them even half of them well and that's Michael the dean would\nPeople who participated in the million Man March in Nineteen Ninety five headed by ... which really made

condemn a look at\nChelsea Clinton your credit whatever way condemns or aren't remarks I Wish I could have done it because what is next to Derek on at the funeral of Franklin and he has a special obligation to so I think silence there's not an appropriate response to a fair cause very well\nAnd in fact Allen I'm Mr Khan has referred to Hillary Clinton as wicked woman you can hear her to Hitler as well so you're disappointed that we haven't heard from black leaders but you're also disappointed we haven't heard from democratic leaders as well\n[noise] I'm disappointed that whole nation people had been universally together\nOr to condemn it there is a social obligation just like this special obligation to the both the extreme right to condemn the oil price may in cages anti Semitism or bigotry special obligation to people on the left of black leaders\nDemocratic leader so out of their way to condemn this because there is a fairly large following right and many voters to vote Democrat so there's a special obligation\nTo condemn those who are speaking on your side of the issues but why don't they [noise]\nI guess the fear of losing the base or you know there are many voters and some people are more now\nFrom what I was a dark all his um Gary's can become swing voters and people don't want to lose their state we're seeing other Republicans I was struck Republicans route fishing condemn you just watch them as voters every American as we get together and say we don't want you know different about this is\nThis notion of be All right as being in any way comparable to Louis Farah can uh it it's it's it's simply first of all I don't know how right the alt right is if you've seen diminished as soon as this movie looks like it's probably more progressive and more left wing\nThen or anything having to do with conservative second uh made me made me made me a a a charismatic or well known leader of the ... right as I say\nThese guys get together occasionally and can someone dozens\nWhen Louis Farrakhan wants to he can summon tens of thousands and that would have included Brock\nObama that his million Man March is certainly included Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and Bill Clinton\nIn August at a rate to Franklin's Juno but silent silence on what's the silence of these people it's incredible the second and a triple a third standards that they apply this incredible ... can talk about ... something up and it's headlines for days\nThis kind of thing or just love to fly and Bill Clinton stays silent and Nancy Pelosi stay silent\nAnd Chuck Schumer stays
