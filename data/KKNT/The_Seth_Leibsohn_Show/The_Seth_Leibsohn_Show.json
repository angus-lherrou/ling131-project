San jose Jose or San jose it's crazy this number the highest placed by house right now I think median median sales prices like one point to or something or I heard I can tell you you need you need two hundred and Seventy four grand yearly to buy a house there on my gosh minutes while\nAlso rates versus home sales um we're gonna be talking to also a little bit later in the show if you're thinking about selling your home and you've seen the commercials and the billboards [noise]\nYou know about people a point and click you know quick sales don't leave ten or twenty percent of the sales price you're home on the table\nI mean Josh if you look at it fell on your home let's say your homes worth three hundred thousand right I don't want to let everyone know you're in a million dollar home but let's say a home for three and ... and I'm just curious why not saying it's a little more than three hundred K. but let's say your homes or three hundred thousand would you want to leave thirty to sixty thousand in cash on the table\nNow absolutely not and I'm ... now this this is considered the buyer is that you're talking about yes and I buy are right correct I heard that term all the time well you ... seconds I can bring a real life scenario to you I brought a guy I met a guy on line through a lead on that I had purchased\nI started talking to him he was in Chandler\nI'm told me hey you know I'm looking to buy a home I said well what are you into with your current house he said hey already habits old I'm ... I'm not gonna say it was ... he goes I'm I'm a net about Fifteen grand like perfect that's enough for a down payment on your new home mhm he was he was right about the two Seventy five range of evidence new purchase\nBy calling me back like four days later after they ... after he had gotten more into the process mhm and he called me up and goes hey you know I Can't I Can't do uh I I I Can't tell my home to and I buy are anymore they came back to me and I I'm leaning that about a couple of hundred dollars [laughter]\nWell here's here's this here's how it goes okay so when you do one of the point and click here's an offer for your property and twenty four hours\nWhat happens is they start out with an offer initial offer may seem fairly reasonable K.\nSo then they kinda they kinda have you hooked so then you're like okay that sounds good probably excited oh yeah yeah I sold my house here's what I'm going to get so here's what happens though is then they come out to your place [noise]\nAnd they drop the old seven to twelve percent commission line Anya so they're like well here's were originally going to offer you but then there's also commissions and which by the way seven to twelve percent is quite a bit higher than what it would be if you're hired\nJason flush it results realty to sell your property so I'm doing a three hundred and twelve seven to twelve while okay so the normal real estate agent is six percent total three percent to the selling agent right page of the selling your home and then three percent to the buyers Egypt that brings a buyer if there's a buyer right\nI'm being represented by a by his agent so anyway they're seven to twelve percent\nAnd then on top of that they're going to look at your property and say oh you know what the whole needs to be painted landscape needs to be updated there's all kinds of the floor needs to be read them so then they're like we need to take another Fifteen twenty grand it could be even a lot more than that depending on the how distressed property actually is right\nSo it's just one thing after another here's what we're going to offer you now we've got seven to twelve percent commission now we have\nYou know items that we need to update on the property so next thing you know you're just so yeah so you can follow me so even after that the increase in in a commission\nThey're going to come in and take more of your profit huh exactly gotcha that's how it works ... soldiers you think the average after everything said and done percentage wise of equity\nThat you're losing a guiding it tend to twenty percent for well here here's a great example here so a home that I sold an ultimatum said oh year and a half ago a lot that er it's nice it's neat\nSo it was on fountain drive that particular property in the end the cells or the the cellar on it I Know very well so what he did as he called to the bigger ones open door offer ...\nAnd the net effect of it is he would have gotten from open door was two hundred and sixty two five I Believe okay offer it was like two fifty nine so they were very very close [noise]\nWell I put it coming soon sign up and said I'm going to listen for three thirty three thirty wow okay but I ended up selling it before it even hit the market for three hundred and thirty thousand dollars sweet it's All right there so\nHe would have left literally close to Seventy thousand dollars that's a little over twenty percent on the table now does he call just to see what they were going to do or is he has no he he calls he's one of those guys that that covers every base so he called\nAnd checked out you know a couple of different places you know because he sees it all over the place he sees them advertising on TV\nThe billboards and he's like I Wonder what they would give me but then he was smart enough to know hey that that something seems off I've known many years and I told them three thirty and he goes really he goes that these other guys are offering me such and such I said so they even talk about it so they low ball the even offer\nThey did and well the thing is is open door home mean all these other companies out there that offer the point and click right there in the business to flip homes thinking about it\nBecause all they do is they buy your home they put a little bit of money into it your money into it to fix it up as a seller and then they put it back on the market and sell it and\nYou verify all of this it's all on the on the list\nNo absolutely and then um I was talking to a group of retailers yesterday they are and one of them ... points as low as now dabbling in it mhm and uh between open door um Zillow and what's the other one ah [noise] open door Zillow Africa for\nPat from may ... of last month's um sales they almost a made up four percent\nJust under ... percent yeah for enough and and to me that's a that's a small percentage of it is yes it's a lot of homes you'd think it'd be the way that people talk about anything it'd be a much\nLarger right percentage right right and that's why all these realtors out there that are all up in arms stand there and all these point and click right companies these I buy her companies you know they're they're gonna take it all over no there there's no replacement for face to face working with a professional but does this every single day and can get ... dollars for your own\nYou know and you'll you'll only people that I've like I said if I have actually gone through with that it's been a very special situation for him you know I'm\nLike I have I Know why I close a deal on the by side where they had a very short time together house the property was really run down ... and they had a ton of equity no\nTo that and I mean in that situation for them it made sense and like she said that's a four percent of the very small percentage first so you know for someone that situation that might make more sense they don't have the time right I mean that might be what some people\nDo that well they do a lot of the hassle but I think a lot of people think it's a hassle right they think it's a hassle when in reality it's really not right\nSo the thing that I that I wanted to get across and we've been doing this radio show now Josh what Fifteen Years now we have the real estate power going and the reason we do this just to let people like that and know that there are other alternatives to selling your home I mean gray go out and get the price from them right\nThen give us a call and really see what you can get I mean why what'd you just answer this question right now why would you want to leave twenty thirty forty ran on the table\nThat's that let's let's answer that question on the air that someone who's in that situation and needs to sell their home really quick mhm could you could you remedy that we can remedy that as well absolutely or as a matter of fact ruin your\nPool of ... um you know ... your network of investors and people that could fix the police up real quick sure investors okay we\nGot one right now a Rand McClintock ... contract I was looking for the contractor sorry well yeah he's a subcontractor which is fine\nI'm over it rained McClintock so we're helping a a oh a gentleman out there Bob and marry the nicer yeah\nFree people their home has been rented out for many many years it needs to fix up oh so it's in the middle of getting fixed up right now so with the combined effort of both Bob\nHis wife and then myself getting the sub contractors in there the painters flooring fixing things up the home's going to be ready next week Oh nice and I don't charge anything for managing it you know the the seller pays the subcontractor directly\nSo there is no middleman so if you're home did does need some fix up\nIt's not that hard to do so you're just managing it yes what do you charge you for that nothing what rhymes with hero what zero model yeah some other place you don't do anything for nothing absolutely I Do absolutely ideal you check out our Web site at age CSI results real T. dot com click on the before and after years you could see\nProbably a hundred homes on their latest homes that we've done before and after is on\nSo how long do you think that from you know have they called you up marrying Bob and until list from the time they said hey we want to do this to the time will actually be a market just for people out there listening thinking hey that's it takes three months to get my house ready\nTheir particular property which needs it needs a lipstick remodel from top to bottom two weeks and that's probably most homes that people think oh this I Can't do this the ones that the ones that would take us you know a couple few months and the ones where we got to pull permits maybe there's some additions that need to be done\nWhere you're actually moving plumbing in a home so some of these homes in the middle of Phoenix and historic districts that\nYou don't have that galley kitchen and you want to remove some walls inside and really open it up where you actually need to Jack hammer and the foundation and move plumbing moved kitchens that would take two to three months\nI like the the analogy lipstick huh lifted\nWritten about it really is\nInteresting that's good stuff man really good stuff we got off on a tangent there but a later in the show I thought that's that's an important topic it is a lot of people there I mean you pass billboards and see it on TV you know what I mean it's been a lot of money in advertising\nLike back in a in a in own nine and two thousand ten realtors were like\nReal estate shocks I'm not doing real estate of the slowest it's ever been\nThat was the best for me oh nine and ten was the time to buy homes yeah\nI mean that was the bottom

it's the worst time right now that's usually the best time to buy right it really is so back to your point in the holidays\nI Love it because there's less competition with real estate agents actually out there working I knew this fulltime let's face it Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of the license real estate agents which there's fifty or sixty thousand of them in Arizona right\nThere is only a

December eighth man is going to be a a big change with Fannie Mae so\nI Would say get in before that change [noise]\nI'm just thinking right now let's say someone got in well let's say someone bought bought a home in mid November but they don't close till mid December can they lock into that earlier interest rate before December eighth or how does that work\nSo the the interest rate yes the interest rate will be locked in say now it works\nAbout a different version of underwriting so if you're if you're a mid mid uh you know if you're if you're not closing prior to December eighth\nYou're going to be susceptible to that new version of underwriting ... right yeah so\nLike I said you know if you're you know conventional financing starts at six twenty cycle minimum\nNow if there's ... it's not often that you're six twenty six Twenty one then you're going to run approved for for a Fannie Mae loan unless you're putting him ... big chunk of money down and kind of thirty percent now that's and that's not it's not doable but that's generally speaking right and\nSo ... you don't see approvals until closer up to you know and everything's different but six sixty six Seventy six eighty ... for for a conventional loan but like I'm saying if you're saying that six Seventy price you know fight go you're only putting five ten percent down and you're running approve now that might change after December\nSo you know a lot of in a lot of lenders out there may not be having that conversation with their buyers\nSo info yep and like we said before the holidays this ties right into a do it now yeah good time [noise]\nArizona versus the rest of the country yeah how much income do you need it and this is interesting because we talk about this quite often we have an ability throughout the nation\nWe talk about that quite often and and you know the reason I the reason I bring this up is because I was talking about um you know interest rates on the rise right and that that's a big you know kind of drawback to people wanting to buy right now our rates are going up I'm gonna I'm gonna wait right well you know I I tell people that it's probably not going to happen\nBut you know homes in Arizona and and that's why you have a lot of people flooding here are still very affordable mhm right so I'm ... on on average okay this is the national average and will break it down by cities are by I'm Sorry by states and then take Phoenix for the national average to buy a home across the United states\nIs I'm just over sixty one grand household income right doesn't seem like a lot but we are talking across the board you know complete average right yup by the ... the man everything everything right so ... and actually Arizona so listening out there are people in California maybe investors\nUm or people relocating the minute median income combined household median income to buy in Arizona is just over fifty five grand\nWhich that's not that's not crazy right I'm\nNow in the flip side of that like let's talk a San Diego right median come there and we're talking all homes hundred and thirty not that you you kind of expect that's getting up there getting up there right [noise] um let's talk New York ... and now this number kind of trips me out but only a hundred and four\nYou know what I mean wow yeah I'm surprised that is a you know maybe it was anyway but maybe some real housing that it's got to be cheaper yes um Baltimore was a sixty sixty seven to a Washington D.C.'s is up there in Ninety nine Ninety five\n[noise] um this is a crazy one Cleveland, Ohio you only need to make thirty nine thousand to buy a home in that area\nRight Josh you want to hear something funniest back in back in own nine and two thousand ten I remember we're talking about what it would take to get into the median home price now this was the bottom of the market oh nine and ten and I remember that the money you had to make was like twenty four thousand dollars and\nI remember being like twenty and then jumped to thirty three right now now we're up to fifty five ... oh yeah [laughter] and and I will say is I mean I don't say little state but our our state's growing a it's a great it's a great place to be I mean the weather is awesome\nAnd you don't have to make two hundred and Seventy five grand a year like you do in San jose and Kim household income to buy a house in San jose ... that's the highest on the list\nWhile no two Seventy four that's your neck of the woods [noise] it is I just sold that I sold ...\nUm [noise] some folks ah\nI don't want to say their name but there are they lived in white wing and are they both had jobs in San jose so they're working remotely and then he was ... a lot so he worked for Apple\nAnd that she had a tech jobs out there so they they sold their home and white wing and then moved out to San jose I'd you know what they bought I Do and they spent two point seven million on a home there that was twenty three hundred square feet\nOh how much was a square footage and the house here in Wyoming\nA little over five thousand or actually six thousand six thousand square feet foot yourself for a million eighty there you go and look at the difference oh yeah and that nuts I mean the affordability is just is the difference in affordability is insane\nI mean even though there are parts of the country Denver's booming Ninety Ninety four thousand to buy a house and you have to make that much money to buy the normal house in Denver\nCrazy well and there's a reason that a lot of people are relocating right um yeah transferring jobs out here\nGot a good buddy I went to high school with that just moved out here a couple a few months back okay over in the east mark ... so the home that he was in in San Mateo in on the peninsula their right worth a bit over a million dollars distressed\nOlder home what do you mean when you say distressed distress meaning that it still has a lot of the original Nineteen seventies I mean it's still had the little known Liam force from the seventies [noise]\nAnd he's an aircraft mechanic for American Airlines oh I Know you're talking about yeah so he was making such and such amount out there\nAnd he got a twenty thousand dollar raise to travel out here dude right and he bought the home for three hundred and four thousand deaths I remember Iran spanking new great guy and he ... American airline guy yeah Rick yeah\nSo I mean there you go and he just loves it out here or does he love it or is about if he was going to like it out and he moved out here in the summer and he goes I absolutely love it nice you know so I'm not out swinging a bat and hitting in baseballs in the street you know in the summer\nBut now I bet he loves it right now oh it's probably remind them the weather back on his motorcycle cruising around town just went to high school you know we didn't nice stories there are there's a couple of handfuls of people that I went to high school with that live in Arizona now I mean all the way out from Glendale in Peoria\nTo the far east valley out towards go canyon so they're they're sprinkled throughout the valley\nAnd it's funny hearing from them on what the initial perception was of Arizona like what people say that have never been here ... have never lived here oh it's too hot it's just the desert there's nothing there there are there and they're you know what I'm saying it's just a dirt and sand here just kicking dirt but then when you come out here and you're like well\nThere's more golf courses per capita than any other ... around you know a a\nThe affordability as their restaurants they're on every corner like all my friends from the bay area\nThere's like one or two restaurants they go to all the time ... and the iron gate and that is

edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affect each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you that may not know Dr ... he is a nationally recognized authority unnatural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThey are it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nA while you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects their body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this I'm On a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress hinted tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in their in their upper back and you fill Italian is right and the doctor I'm more concerned about\nThe muscles that you don't feel that test that most of the arteries and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles\nIn and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nHealth and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people do you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurts more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia\nAnd cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement or how many ... ... it\nHas to do with simple absorption calcium beginning absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYeah OK yeah it does build your teeth but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates and your blood\nSo in that one percent drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidney their organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones and self\n... orbit back from the bones if ... that's right but I say\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen yeah\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nFor sure just drink milk just\nDrink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy a house which started right right right but these things don't absorbing the body\nUp for a couple of reasons one when you take a let's say an antacid that has the calcium in it like a dumb first of all calcium absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the end the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nBut comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences that the powder\nAnd what happened to put it in hot water and you mix it up and drink it down so in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that's also a problem that well\nYeah because when calcium and magnesium earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact is I'm I'm reading the can right now says the fans to absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium it takes a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications you need sleeping pills the calcium and especially the need is being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all the things\nMy comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body\nCable news all the time quoted all the time uh people tended to be staffers either and in ministry Russian or\nFor a um [noise] for a congressional committee or a congressman or senator or worked in the whole staff or would have been by definition in the administration [noise]\nUm sometimes their pollsters they can just say wrong things on and on and on over the years and prognosticators gifts wrongfully on and on and on over and over again over the years\nUm and never go away and they keep coming back they keep getting contracts or to be um [noise] on call for the for the for cable news the contracts are pretty hefty uh they're pretty good\nI've ah seen some of them and you know there's just no accountability ever for being wrong or I guess for being stupid\nUm and the latest I think goes to Bill Kristol a someone who's decline and fall over the years um and by over the years I mean two or three somebody put it longer I'd put it at about two or three\nUm has just been I think embarrassed to him an embarrassing for him and sent to watch a first I knew a bill\nHe was some writing serious academic works you know he was a professor at Harvard PHD student and political philosophy student of one of the great political philosophy professors of our age men in Turkey Mansfield [noise]\nI'm doing doing good writings on the federalist papers and\nPolitical philosophy and then started work in the Reagan Administration and a than a little bit in the Bush to administration the first Bush administration sorry as chief of staff to Dan Quayle\nAnd then he of course founded the Weekly Standard magazine which did a lot of good humans work early on I think it would be unfair to say singlehandedly responsible but one or\nOne of a a few handful of people and institutions that we're almost singlehandedly responsible for defeating Hillary care [noise]\nUm but of late [noise] it the decline has been a both a precipitous and set to watch uh over the weekend he declared\nThat a\nLot of Fox News personalities or should resign or be fired from Fox News he's taking on Fox News\nSays I'm a free speech person and I'm not for super ... I'm not for being super fastidious about calling people to account about things that are set in the heat of the moment\nBut at the end of the day I think Fox with its evening line up Fox Business with Lou Dobbs the routine stuff that have said they're people who work at Fox the management of Fox the shareholders Fox the corporate board a Fox really need to look in the mirror and say we're comfortable with this [noise] we're making money but are we comfortable\nWith this ah and he said this in context of um the Pittsburgh massacre when he's talking of the evening line up at Fox it's interesting who would be talking about who would he be talking about Tucker Carlson to be sure Sean Hannity to be sure\nI'm the only other one uh that would probably qualify will be Laura Ingraham who used to work for Bill Kristol by the way as did Tucker Carlson they both used to work for Bill Kristol Tucker at the Weekly Standard and Laura Ingraham at the department of education\nHunter William Bennett and uh so special call out I'm sure to both of them\nAlong with Sean now I don't watch them every night\nOr or even most nights but I watch them a fair amount and I try and catch a lot of their stuff after it airs especially if they have interesting interviews I I I I don't know of anything irresponsible that they should be blamed for and I think this is our main problem with people like Bill Kristol\nWhich is when you have a platform and it is a gift to have a platform it as a gift to be able to be paid attention to for your thoughts and opinions\nAnd you are a quote unquote conservative are quote unquote Republican why is your fire always trained on your own team is it because you actually believe it and if so then let's examine those beliefs\nBut I don't know how you can examine these beliefs in the context of the crap CNN puts out and has been putting out steadily and more and more lately so I don't think it's that is it too cozy up\nIs it to get a better contract with one of these networks and MSNBC let's say or a CNN notice how much they liked to have never Trump Republicans on their payrolls\nNotice how much they liked to praying about having Republicans on their payrolls but then when you examine these Republicans on their payrolls it's hard to find any of these people ever saying anything that looks remotely like\nSomething the Republican Party believes in or could come out of the Republican Party platform because it doesn't these people are liberals\nWho have a far and longer go far left the Republican Party and the conservative movement they just haven't changed their registration\nWhy [noise] because if they did they wouldn't have those gifts\nThat's the dirty little secret here if they actually change their registration and call themselves Democrats\nThey wouldn't have those gigs and why wouldn't they have those gigs they wouldn't have those gigs 'cause they're just not as good at the leftist democratic stuff as the leftists and Democrats who have been doing it for years are\nAnd they're not to be trusted that's why that's why but as long as they can maintain\nSome semblance of an inherent to the Republican Party or a recent past working relationship with the Republican Party [noise] boy that's part of the golden revolving door of Washington DC to it's not just becoming a lobbyist folks [noise] getting these really good six figures contracts with cable companies [noise]\nLook at what CNN Mr crystal if you watch it and I suspect you don't [noise] because you spend so much time blather about [noise] if you watch CNN [noise] do you see it is so much worse I'll give you an example of that and we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThe constitution is under attack our country is at a

or what you and you know a grade school middle school and high school out here and what was your high school it was desert just an homage to thousands alumni okay and uh shortly after high school I ended up joining the United States Navy honorably served from two thousand two to two thousand and tune and move\nInto does NATO was severely wounded in Afghanistan fighting with marine says they are as a hospital corpsman\nAre you comfortable talking about that battle a little bit we had I think our audience would like to hear it Yes sir sir\nSo uh you know my unit we we took a lot of casualties are myself being included um altogether we last night the Marines one corpsman in one interpreter and in a pond getting home we lost thirty additional Marines and sailors to suicide so I'm an owner say about a hundred and\nEither a hundred and sixty a hundred and thirty of us were end up uh being wounded and I'm thirty ... including myself is just\n... we went through a lot I'm I'm not going to light up the plane that was a it was a rough deployment\nSo rough deployment did you sign up for the military because of nine eleven or\nI did so shortly after nine eleven um I was talking to some buddies of when we wanted to do something about what took place I mean an attack just happened to our whole home soil and so I'm a handful of my buddies returning to the army I wasn't comfortable with army so I started going to the other recruiting officers in the navy what's a good comfort level for me\nGiven all the water we have in Arizona the navy seemed like a natural for you [laughter] I'm after Afghanistan and when you came back home tell us what you do what you did than\nUh I was wrongfully denied by July which is an acronym short for a traumatic servicemen scoop life insurance as well as Social Security or the benefits and so I'm not only that but my parents were traveling from Phoenix to San Antonio where I spent the first year of my recovery and uh they spend a little over twenty five thousand dollars just on flights and travel alone\nBut at the department of defense the marine corps navy weren't offering my parents and you kind of travel assistance or any any of the wounded love forms of family members and so\nUm there was that family piece that's that struggle and then my my piece my struggle was the benefit side of things so Christmas of two thousand and two

wings for Anthony was a fundraiser to help pay my mom and dad back it was actually our our local church growing up here in Phoenix so wings for Anthony raised a little over twenty five thousand for my

themselves but the families and their caregivers of those uh those veterans and there's a lot of a healing heroes is what we like to call them that need some additional assistance sometimes that assistance could come straight from families so what wings for warriors does is a\nUm we we provide insights tools and resources to where the worst as they go to the ... a transition into a new realities which would be\nGoing back to school building a family's starting a family um [noise] there's entrepreneurial ah programs as well that we're we're providing to them but really it's a it's just resources that's mainly what we do\nJames Madison talked about democracy here\nWorking because of auxiliary organizations or something to Tocqueville picked a theme he picked up on later all God's Children have work to do so whether you Don the uniform or not if you want to help those who have served our country wings for words is a great place to help\nAnd you guys aside from being able to take any help on line you're having a a big gala coming up as well November right\nIt's a Saturday November tents which is the marine corps birthday and a day before Veterans Day so a perfect perfect data habits um it's it's called a night of honor and giving so that's exactly what it is it's a night to honor the veterans that have given so much to our country\nAnd again the website I'm going to let you give it out as much as you want if people want to go to the scale our help out\nThat'd be great yeah we're just encourage people to attend so that they can be educated on what's going on in the military family and caregiver but mainly the wounded warrior communities across the United states and do although we're a Phoenix based nonprofit are we are serving in twenty eight different cities\nAnd that they would like to attend or purchase tickets to the game or they can go to ... dot org\nWings for warriors dot org or like Web sites that tells you exactly where to go and where they are ... keep it simple that's great what would you communicate Anthony ... so many of us are so supportive\nBut we now live in a I'm In an interesting time where I don't know a generation ago everyone either if they didn't have a family member in the military they certainly knew someone who was in the military that's not the case anymore not only is um is is the difference between those who serve and those who know people who serve\nFarther and farther apart it's getting even farther and farther and worse um by the year and hopefully not by the generation about a year\nWhat would you um what would you tell people who have not had much if any contact with those who have done during uniform uh ... what what what do they need to know and what would you say and encouragement for you know them to join\nFirst thing that comes to mind is a don't be afraid to ask questions a show that you're interested um a lot of people I think are quiet and stand on the sidelines especially to those that are in uniform whether it be the airport or in public or at like a special sporting event or something to that effect or don't don't be\nYou know I'm just saying thank you even though you think that that's all people say that it's just sometimes like a U.S never enough up or just give him a hug shake their hand and just say thank you we know what that means yeah appreciate it every time\nThat is good and you know you went through um some of the hardest stuff anyone could ever imagine though you went through it you still encourage people to um enlist or join the military if that's or something they are at least in in the slightest even interested in doing\nOr without getting without getting political sure ah we've always been in the ... men so someone's going to need to step up and sign up and do it and we need the younger generations to get up and fight 'em there's a big sense of pride in that and I think that our country is a very powerful country and we need the ... citizens of which to protect us\nAnthony as someone who has been to Afghanistan who has fought for the country there and as this war has you know gone on for as long as it has what would you tell people who have not taken a deep dive into what's going on there or haven't looked at it and a long time\nWhat would you what would you have them know about that country and uh our our deployment there\nI Know that's a big questions related question in a it's going to be at a small tiny little answer on not everyone's bad\nThat there's there's good villages um there's bad villages and I'm\nJust like here in the states there's always the bad eggs that unfortunately represent does the the the grander population I get the attention that get the attention right because it's negative and so um my experiences there we're not we're not truly um\nPleasant there'll be a word I Would choose to use your but um\nYou know someone asked me recently actually a similar question but they said that you have any happy times over there yeah and I really couldn't think of an answer you know it wasn't until after I unfortunately lost the opportunity to answer that woman\nBut uh my wife was sitting right next to me one night we were watching TV and I got a text from an old marine and it was all of us messing around when when we had a little bit of down time which we didn't get all the time right but during that downtime we make we make the best of it right and so I did have some happy times with my Marines and sailors why we're over there fighting\nAnd do you um ... where where do you plan to go from here you've been doing humans work for wings for wars it's a great organization do you yourself you said without getting political do you yourself sometimes think about maybe getting a getting into politics or doing something in public policy on this front\nHere no no no loyalty to really good point because you know the other thing that's lacking was talking to our guest Anthony not only about [noise]\nHow we've created a new generation of people that are so disconnected from the military you know uh it sounds like you're old enough to remember a time when if a family didn't have someone in the military they knew someone in the military and that's just less and less and less the case\nAt the same time something else tragic is going on Harry right and it's in our education system which is where you went to which is interesting to me just we just don't learn about\nYou know we just don't learn our history anymore we don't learn about the sacrifices we don't learn about the heroes saw on TV there's an outing Murphy week coming up I bet there's no one under the age of thirty who knows who are Murphy's\nCorrect and and that and that is a scandal that is a scandal and it is a harm it is a harm um it it's a harm to our children it's a real harm to our children\nI was a young person during the second World War there I never\nSaw anyone who was in Riyadh and for the car you know\nAnd uh it's a different time now but thank you for doing what you're doing so we couldn't remember these folks uh I'm I'm eighty four and I've seen a lot of changes and that's ... well you keep up the good work we really appreciate\nHarry I appreciate you more than you know thank you sir I appreciate your call and I appreciate your comments all God's Children have work to do as I said whether it's in the military or something else worthwhile but his point\nThat Harry made a and that we talked through about not only the disconnected missing the generations um between you know military and the non military\nUm it is something that I keep returning to it seems I Do it about once a month maybe twice a month and probably could do it more and it's about the way we teach in this country and what we what our kids knowing what they don't know\nUm it was the theme Ronald Reagan struck the strongest in his farewell message it was a it was the same about not\nKnowing um our history anymore and I'll play a little bit\nOf that when we get back and they don't want to read you some testimony the great American historian David McCullough gave\nTo the United States Senate on this um I think you'll find it I opening at the same time as I think you will find it tragic um basic point is and we have this discussion a lot and we're having\nNow again a with regard to illegal immigrants as I'm Serious an issue as it is and it is and we're all about it\nIt's important to think about the aliens who make of our own children we make of them aliens to a country they do not know fifty percent of them graduate with an F in American history or below basic score in American history it is their worst subject and that is just\nAn intellectual crime on so many levels [noise] talk a little bit more about that I didn't know we'd go here but it's fine it's important to six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\nNine sixty no matter what your caller nearly five

so thank you I'm delighted to be back here\nFor um as I said the last time I was on the program trends was established in Nineteen eighty two I went to work for the newspaper at the time\nIn Nineteen Ninety four and then subsequently purchase it at the end of two thousand\nAnd turned it into a magazine and we cover all the society things that happened in Phoenix pretty much\nFrom the end of October to the end of may and it goes to twenty four thousand readers when you do a lot of good charitable work too I like to point that out as well to each other we have a very great foundation and they do most of the majority of the work I sort of just\nOver ...

charitable fund dot com either one\nPerfect thinking ... sorry no that's fine that's fine now we do movie talk here you wanted to do a disaster movies but before we do disaster movies before we get to it I have to play you some audio that I think will be some surprise audio for it you know I Hope you like this because the last time you were here build you have or what I Want to hold that just one sec\nLast time you were here you and I talked about one or two years in the Academy Awards which portrayed\nJust an amazing distinction between the kinds of movies Hollywood used to be capable of putting out this and ... the kind of what's the word I Want I think ... they put out now in direct might be Iraq a rising tide of mediocrity [noise]\nUh I took one year which I liked which was um [noise] Nineteen sixty three the movies of Nineteen sixty three where you got all in one year you got Lawrence of Arabia the longest day mutiny on the bounty to kill a mocking bird\nThe miracle worker um sweet bird of youth bird man of Alcatraz Billy Budd this is a days of wine and roses this was all one year measuring candidate all in one year right that unbelievable unbelievable the host that\nYear of the Academy Awards with Frank Sinatra us he opened the Academy Awards with this have you heard it I was hoping to surprise you with it it's fun even if you have maestro take it away\n[noise] before we get on a big one I'd like to take this opportunity\nSo to speak so just to say as a way to fix it is I Want to have a little tired of all of the talk of editorials called what's wrong with Hollywood unquote sick about airing of run away for\nThe U.S has cost the star system and how we need to go in the subsidies I Know\nAnd you know we need to ... and the way to get pictures are rather\nRather legally headed early in the evening if you get back into the Mona Lisa ... individual pictures had in a fashion chair individual picture ... committees\nAccountants lawyers office boys ... is really the real estate ... by ...\n[noise]\n... going through all those paper on your front lawn\nAnd when you turn to the end the famous section they will be an ad which raises a best picture of the way out about the rights that are now to help us write it\nWe decided on a friend's house lifelong in Tokyo\nNaturally we had a choice of all of the French housewives on and so [noise]\nWhat's that show also asked the winter we\nHad a daily level first of all listen to each his own and then the virus got 'em in the Soviet\nWasn't that fun that was less than that just have making good picture as\nWell and I have to say to only Frank Sinatra could say this because if somebody disagreed with him he'd have their legs\n[laughter] making good extras I Love that I just thought that audio is fun and what a great wind up to introducing Olivia to have on this disaster films you want to talk about why do you want to talk about disaster for his I think that\nThey're very profound I think that they really shaped our culture in the Nineteen seventies and made us aware of things that we had really never thought of or experience before and I really think it was just completely earth shaking and very culturally significant you made me watch\nSomething I'm not you but because I knew this was the topic I decided to watch some to bone up on a couple I haven't seen and I guess it's fair to say that disaster movies really did start in the Nineteen seventies as best I can tell\n'em I don't know if we can precisely defined them maybe it's so you know when you see it [noise] but I took to uh watching uh the Poseidon adventure\nUh the towering inferno\nUh I'll think of a couple of others I watched those two would certainly be amongst the first to anyone would think of wouldn't they\nI Would think so I think earlier if you look at 'em Arthur Haley's novel a airport airport we ... we all watched airport was really I went back and I researched airline disaster movies of the Nineteen fifties and sixties and they really showed very little\nAbout what took place in an airline disaster\nRoss Hunter was on the more with the decompression seen an airport you watch that and it's it's terrifying now is it was in Nineteen Seventy one van half one went into the restroom and let the bomb\nThat was terrifying and you know who knew van half one would end up looking like [laughter]\nIt's very well no not a it was one of his last pictures has had to have been a no we watched airport one of the things that was interesting about that movie uh well you know all of them frankly is how much slower\nThose movies are there out they are also action movies how slow them to build up is compared to what were we got used to in the eighties and nineties much now it's a much so you have to have a lot more patience airport is not an action movie\nNo nah it is sort of a disaster movie [laughter]\nIt is indeed well everything is so quick reflects now we want everything instantly right films have to be faster than they were back in Nineteen Seventy one airport was produced and good old marine Stapleton Airport a shoe who was his wife right at scene you know when\nShe sees the seven to seven pulled back from the terminal and she realizes there's nothing she can do and she just stands there heartbroken knowing that her husband as a terrorist I I still get chills I think it's one of the finest scenes in movie ever\nIt is and there's another scene in there which\nStirs up so many things in me it's the scene of there's I don't know if he's a famous actor or not but it's the character who's complaining about everything I think he complains about stale not just [noise]\nAnd um he's the guy who ruins the whole thing to see I have a theme in life or be where the dampers it comes from a Canadian novelist be where the damn person cynics in society\nUm they're bad this guy is nothing but a damper on a complainer and when the team or on the airline on the airplane the team puts together a really good plan\nTo take the bomb away from van half one is its in its brief case\nThis guy interferes interferes my you can't take this man's property and\nYou know that just trust the authorities the distrust of the government the cynic the complainer the Mr helper it's All right there and that guy who ruins everything well it it it builds up with a complaint about fell not costing lives\nJust and then of course there's the famous scene where the gentleman comes out of the restroom and van ... jumped in and the guy who's complaining goes grab him he's got a bomb\nThat's right freaks out the entire airplane he twice ruins yeah\nHeck of a cast Burt Lancaster dean Martin Jacqueline beset George Kennedy\nI'm Helen Hayes who always looks like that I mean that was just classic killing Hayes obviously a marine Stapleton and Gary Collins people remember him as a talk show host us but he was that like third flight attendant of ... third pilot\nHit so big and the seventies because Americans realized for the first time yes eight plane can have a mad bomber on it yes a cruise ship turnover yes a high rise ... can cut catch on fire and yes there can be a big shark and a big\nEarthquake I read somewhere I don't know if you have any recollection of this but I read somewhere that the initial making of jaws the initial ah the the initial screenwriter kept talking about a whale kept talking about a whale ... kept having to tell them it was a shark it was a shark shark\nI have heard that and um people didn't know much about sharks until that book or a movie they really didn't know all about so now it's amazing to think about the people really didn't have much interaction or thought about sharks until then\nMy first interaction with sharks um the Brophy family had a large home in rocky point and there was a coffee table book I think it was written by Jacques Cousteau if I'm not mistaken and it was called blue water white deaths and it was about great white sharks will\nWe flip through the book we looked at the color pictures but we never gave it any thought until that winter I Believe it was Nineteen Seventy four when the novel jaws came out that would be about right the movie was Seventy five spellbinding yeah spellbinding\nIn it changed the way everyone looked at oceans forever more or\nBeaches I should I think anything I mean I've been a swimmer all my life and I won't swimming in the open water now because of jaws right I don't even like the deep end of our swimming pool\nNights but that's the\nImpact the difference with Charles as opposed to the side and eventually the towering ... people will go into big buildings after the ... watching the towering foreign oh gosh knows why\nAnd they'll go on cruise ships after the Poseidon adventure and they won't think about those movies but I don't think anyone goes into an ocean without thinking a little bit about the movie jobs just a little bit\nI think you're right I think it stays there permanently on your head just a little bit think of how long ago that was now and it's still a say over forty years us absolutely\nRight absolutely right talk to me about the towering in far for no\nThis was a heck of a cast this was a real cast Fred Astaire to Paul Newman to go for\nIt on and on I mean it was ... I think that Ross Hunter with the success of airport established the all star cast where you just loaded with Academy Award winners and seasoned veteran actors\nMcQueen Steve McQueen Irwin Allen did this with the Poseidon adventure and then he just hit pinnacle what the towering inferno to pair Steve McQueen and Paul Newman together who had been complete arch rivals who most people\nAssumed were almost the same person they had such a similar look\nI Do have a similar though did he ... he must have died shortly thereafter\nSteve Steve McQueen died in Nineteen eighty OK okay lung cancer we had a few more years smoker um he he tried that Africa ... craze thing do you remember that thing yes and I might mayoral or lead to rile where they thought oh yeah yeah indeed\nI I think of as Harry inferno the performances were fantastic I think some were better than others you and I toss when we're off the era of Robert Wagner ensues and plan or you know\nI mean ... when they discover after sneaking away I Believe the pretext was they were both supposed to be up in the party something like that are messing around yeah messing around has been around so they smell smoke yeah\nHe goes out to savor burned to death and she crashes opened the high rise window and then an explosion pushes or out or when Alan loved to kill women or\nYou go back and look at his movies there are they fell out of glass elevators they fell on a ranch on something or some of these beautiful women will always being killed\nMight've been OJ Simpson for [noise] believe it was a ... throw him in there too and then of course all Newman OJ Simpson Richard Chamberlain\nAs Susan blob or Avon citizens are Jones a stabbing they call them and it goes on and on\nAnd on [noise] we'll be right back six zero to five

Telhami about but I don't know the movie at all about a ballet dancer and an over controlling mother\nIs it's a fine film it's very very dark and it's a few years older years old by bleak ending but very very dark\nWell these are oh this is Natalie Portman yes ha ha ha ha ha ha gotcha okay great uh if you wanted to recommend to our audience good political movies uh that would be a good category for us to talk about as well\nA lot of people will start with um with the candidate Robert Redford with Robert Redford which is I think okay a lot of people don't remember but I think maybe the better movie was the one with Ellen elder what\nWas it the education of do you know this one where he was he was the United states senator a tend to all the education all think of it in a second the ... ... ... I think that is a better movie but I I start people I think I I think it's worth starting\nPeople off with um with the Robert Redford a Robert Redford Dustin Hoffman movie about Watergate I think all the President's Men is a great political but\nIt is to find some I Would go back further I'd go back into the Nineteen fifties and start with it\nWill actually uh I'm Sorry where I'm decade early Nineteen sixties\nThe manager and candidate okay an advise and consent advise and consent is a tremendous number money film or the ... cat was kinda band for a little bit wasn't it wasn't allowed to come out when it was first made right because of this was ... very Frank Sinatra right\nUm and that was just remade recent Janet Leigh and generally and this was this was a remake rights that lousy lousy remake everything was remade as we discuss last week with the exception my opinion of Cape Fear was lousy\nCape Fear was a pretty good ... fear was better than the original as any other remake better than the original other than Cape Fear that's uh that's that's hard because you know what's\nWhat's also a bit of a political movie a bit um everyone will will say well what about Mr Smith goes to Washington okay but uh I I think it's a wonderful life has political under tones that are pretty interesting very much so I think it does I I think it is that still a great movie um\nBut you know the audience my audience is you know conservative as it is a doesn't have a lot of love for um who all the President's Men have become a source but it is a good movie it is and it is instructive\nTo the press today which all of them want to be Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein but none of them are they don't do the work that was depicted in that book or that movie um you know\nIf there was a use of anonymous source it was certainly double and triple quadruple checked and they really did do leg work when you watch what journalists used to do to get a story it's a lot different\nDo you remember there in the stacks and they're in phone books I mean it's just it was real journalism what was the recent film with Meryl Streep and I'm at a loss for words I just thought regarding her relationship with um\nShe plays Katharine Graham oh right this is a I I didn't know that movie came out I heard about it I heard about it was coming out a very good political so it is a good political film okay this is the one about the Pentagon papers interesting one of the things I was I'm told about the film 'cause I haven't seen it was\nThat it ... and if you saw you you would know better that it was an effort at some point to evidently in the film to um make Nixon the villain and you know next and was suing to or his ... his ... his department of justice was suing to stop the Pentagon papers\nA from being published but it was all about stuff that have taken place under the Johnson administration was trying to protect things that took place during the ... his admit he was trying to keep confidential the actions of the Johnson administration to protect the notion of national security and um and and more time national secrets and I don't know if that came\nThrough you saw it I don't think it came through yeah so it was it was certainly an anti Richard Nixon film I got a movie recommendation from a listener of artist named Andrew just came in seven days in may so when you're familiar with seen it I haven't either so let's look it would have to watch yeah we have to watch\nSeven days in may [noise] um no the um that was the funny thing about the Pentagon papers is a is that uh as I was as I was a study in the case in\nLaw school you know we're all thought and taught in law school\nTo think of Nixon is the villain and Nixon is the runaway Justice Department but it was a a an effort by him to protect national security secrets that were committed before he became president and he was really truly trying to\nEffort the protection of classification of classified

I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I Know I was just thinking about that well you ever you know there was an older you'll see them and if people remember Steve Allen did the Tonight Show and he wrote this book call I think it was dumb ass\nAnd he said he pulled up to the post op San Juan heavy box he's having a lot of trouble lifting the box he finally gets to the counter at the post office and the clerk and Steve Allen's the only one there he was before Johnny Carson and the car says where's your number\nAnd Steve Allen says I don't have a number he says well you'll have to go back to not much we can freeze the box always it back plus I Want you know those numbers like you might get it a bakery or at a deli counter something\nGrabs the ticket comes back with a heavy box walked up to the counter he's the only one there and the postal clerk says Thirteen call says number but that's the postal service right that's always been the reputation hey but you've got to give them credit or seems those who investigated these kinds of things that an excellent job [noise]\nUm but seriously it never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are well I don't you know President Trump says we have the best and the ...\nI think in in in this case you notice around the world when there's investigations of plane crashes or any issue like that but you know last plane lost ships whatever it was called the United states we have tremendous law enforcement people\nWhich by the wayside was why are so disappointing to see the upper echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department engage in a soft coup I think a lot of people knowledge that now against the legitimately elected president of United States Donald Trump\nOr unhappiness with these top officials as I said was never meant to reflect on the regular Asians those would be the worst day in and day out in the FBI and other agencies\nWhich as I said that's why so disgraceful to see those in power tarnish the image of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies and then you have the Democrats saying\nAll the Republicans don't support the FBI no we do support the FBI we don't support it becoming you know as soon as you're being so tarnished and so ruined because someone you engaged in an old like a banana republic activities that's why we were unhappy with the top people or the Justice Department people like Clapper Brennan and the rest of them [noise]\nSo what are the suspect winds up being someone with deep mental issues\nOr someone who's just evil\nThe fact remains that in this country you do not get back at your political enemies by threatening them with harm or worse you just don't do that\nNeedless to say these type of acts can do irreparable damage to our political system\nAnd the you know you don't you know on the line I think of what the uh the Hillary Clinton people in the left and those who are out to get the president is what they were doing that's why we're so disasters someone should be pointed that out\nWhen he tried to do the political system is what you guys already with the political system and trying to get legitimately elected as a president or impeached\nNo one can defend this behavior and everyone should condemn it this is pure evil no matter which side of the political spectrum the perpetrator is off and it looks like we do loans sure looks like what did he have a stickers on his van and actually it looks like one of those crazy such and want to be around no matter what side but it's ...\nWe all get deeply frustrated and disappointed when people we disagree with control our destiny\nIt always amazes me that those in the resistance against President Trump have no clue nor do they probably care that we were as unhappy with his election and the ... election of President Obama to the presidency as they were with President Trump's victory\nThat would never dawned on them never never never dawned on them [noise]\nAfter all many of us thought Iraq Obama was the worst president in our lifetime if not in our history so what are the announcer was five days I think it was five days before the election that he wanted to fundamentally change the United states of America\nWe are middle class [noise]\nI'd always gotten it wrong I always thought it was seven days that he really gave us notice you ... for job you do give two weeks let us know ... days before at\nWhat previous presidents I Want to ask you had said anything even close to that and which president went on an apology tour soon after being reelected\nHistory has made one a leader steps up stays true to his values and sharks are fundamentally different course for the country\nThat's 'cause you're not in power when you get a power I Wonder if you agree that we should try a fundamentally different course when we get in power that he was talking about Obama I didn't even know that well he should have was right yeah [noise] and apologize for what you may know my sign up is always\nA pleasure privileged to have like front of the greatest history a country in the history of the world\nBut we're on our side never engaged in a resistance as such we never engaged in a soft coup we never threatened to bomb the White House didn't lows actresses or singers threatened that like that march that day of or the day after whatever it was\nPrinted you see this in the New York times uh about the assassination of the current president I guess it's\nSupposed to be fiction obviously bought a gift you know we don't do that kind of stuff but the left and the Democrats and the press which is really the same thing\nHas never accepted as victory and will do anything to remove him from office that seems clear including blaming his rhetoric for the suspects violence which is where I'm going to go now even before anything they knew you know they didn't know much about the suspect\nSo this will be used and it's being used to hurt President Trump and the Republicans [noise] especially with the November elections just stays away [noise] so this guy did it because of what President Trump says that's what they'll have you believe [noise]\n[noise] so they're almost all on the left and we are fortunate to have someone like President Trump called them out\nWe've had so many we presidents in the past and it's absolutely refreshing to see someone take it back to that even if the media the left the Democrats can't take it President Trump is not responsible for the craziness\nThe country tell me what you think as I said eight eight eight nine seven one ... and let's try to get a caller to in Houston, Texas let's go to Mark Mark you're on with mark Hi Mark\nAnd mark a mark on what you were a bringing up about a media is absolutely true they want to report the fact that this is a cycle and here's a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida light power and I I don't know some other bomb threats to\nSow what Trump responsible for though no he happens to be just you know the ... the ... you know and another distinction is the fact that you know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up or anything or to set a few times during\nHis his uh his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times we said oh yeah go ahead you're on the face or something like that that was but he hasn't said anything like that where the the the law whether it's the the actual political people or the the news\nUh they've all actually says there are going out and confront them and and and and and run them out of the stores all this other stuff so um again that's the part of the contrast and different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know they're in the cabinet ... this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that oh of\nCourse it's the the the ultimate double standard that everyone recognizes that accept them well they'll they recognize it but they're not going to say than even most of the hard core I Would say\nYou know intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something there that way if the Trump arrangements that I'm now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it does you know that's what they would say no question about it\nBreaking ATF news just recently in the U.S department of education announced that\nActing on a

the price of oil over this trying to just attached to President Trump there's nothing they'll stop at to try to defeat him let's go to Pam in Dallas texas Pam you're on with mark\nAnd it just dawned on me I thought was driving and listening to what it's about to unravel and have have actually started\nYes and it would go back to what Dr ... eloquently and sad is that\nEven after chemotherapy you cannot say ensure that every single cancer cell is gone and so oftentimes when we go back and take the lead lumpectomy or mastectomy\nWe still see residual are leftover disease there so when we're assessing respond to treatment sell if somebody comes in and they've had their chemotherapy and they initially started off with a five centimeter math and we examine them and say you know at least we don't feel that math\nWe you can't really reliably say that every cancer cell is gone what you can say is that we don't feel anything and you've had a good response to your therapy but that doesn't equate to all of that being gone\nSo then let's reverse a Becker kind of go if someone has a mastectomy\n\n... y radiation after that great question\nThere are categories of patients who have had most stuck to me that don't need radiation therapy because their risk of a rip currents without radiation is very low single low single digits or we're not going to improve their outcome and we don't use radiation in that setting\nIs that based on a very mentality\nYes it's based on how well they do with surgery and whatever drug therapy Dr Kato chooses to give them some patients received the estrogen blocking drugs only some patients receive chemotherapy only some patients receive both\nAnd many of them do well after most stuck to me and there was no value to radiation but if that number is high enough if the numbers they over ten percent we start to consider using radiation because once the number the recurrence risk is over ten percent we can actually save lives by using radiation to prevent those recurrence\nDid you want to add anything back into\nNo that's exactly a good explanation\nAll right we've discussed locally advanced life stage disease in treatment\nLet's talk about stage for Dr kiddo what what\nIs staged for what are the prognosis what is the prognosis for stage four\nSo staged for is once a cancer has spread outside the breast for breast cancer it tends to go to the bone belong and the liver that is no longer a curable cancer but it's treatable\nAnd we have excellent medications to treat stage for breast cancer\nThe prognosis is different on everybody it really depends on your biology or if you're a tumor and then again the biology weather is a system put just from positive for her to positive because we have targeted therapy now for those type of breast cancer\nPrognosis or\nWith stage four eventually you'll die from your breast cancer and the reason we do radiation surgery and chemotherapy earlier stages is to prevent a patient to develop stage for D.C.'s\nOr that they always give you a number of five year survival rate but to be honest with you they lump all the breast cancer together I don't give a number you make your own journey and and your journey with breast cancer\n\nO M stage for\nDoctor Murthy is there\nAny good cause is there a benefit to doing surgery um someone with stage four so as far as because if it's\n\nOutside of the breast itself and we're doing surgery on the breast\nLike what a veil\nAnd that's a great question um antiseptic to a lot of debate a historically the answer was no unless they cancer was eating to their breast and became a wound problem or was bleeding and\nSo in those cases that was really the only indication or reason to do any type of surgical intervention which was generally a mastectomy however with great advancements better treatments\nAnd with better technology to even detect small amounts of matter of static disease patients are living longer with their disease\nAnd so there are some studies showing that maybe in those patients who have done so well to their therapy there systemic therapy and there does and their systemic disease or their their medicine addict disease has responded to that\nThat is there any value and going back and removing the primary breast cancer and so\nOn until they are I Would say better studies to show that that would be the best way to go it's really an individual um decision and every patient is different and so in general if a patient has made a static disease but they've had such a great response to their\nUm systemic therapy\nAnd they are in good health then we will remain the primary cancer\nAnd then back in time I Do a in states\nFor breast cancer radiation uh what are we trying to accomplish that point\nRadiation therapy for stage for breast cancer is used to\nControl problem areas or cash response in different parts of the body that could become a significant quality of life of fact\nI'm cause pain cause neurologic problems so the radiation is used artfully to try to control those spots before they become a problem occasionally someone will have met authentic disease and that's cancer that spread beyond the breast beyond the armpit on that side and beyond the low neck on that side\nEverything within those areas is still technically not met a static but if it spread beyond that but you're just one or two spots we sometimes treat those one or two spots with surgery and radiation depending on where they are with the hope that we can get that patient a good long interval before the catcher appears\nAgain when it comes to [noise] life stage or let's go beyond ... stage when it comes to stage for breast cancer any of you\nWhat do you want people to know that we haven't covered\nSo what I Want to do that was what I Want to know that uh we have\nNew treatments an excellent treatment for breast cancer\nOr for your PR a positive or we have brand new medications that double the response rate and you can live for years\nUm have you have hurt too we have excellent target therapy a force a triple negative we're doing clinical trials in immunotherapy a which are the newest thing and and and many a treatment of cancer at this time\nAh so ah there's a patients are living longer and longer with stage four breast cancer\n\nRight folks so before we go off the air I wanted to bring up a couple of things and uh one is uh\nRegarding the packages are sent out this past weekend discovered you know when you look at it and I'm not going to go into postage stamps that\nWorse or packages that were sent through the mail\nAnd yet the stamps were never canceled out there is no visual signs of that I'm not going into all the hip comes I just want to look at this\nThat when you look at the people that received packages and bombs isn't it amazing they're the same people that are considered such high profile they are the most visible and attacking our president has cabinet and every move his administration makes I'm also a realist\nAnd reality coupled with a few brain cells brings me to the logical collusion conclusion that this thing smells to I Am and keep in mind these people that have allegedly been targeted are the same people but it looks straightened to the cameras some years back and spoke clearly and microphones\nAbout health care program that would give government ever increasing control over your health they spoke stating that Obamacare would allow you to keep your insurance scarier keep your doctor Andrew ... premiums would definitely be lower\nThese people are the same people that were in government than and are active in that first to eliminate our president his efforts and they are ever obsessed with gaining power again\nThese are the same players that ran guns in fast and furious and then claimed executive privilege these are the same people that wound up being responsible or in a roundabout way for the death of border agent Brian uh\nJerry ... keep in\nMind that these people claimed executive privilege to keep the party from exploding sense of top of the Obama administration where the key players\nThese are the same group of people that bold in an innocent man jail dam and ruined him and his family's life by setting him up as a video producer that was blamed for the blood of four Americans\nNow and you said there was how much vitamin C. and your supersede twenty two four years Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving so by by taking supersede twenty two then what water some of the the things that you'll experience well the first thing you're going experiences\nEnergy vitamin C. produces energy in the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain cardiovascular issues allergies unexplained weight gain diabetics need vitamin C. the list goes on and on I have a number of patients and clients that are using it\nAnd I brought some emails is it okay if I read an email to sure sure um this is one of my clients from Tallahassee his name's Ron okay listen to this after three days of being a super see his blood pressure dropped it he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number drops seven points and that's after three days he\nSaid no another thing that happened is I became more alert and I now have a clear head off and vitamin C. yes one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it the average life expectancy went up six years wow that's really amazing\nI Want to let your listeners know that if you want to get a free book about vitamin C. and try Dr ... says supersede twenty two formula absolutely risk free there's a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred\nTo zero

eight hundred to zero eight one nine six zero\n... just tuned in we have Dr Michael take us back in the studio with us today he's a leading authority on both natural and alternative health we've been talking about how critical vitamin C is in terms of overall health\nNow Dr fingers I got to ask the question I mean you know you you you've kind of talked a little bit about some of the things that we can be experiencing without having enough on them and see but you know the reality is that I'm sure I'm not getting enough item and see based on what you said I I I'm not arguing that point but the reality is that I'm Still standing\nI I still wake up every morning what's the big deal here\nI mean hasn't the government figured out that there is some level of vitamin C. that you need to have in order to be healthy\nWhen you're talking about the government and nutrition and health recommendations\nBoy they get like a dean minus because they're already a for vitamin C. it's sixty milligrams sixty military ... inadequate the RDA for vitamin C. was determined so you don't die from ... but sixty milligrams of vitamin C. is like partially water and your grass and so it's not quite brown\nYou see what I mean and that's the problem with our bodies is that we're not getting the vitamin C. we need and you need vitamin C. the right amounts and the right form in order to get yourself into a high level health or why why is that is so critical do why is getting enough fight 'em and see so critical\nJust to recap number one your body doesn't make it too is that if you're not getting the right amount of it which is at least three thousand four thousand five thousand milligrams per day vitamin C. you're going to be someone who is on multiple mates\nYou run into doctors you're got blood pressure problems you don't make the good cholesterol triglycerides are high you might be diagnosed with diabetes he of pain in your body you're looking at old and you're feeling old before you shouldn't be oh\nAll right well let's let's get into this a little bit then I mean can you talk about what's in your super see twenty two formula\nYeah what I have is first of all it's a powder that you mix into cold water okay and each serving is Fifteen hundred milligrams of vitamin C.\nOkay and it has twenty two different sources of vitamin C. which is very very important for your body what's the benefit of having those twenty two different sources well the benefit is is is that your body recognizes these from nature\nAnd there's there's a number of different sources from nature there's rose hips broccoli\nCertain type of cherry called an asteroid cherry lemons lines grapefruit with the supersede twenty two I've tried to duplicate what's in nature and I put it into one form I see okay well speaking of which can we can we make some yeah I Want to try it right here yeah okay All right now why why a powder instead of let's say a\nA pill or a capsule or something like that ... vitamin C. it's it's necessary to get it in your system not just in your blood but down to the tissues\nSo any more than a powder and you put water in it it activates it absorbs quickly this is the best way to get in your body\nIs ... is this most of his\nYeah the ... is showing that is activated the minerals and all the vitamins they're they're actually mixed in in the water\nOkay just keep makes up for a second All right All right let me let me try this [noise] [noise]\nOh that's really good it is good and then yeah it's like a ... taste as actual extremism fruits that I put in there to flavor really good at a good job Dr ... thank you thank you yeah\nPeople really enjoy the taste of it what I recommend Chris as you can actually mix up a bunch of it put in a service or a pitcher you can keep their fridge right or you can drink it throughout the day now ...\nYou know again I think most people myself included have always thought about vitamin C. um you know with respect to cold and flu and building up your immunity but you know you're talking about things that go way way beyond that so what about cardiovascular how how does vitamin C. help with that\nWell vitamin C is needed to keep the inside of the blood vessels\nStrong when and if you look at it most of the problems people are having collapsed arteries strokes ... in their body yeah vitamin C. makes what's called college in tissue in the body\nWithout it you don't make this repair tissue so you get this deterioration occurring when you don't have enough okay so it's very very important for cardiovascular health\nNow when you take your super see twenty two ... is it something you can feel working I mean what ... what kind of do\nOh yeah you feel a work in the first sign of health is more energy and you start

wow I Would never I when you said that I thought oh man I didn't know that about the program\nAs well pretty much anyone on payroll at a school huh yeah I Am school payroll you gotta love it got all of it we have a great market update today also Josh in the stall has a couple of different topics follow the golden rule\nAlso millennials homeownership versus starting a family are taught that there you go and then of course a real\nGym in the valley here some real estate's come back we're going to talk about so you know it's\nInteresting because we were just talking about mortgage fraud yeah now this is a mortgage fraud but interesting there's an interesting yeah Frenchman story but ... why don't we start going to be safe out there man you know that's you know we don't just talk about you know doing business over ... we're protecting our consumer ...\nIf you are an investor or a first time homebuyer you're not going to want to miss the show we have a coming soon property that's going to hit the market in about a week and a half and it's located over in Chandler at re and McClintock area\nLittle sixteen hundred square feet three bedroom two and a half bath two car garage priced while under three hundred thousand we think about that and that's a ... for the most are eighty five eighty eighty five\nPercent remodeled his well under three hundred thousand did yes her man that got us so the fly\nYeah it's not going to last one I just put the coming soon sign out day before yesterday and yesterday I got a call from a from a guy that lives across the street that's been waiting for something to come available he's from Southern California and moved out here a year and a half ago him and his wife and his daughter so he called on it and I said soon as the tenants out of there which is going to be tomorrow\nAnd said I'll give you that the foot in the door right there take a look at it before it hits the analysts so he wants to buy it sounds like a year but we'll see I mean you know when that coming soon signed goes up and some of these areas that we specialize in people calling them right away so why don't we dive into the show do what do you say they're Josh with American update\nDive in water and water and I [noise] yeah I'm going to go by you liked that one admit it and I don't know oh come on I was hurt [laughter] Jovan opposed to that would hurt it but\nYeah I'll go to the update but I just as I Know I never heard that before the flush said that [laughter] I've never heard of him and sometimes you got to be a pioneer with one liners must be a false of cities they must be officers and I haven't lived there for almost Thirty years my friend [laughter] I'm like I'm going to get to this real quick 'cause we have so much to talk about [noise]\nUm so it's not a secret over the last two weeks mortgage rates have really jumped man\nUm if you're out there you're under contract or thinking about refinancing lock now because it's probably not going to get\nYou know go back down I mean we've seen some pretty dramatic increases you know that being said still you know five percent of that term a tremendous rate you know Thirteen fourteen percent when I started doing this you know five percent still very affordable\nHey Josh real quick back in ... foreign oh five when everyone is coming from around the world to buy homes here ... interest rates are six and a half to seven percent back then that's right so if you remember that yeah\nYou know I Do and I remember you know selling eight nine ten percent um the problem is you know we were really really spoiled for about three years and then I mean you know that's a very unheard of period of time to have a right to that low ... I mean\nYou went to stretch of just you know three three percent ... some people think that's still the norm which just as any more it wasn't even the norm back then you know and like I said last week and you no matter what the rates are people who are you know you start you still have to buy a home ... um some some better news uh\nTo suddenly see a little bit of a reduction necessarily in the high end home pricing um\nYou know those seem to be on the market little bit longer so this is the first time we kind of seen those is starting to peel back as far as um the list price versus soul price um another another good little tidbit\nUm lumber pricing is as dropping so that has a incite a you know made homebuilders want to build more so the builder confidence is increasing so that should\nUm result more new built throughout the valley\n[noise] that's interesting you say that because I just talked to a good friend of mine who's a\nA a big cuts to build her here in the valley do a lot of ah and I'm not going to say they do big subdivisions Michelle who is well it's all it's my cage with rainy homes or go [noise] and a really good guy loving guy totally cool and I was had a conversation with him and he was saying\nThat they are a little bit concerned about the spec homes looked at the ... you know kind of contrary to what you're saying but he's in the business and he's saying that it looks like it's going to slow down a bit because prices of materials are up\nAnd now with interest rates going up and you can kind of speak to this little bit and this was white people need to get off the fence and make a move if they're looking at buying a home because when interest rates to pick up a little bit doesn't that make it to where affordability their their purchase power goes down a bit\nAbsolutely so um let me just read this line so builders are relieved the lumber prices have declined for three straight months\nSo it's been you know your buddy I'm you know the other other things might be a factor in the cost threat but I think it's it's the rates man I mean I'll I'll tell you um I had a client who was out there shopping looking in um ... he had two homes that he was trying to get in under contract\nWhen he started the process he was a four point eight to five ...\nHe finally got into his home and we were ready to ... he's at a five point one to five so it's a big jump interesting it's a big jump and that's only in about a two and a half week period while and now now that's a little on normal that's like like I said earlier the rates have been crazy lately [noise]\nAre are there ways to lock in rates early or does it costs money or their loan programs where you can walk rates in early for free\n[noise] Mm not no I mean you can't uh so all of a lock doesn't cost you nothing someone's charging ... that's a joke okay okay there's no there's no cost a lot of reading but the longer you locker right in the worst rate is ideally I tried to lock my clients and to the ... the shortest period possible which is Fifteen days guy\nYou could do a thirty day which is very common but like I said I Try to and I'm not doing it lately because it's been so volatile sure but I Try to manage it so that it I can get them a little bit lower rate on a Fifteen de la okay so if you do the sixty would be way worse\nNow [noise] it's good to know ask your buddy about the lumber I'm care so that is true maybe that's just nationally 'cause this is a national ... a statistic you\nKnow what the lumber the lumber could very well go down in price but you still have labor costs have gone up absolutely and then just other you know other items that you would put into a custom home I mean there's so many ... you know obviously so many moving parts\nSo many in the mirror up to several quick so you know I hear a lot of customers talk about hey I don't want to buy this recession coming da da da da and just ... twenty ... twenty six percent of the time monetary policy has induced over the recession pretty interesting how it is um then I'll just wrap this up with kind of a a\nOf a um I don't know let's get that\nLet's let's just wrap it up right there [laughter] well I was going to say it's kind of interesting with the holidays ... what do you think the day with the fewest birth is\nAnd it's weird the day with the fewest first verse Christmas ...\nOh thanks for answering it I mean I was just putting some of his audit or about to guess Christmas though I wasn't as rod I guess since she's only female in many ways you know\nThat it's interesting I don't know why is that in there but big birth dates or nine nine is one of the biggest birth dates and really interesting little tidbit there at the end it is I like that or you know like the flesh yeah I'm going to\nCome in all of your guys way Mike and Veronica butler here with results real the buyer and seller specialists extraordinary are you guys get it done by the way congratulations on getting at home on sunset and the pecans for\nNine hundred semi thousand under contract in short order could work job bank you think that is good were fourteen days was that what it

started here but you knew but ah give it up for something else\nThat I play play a little little rougher sport for a while ago [laughter] but hey I'm the millennials homeownership versus so yeah so I'm In the family\nSo we we talk about one of those a lot and you know kind of dragging their feet to to purchase because that that is going to be\nYou know the biggest population of of purchasers going forward and I mean that's good that's a huge group of people that you know for ... need to tap into [noise] so um there was a um I got this from the housing wire dot com bank of America did a survey\nAnd two out of every five\nOr millennials are now putting off starting a family so getting married having kids the whole nine yards to buy a house\nSo you know we we talked about it before on many shows back that you know the most loyal just aren't ready they dig they're living at home they take more time or they want to say but more money um you know things like that\n[noise] what are your thoughts on ah becoming a little more financially you know buying a home getting settled and then having kids what are your what are your thoughts on that and\nI have kids in my age group right now and I ... the first starting a family\nI agree a hundred percent I Would too what about you just\nI Would agree as well not not ... not necessarily may have done it myself that way but [laughter] but I mean it it makes sense um\nBans are speaking from experience right that that's the way you do you do you get a house first and then during\nThe you know the bank of America report says um [noise] you know there there have been letting their priorities fall in place on them or at home ownership first marriage and then children interesting that that seems like the way it should be done but\nThat's the way I did hear sounds that's where I just wanted to be settled first and kind of you know get my get my roots planet if you will and then and then you got married and had kids\nLet's go perfect cool interesting Seventy two\nPercent among the millennials consider homeownership a top priority followed by a eighty percent there's retirement [noise] something I Want to retire\n[laughter] and and I have some some quick starts a free of time on this and so the\nDifference between buying now in waiting a year yes this this kind of goes on to you know why the millennials should should by now and this is a um a study that Fannie Mae did um there are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae\nUm so if you wait now if interest rates continue as they're as they're going up um you know a year from now you're probably looking at five point to this not a little bit higher as far as interest rates\nUm the average home prices now is right around two fifty a year from now it's it's a kind of schedule to be around to sixty two\nUm two sixty three us so that jumps your mortgage payment up from you know the buyer on two fifty as probably about Thirteen hundred dollars roughly 'em to a little over fourteen hundred dollars a month\nOkay that's just what the price increase or the price of an interest rate increase prior agenda price and interest I got you\nOkay so monthly um monthly lots about a hundred and fifty three dollars\nAnnually it's about Eighteen hundred dollars right ... that you're losing and then over Thirty years is up about fifty five thousand dollars over over the thirty years' so waiting is not the best option right now mhm\nHundred and fifty dollars just doesn't seem like a lot but some people are trying to qualify that can make or break your hand\nAnd that that can be you know lunch or dinner I'm you know sometimes it can be a car payment you know oh no doubt I mean no doubt can add up yeah\nAnd you start spreading that out over years a year Thirty years\nHundreds and hundreds up to put it in perspective I knew this was an exact but the rule of thumb hundred and fifty is about thirty thousand\nDollars in purchase price [noise] wow All right okay so you may be were approved it to eighty yeah rates change your payment now the hundred fifty dollars more you're you're down to you know two fifty [noise]\nEight

your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that\nIs completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved but it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people do you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurts more\nPretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I feel for this and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with the picture and it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement their\nHow many ... at issue it\nHas to do with simple absorption calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYeah OK yeah and it does do here but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't a diet you know and to us from the bones and self\n... orbit back from the bones if neither that's right but I say and what\nYou just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen yep okay\nAnd so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nFor sure just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet\nHas been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian irradiated hum the calcium as leach from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug writer great but these things don't absorbing the body that's happening for a couple of reasons\nOne when you take a let's say an aunt that had the ... minute like Tom's first of all calcium absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nBut comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences that\nPowder and what happened to put it in hot water and you mix it up and drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that sounds that problem as well\nYeah because when Cal say many of them are in a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says the symptoms or being calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing them take a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications you need sleeping pills but the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula says absorbed in credit when the body the thing is that when you take my comments formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people right Dr pain 'cause I Can't believe a thirty minute took the ... the pain in my wrist one way or I was able to sleep for the first time an error I mean this is really amazing\nAnd have them do a couple of Dr fire ... around in front of those people [laughter] I'm pretty sure they would stop [laughter]\nYeah I Know I take I take first lifted the first one first and second one second I take the point on the Republican form of government to the republic for which stance of course it's a Republican form of government and not a democracy I think\nI'm are conservative brethren in friends will use the phrase um variants of the phrase democratic small D things like that I think it's I I think it shorthand knowing full well that we are not a democracy when are promoting\nWell I Hope not but I take the point and I will uh I Will be of course more careful on it I Hope not because you're absolutely right now as you All right yeah I Know you can you can't\nBut I don't think it's unfair to talk about democratic norms unless you tell me it is no no no no no and I don't make it fair to talk about democratic symbols symbols item yeah right okay we're on the same\nPaying them and Karadzic yeah no I mean quite a thing or democracy like bad guys I Know I didn't ... know you were ... view yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm a credit card will have a problem okay\nDemocratic Party we have a democratic form of voting yes but it is\nFor the Republican\nServices are public and form of government of course represented\nThe or representative ... you know you can't\nGet people to and that's what it is kinda like their diluting the ... a\nDemocracy down to the same as racism or\nI I think what point did is it is it is well worth making and it's well worth making over and over again because it's well worth reminding people all the time about our history and what constitutional Issam really is here we we have moved so very far from it I take your point on the\nOn the second point and yeah hold me to account watcher [laughter] no do and I will only way if if it's a habit of developed I don't think I have but if it is I'm the only way to stop it is you know if I've ever\nHeard you said it's been very very very rare\nYou will snap my wrist with the rubber band if I Do [laughter] I have given you that assignment but on the second I I Am thinking um [noise] that that it's it's a\n... and you tell me I'm a I was talking about symbols of democracy how 'bout symbols of sovereignty I just don't think the vision of this the optics of this are helpful to the cause for which stance I think it's going to a boomerang I don't think anyone can look at this and say we need less border enforcement\nExcept for one problem with this particular situation which is that it's happened already but it is and it's obviously more visible in the news yeah [noise] uh\nIf the president\nCaves on this and get gospel truth I don't know how he can stop it without using force I don't know how he can stop it because\nThey bashed through Mexico Mexico's police were down there to try to stop now how tough they were being I don't know about how tough what our guys ... you know especially when they put the women and children out front\nSo but the other thing I I thought of today when I was looking on the Internet I saw a couple of those pictures I challenge anyone to find any photograph book that group of people walking nor that\nLooks hungry tire thirsty and showered they're all a nice clothes\nIt doesn't you might not be done to look like a standard asylum seeking movement\nTo say have been walking for a thousand bucks up now no model so\nBut anyway I just this whole thing is being promoted and funded by somebody\nWe ... we probably know who I hate to even mention I Know we do not have not given more press get right into anyway I just\nYou know there's no you got five thousand people that are going to the border of the same time there's not an easy fix for this but you can't go or getting a lot of men to let you see how bad it was a lot of bad you can't do that\nNo no I Know I and I think that that notion that very last one you mentioned the worst the better and that's kind of a ... view of things that I've never accepted I mean you know yeah I just I ever expected you know things go to health so that\nWe like jamming out condoms arise in grade school saying well they're going to have sex anyway we just wanted to get me started on that one [laughter] oh my gosh it's the same cycle [laughter]\nEnds of mine are you trying to push your [laughter] lord [laughter] I'd rather I'd appreciate all thank you sir\nPaul called president so I'm a Gen Xer the answer hey well I think there are already in Tucson we got plenty of 'em no [laughter] do you call me\nYou'll have a likely better likelihood of getting in if I miss step and confused or Republican form of government with something else our goal of course is to preserve it in all its form so I Do appreciate that I'm that important point in\nYour right um they do say that you're right the media and particularly op ed writers\nDo use that phraseology but I I go back to my first question really before I even got to the merits of a lot of what this columnist Charles Blow in the New York times was writing I I don't even know if he believes that I I just I literally cannot tell I literally cannot tell\nIf he's the fool or name I think a fool I think a fool [noise]\nSix zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following and they paid political announcement movie or the ... too many lives and

anybody on a conservative talk radio who might have provided endorsement\nOh OK thanks um um yeah so I'm ... I it's funny this year I'm more than almost any other year I don't know if you've noticed this to Anthony but\nI've been getting questions more questions about help on um selecting judges from the vote from the early ballots that have been mailed out then I can remember in past elections are so I'm not sure if there's more for our\nTeam our side is just waking up to the you know more and more uh you know waking up to the need to ensure that our judiciary has judges that actually understand the constitution from it's a perspective of original intent or not [laughter]\nDum la ... the culture principles to follow us there is a step leaves and show [noise]\nTalk about one day October twenty second two thousand and Eighteen this is the ... leaves the show I Am Seth Leibsohn our phone number is six zero to five zero eight\nZero nine six zero [noise] I um I have a bunch of stories I Want to cover what you hear this hour but I also have two questions that have\nKind of been um [noise] been bothering me or the last few days and I guess there's good a time is ending to get into them a a for a night in a day away from our elections are the first is um and maybe we'll do a poll on this survey through our\nTwitter account or something but I I Am really genuinely interested in you know in in what you're thinking is regardless of who you're voting for\nRegardless totally regardless of who you're voting for who will actually win\nA Senate race between mix Sally and cinema [noise] um I have watched the polling um which seems to slightly right now slightly favors the latest I've seen slightly favors cinema but I don't think with a robot liable enough margin\nFor anyone to rest anywhere near or close to the neighborhood of easy\nBut regardless of whether you're voting for her or not and I'm just going to presume most of your voting from excel who do you think will actually when how does it look to you on the ground or in other words the polls right\nAnd the second question Robert robbing the republic had a piece on this today um and Donald Trump is speaking about it on the on the ... and his rallies a little bit\nUm is he on the ballot\nWhen you vote safer um excel your for your Congress men or congresswoman whether to elect them for the for the first time or whether it's to re election bid\n[noise] are you voting a with particular already a of a favor with particular favorability towards that congressman or congresswoman that candidate or are you voting for Donald Trump's agenda how much does Donald Trump's agenda way on your decision\nTo vote those are the questions I'm interested in in answering I Will tell you I'm On the national front it does look really good\nFor Republicans generally when it comes to some of what earlier on was thought to be some close Senate races article out of the hill\nJust not particularly a partisan\nPaper they write the battle for control of the senators looking worse and worse for Democrats who just a month ago saw paths that the majority but now increasingly looked like they could lose more seats and have a smaller minority next year so the Democrats thought\nThey were going to take the Senate at this point there now just trying to staunch the blood flow of loss of further losses to a bigger Republican majority\nRepublicans have seen a bump in the polls in several Senate key races since Labor Day and they believe momentum has slipped to their parties since the fight\nOver Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nPolarized the electorate a two state for Democrats had hopes of major upsets Texas in Tennessee are now clearly moving in fact I have now clearly moved\nTowards the favor of Republicans what they say about our state I Know you want to know here it is races in Nevada and Arizona to other states where Democrats had hoped to make gains remain tight but\nRepublicans feel more confident\nAbout their candidates I guess that goes to my sense too about the confidence I haven't mix Sally doing a lot better uh on November\nAh well one would wake up November seventh or when we go to bed November six than the polls are right now showing I um I think as you heard me say that\nUm that\nUh the Democrats may have some buyers' remorse\nWith how outrageous some of the recent past statements of cure students cinema were\nI think she's a little surprised frankly herself\nCinema herself as a little surprised that uh they have been I'm making so much hanging over her statements because I don't think she thought they were outrageous if you look at her\nResponses one question about them she seems either dismissive or supportive of them not very convincing in distancing herself from them which she could have done had she wanted to or\nHad she believed it uh I I I don't think she does to believe what she said in the past indeed her most recent interaction last week with Arizona Republic on the Taliban quote\nWas to basically basically doubled down on it she basically defended her comments on it um both in style and in substance and style she said she was trying\nYou have a conversation along and in some said she said she was protesting the war and they were good reasons to do so there weren't to no three there weren't you know three there would have been maybe perhaps good arguments not maybe perhaps there would have definitively been good arguments for waging the war differently\nOr there might have been an argument for um\nA ... certain hearings and reauthorization of it but no I'm the idea that are going after the Taliban was was anywhere near debatable in two thousand three um unless you were Michael Moore the fever swamp left in which he traffics I'm no\nNo and I don't think I really don't think Arizona is going to support that Jim is in Phoenix Hi Jim\nJim is in Scottsdale fell on\nDid you start in Phoenix where are you on hold for so long that when you crossed Seventy fourth street\nSo I went from Scottsdale a cave down through cave creek and I'm back in the scout okay [laughter] so it's just\nSo happy call and the first time caller a very avid listener congratulate really really love the intelligence of your show\n... thank you

person whoever that whatever they'll\nYeah title also known as my producer yeah [laughter] your producers they break [laughter]\nHe uh I was\nOn my cell phone or like I ... I was at a bail often hear the question he was asking me\nWell my guess is Jim is uh the way cell phone technology works is my guess is since it was weak you might have been in Scottsdale and there's a Phoenix tower picking it up and might reduce or was relying on our secondary call sourcing machine which tells him more of the calls cell towers coming far\nA cool yeah that way we can find you if you get lost to him in a city or to\nCrush your ... your your colluding with [laughter]\nOh my gosh okay my answers to questions yeah or yeah or you don't want to know that I'm voting for Martha ... will tell you who I Am voting okay fair enough [laughter] I Am voting for yeah I'm a ... and it has\nEverything to do with the two or three\nReasons you gave for a provider remorse or party you were\nOut some kind of buyer's remorse right yeah I think it exists don't you\nOh please way but I have a question yeah\nI Am of the age where when I was in college I did protest the Vietnam War okay I'm sixty eight years old okay and two days before election day I Will turn sixty nine or ten means my birthday\nWas on November for two thousand eight ... Obama was elected uh-huh uh editor\nHopefully we'll have a better birthday for you this year yes yes\nSo I protest the war like thousands or hundreds of millions of people here I generation sure I Do not know of anyone\nWho said or even thought my way protesting is to encourage friends or to look the other way if for him I said I Am going to go fight there'll be a call\nOh yeah you're right Jim you're right I Know difference there was view and Jane Fonda that was the difference\nYeah well well worse like she doesn't go by what what is the number\nYou weren't encouraging but you weren't encouraging them to fight for the Viet Cong and she was that that that the difference I meant\nWell a a\nPerson who was desirous of elective office treat thought it was like a typical for people yeah\nRight on up and fight\nFor their fine with me on a fair yeah she had it finally\nMind with the yeah which is a [noise] buying less sway protesting the war\nWell you know the other hardly any can show the other part of the other part of it sorry buddy the other part of it was um [noise] she said she was just trying to move the conversation along you know there's another way to have done that which is to say no don't joined the Taliban but let's get back to the main point how about taking the other point of view\nAre you in the district that uh are you in congressional district nine by chance the seat but I said I'm I'm like\nUp by paying Kobe oh okay so you're probably in a you're probably in Schweikert district\nBut but we get the literature we give them Crispin course she thinks it's going to a Democrat because it's not our name yeah yeah [laughter] and my wife and I just we look at the stuff we get and there's never anything in there about working across the aisle [laughter]\nI Know that I Know that when you read their own living [laughter] I Know it's a good thing to have don't ever let them don't ever don't ever change your address for don't ever let them know those people left keep getting that support to its good opposition research\nConsistently she puts in there we will defeat that hey I'm thinking she's got this ... trying to defeat herself\nWell yeah what hate what he does the eight ... throwing all that hate ... I Know what is ... said that's hateful or hatred I just\nSay she is yeah yeah he thinks they're all going to load\nThe word you can throw around like racism these days said you know\nYeah yeah so anyway I thought that was that\nIt is interesting thank you for a gym I appreciate that very much\nAnd we all know that her voting record speaks for itself Schumer below sea shells are okay this is really a non issue you can vote Republican with a few of us this time that's what she'll do to my\nGym I think is worse than that I'll tell ya I think it's worse than that I Know she's nurtured in her congressional district the image of a moderate but when you look at these past statements that she is unwilling to renounce or D now so I'm I think who knew the sentence could be ... I think she might be to the left of polo see\nThat that could well\nBe I Know I I mean these statements definitively are I mean yeah I mean it is below sea isn't a doesn't exactly a speak the language of Einstein but I Will tell you she has never said it would be just fine to join the Taliban she has never I don't think denigrated\nA I'm a stay at home mom so we sit on my house I don't think she has ever denounced her home or any state the way cinema has I I I I think this is this is a different kind of a different kind of left us than we're than even we are used to in polo see\nThat's my world that's my we're\nAlso we were ... I'm not real great drop\nOther that he's dying or as a person but\nHe was by far the best candidate you know and\nI'm very please this is Tom pushing hard he was doing that is a Republican is for everybody it's for the country\nI have long sought gym and I you know maybe we'll get there and maybe we are getting there I have long thought in many respects and when you look at some of the numbers\nAre moving his way in the African American or black communities and the Spanish American community\nI was long thinking this guy could somewhat be a post partisan kind of president I Know people are highlighting how hyper partisan our times are but if you take a fair reading and look at his record and what isn't emphases are I I\nI think there's a possibility he could attract a lot more independents than any other Republican House in a very long time at least since Reagan thank you for the call sir lenders in Glendale Lynn thank you for your patience\nAnd this is a land and Gilbert Gilbert you picked up the Glendale ... cell tower it must have to do with those uh those storms out of ten P.

positions\nFor example people will say things like this Republican today's Republican Party would not be recognized\nBy the likes of Ronald Reagan or is grant words I think stupidly said Barry

moderate or independent or willing to work with everybody you know kind of\nAttitude she's trying to portray to cover up her past mhm uh I look for it I there's one thing that I\nThat I heard her say that is a tale of who she really is and that I I ... I had hoped Martha was going to come right back it was one day were commenting on what ... what percentage of votes or support you gave\nAs the you know when you were on your voting and uh it came up that Martin mix Sally you know supported\nThe president a Ninety eight percent of the time however Christian that I'm a noted it in this manner\nShe said that monitor mix Sally supported her president Ninety eight percent of the\nInteresting construction good notice in huh\nAnd and that was an opportunity for Martha you know to unveil who ... ... ... ah I just you know it just just one of those things that caught\nAt how long the moderators let terrorist in cinema filibuster that question I Do believe it I I I it was an amazing amount of time she took it not answering it\nUh twice and I think by the way that was part of her debate strategy was to run the clock as much as possible so that the tough stuff wouldn't be um\nFor lack of a better a suburb itch gotten too [laughter] so that they wouldn't get the tough stuff I I really think that was part of her strategy which worked well for her I think I think it but I think it did well work well for her but I was shocked how how she filibustered it I was also surprised\nThat um and this is a towel on the moderators that when she said Kavanaugh lied to the Senate that was her reason for why should we voted no what bologna and the moderator should've asked her what the law I was and could she prove it you know I have seen them go after those I've seen that main moderator Ted Simon's go after\nRepublicans who have made claims that needed substantiate and I've seen them drill in very hearts that as the claim without substantiate and that has a claim that has been disproven again and again and again and for her to say that and to use that as the excuse I I thought was just total baloney I'm ashamed\nYeah I got a couple of them but she did that was a big past she got 'em on roe v Wade I thought you know her answer was fairly standard it was the only interesting the only time I saw Mick Sally kind of um\nPut the brakes on herself put the skin chain down her tongue a little bit and she didn't shrink from saying she was pro life to her credit um I I I give her that\nBut you know what I've been advising for years Republicans ... ... what I'd been advising Republicans for years on this question\nIs take it run with it but then talk about the extremism of what the left position is on abortion you know the extremism of at what point\nThey are willing to defend late term or partial birth abortions or even as some federal courts have have have have allowed in the past abortions post birth even affective abortions the right to an effective abortion believe it or not as some federal courts have ruled is justifiable\nOut and vote guy would go to their extremism on this\nBecause I'm you know on an issue that I Know candidates are very ... to divide 'em communities on especially communities that that may not poll directly in one direction on this I Know they're very hesitant but they need not be [laughter]\nUm but credit tour for at least saying you know she was pro life but other than that I was a I was I was interested to see how how how that was the only time she decided not to run the clock a little bit more\nOf a very much so much\nThat no thank you for your is Dave I really appreciate it All right my ... um yeah my cold on your on your on your on um on deck first Mark Mark in Peoria Hi Mark [noise]\nA set up an honor to talk with you oh God I\nAlways enjoy your show and perhaps you talked about this already\nUh the Arizona central peace within the last several months regard it\nTo my attention ... cinemas writing a book in two thousand nine\nAlong the lines of being a community organizer and\nHow you have to be carefully scripted particular in this context about how candid a progressive can be and she gave the advice sharing your wisdom you pick one or two points that perspective or acceptable within your market repeat them over and over again without embellishment\nTo me it is a real side in terms of how she her demeanor and how a limit to it or presentation is weathering the debate or in the campaign\nIt's like a Trojan Horse so to me that uh once she should in two thousand nine that she writes one once you get in the door and you can be yourself and that's what's going on I\nI think it's worked for her don't you mark I mean up to a point it's worked for her I ... I think I think November six maybe a wakeup call frankly but up until now it has worked for her wouldn't you say\nI Would and I can I'm concerned that voters do not dealing with some of these things\nIsolated things that she said years ago is just a novelist youthful indiscretion\nShe said but that's just the thing right march she has not said they were anonymous youthful indiscretion she has not said that and when people do their homework I Hope they notice that she just totally dodges the question and refuses to answer it um that's that's what I Hope yeah yeah yeah\nI appreciate your give me a form to talk about the debate and everything you just said thank you\nWell thank you mark I very much appreciate that Mike is in Mesa thanks for your patience my\nNo problem with that was nice to talk to you again it's been a while since I've all thank you sir\nBut hum I wanted to talk to you about your Barry Goldwater okay\nI actually agree with you very much okay um\nAnd the reason that it you know in my manager we we pride ourselves on being authentic with each other and one of the things we always say nobody lie to ourselves more than we are kind of ran right so my issue and wireless Barry Goldwater which was a great speech in a perfect conservatism um my problem is is that when you actually look\nAt some of the things that the Republican Party they does\nIt's not in line with what Barry Goldwater would agree with you I Can't be Barry Goldwater agreeing with things like\n... buying and civil asset forfeiture and and trillion dollar budget and you know undeclared wars and and all kinds of things that are public a party if they really adamantly support them both or when they get to Washington and I can't see Barry Goldwater as a man and and as I as a true\nTrue conservative really being in line with a lot of\nThings I did a list of ... ... ... run the list again by me run the list again that you said he wouldn't be in line with ... ... that's for me\nSorry I think things like civil asset forfeiture I'm just saying minimum ...\nCivil asset forfeiture domestic buying a trillion dollar budget that okay you know things like that I I I Can't see John McCain and Barry Goldwater having a lot but greed met in\n... I'm Sorry we're going to a break your welcome to hold over to the break if you want to and I'll pick up on it and I also will address it on the other side of the break but yeah okay that's the I I I think we can all take two or three issues that\nHave not been part frankly of any Republican debate in a long long long time I can't tell you the last time I was in a Republican meeting or hurting Republicans speech\nThat addressed um at least two out of three of those issues so let let's come back on that when we do okay Mike and also talk about the big things that the Republican Party in cold

so much happening across the board if you bought any political any news station\nLeft right middle line it is so overwhelming all the different moving parts as to what a lot of us do is we migrate to what we call the most important issues in our lives right maybe it's the economy maybe it's jobs maybe it's oil you heard a lot of stuff in discussions even earlier today\nWe were talking about oil but you see all these different things maybe at school choice who knows all this information is rolling around out there on the Web it's rolling around in our publications we subscribe to and we try to find a way to the best outcome and a lot of us what we'll do is we go to our special interest right\nMaybe you are an avid mountain biker maybe or our gym this maybe you've got kids programs scouting you name it\nPeople find a way to them uh jujitsu guy if I have free moments to watch videos I'm typically going on and looking at big guys\nAnd what they do to be the best if there had their practice or what they're what they're doing in their martial arts nonetheless the idea is to bring information that's real meaningful and legitimize is the process see when we look at this we just had a caller named Jennifer that called in and mentioned that she is filing a lawsuit against\nA now senator Katie Hobbs who is running for secretary of state here in Arizona against our Republican conservative candidates Steve Gainer now that the challenge is is that she went down and they took a picture of the governor somebody had no case time [noise]\nAnd um and as you can imagine there there are a lot of symbols in science that we do with their hands with the left or left rules\nHave found their way to basically calling everybody on this earth that doesn't agree with him of course\nA white supremacist a racist a big it a hater I mean this is just this is their their line I mean even David Garcia mentioned that the debate the other day\nWhen he went through the debate it was like the very end of the debate he finally said oh you keep mentioning people that were superintendent public instructions and you're only mentioned the names of those men that were Hispanic\nOr Latinos and so that is obvious you're going after my race and and I'm thinking to myself I think that Governor was actual revering these other leaders\nTo make a point that they are endorsing him not David Garcia but he spun it right the very end they just can't help themselves we've lost we're getting beat up\nOld might as well call guy racist because that's the way it goes so here Jennifer in friends getting smashed around on social media through the media and I'm kind of kicked the media didn't actually verify this I mean I took two seconds and I get on and I found a whole bunch of articles that talked about this being a hoax and one of them is the Anti Defamation league\nThey know a little bit of something about hatred and stuff and trying to vet things and they come out and says how the this is the name of the article how the okay symbol\nBecame a popular trolling gesture okay and what that means if you've been on line people troll for pictures in people's faces I Do it you know I go on here since into my of little mini arsenal that I've been feeding around to different people so they can come out things that she posted\nThat are in in contradiction to think she said I mean she claims to be the architects of Obamacare then she tells everybody she can't stand the systems too expensive well you claim to be the architecture thanks for given us this piece of junk you know and so you kind of work yourself through these and look for it and one of the pictures that these people are fooling four\nIs when people hold up to okay side\nNow the case I was always the case that I have kids in sports I use it to kind of say have done well okay or somebody's been up there somebody asked me a question I say oh can I make the gesture to them what happened is there's this group called for change and it's like a weird little a website That's out there and people post pictures means if you don't know what that is it's like a\nA picture that you might end up in the first time there was some joke across the picture or some wording that catches your attention it may be funny and maybe derogatory it could be inappropriate can be a lot of things right so they find their way there wasn't this case so they went through this and did a bunch of research on this was way before uh Jennifer here this is um [noise]\nI bet they did post is in September fifth\nBut it comes on and says I'm well\nThe OK sign and what they're saying is that three fingers that are up are W and the the old for the okay is actually the top part of a peace so there's your white power right that's what they're saying now they go into this deep and they get deep into it to really find out here that came up with so they um [noise]\nOkay hand gesture originated as one of these hoaxes in February of two thousand Seventeen when a non amiss\nFor chatter that's what they call people that post on for Chan announced operation oh K. K. K.\nThis individual had posted\nThings out there but here's what he said he was telling other members on Twitter and other social media pages we must flood Twitter and other social media websites claiming that okay hand sign as a symbol of white supremacy\nThey use or even provided helpful graphic showing how the letter W. P. for the white power like I mentioned can be traced within a okay gesture the originator and others also suggest to use for ... to help spread the hoax\nSuch as hatched take power and privilege and hash tag not okay and they quote it says you're left is have dug so deep down into their lunacy you wrote that poster\nWe must force them to dig more into the rest of society ain't going anywhere near that blank so this whole stir was actually kind of a right leaning individual\nPuts this up there so that these left these will grab it and go crazy with it which they did\nAnd then to the point where this poor dinner for the call does get smashed show hard even lost her job over this\nAnd you know what I think she has some kind of um I don't know I'm not worried obviously but you think you should have some kind of retribution or come back to her employer because there's no verification that this is real and that as legitimate but nonetheless this person did this in February ... doesn't Seventeen and got the left to go nuts\nAnd now they made a big stink out of it and now we're finding out this is a hoax and you go back and you can find this anonymous poster but he did on Twitter and other places in a time frames all match the picture that I even mentioned I saw here it is an believable but that just goes to show you\nWhat it's all about the other day my daughter was in class and one of her teachers made mentioned um about global warming and said that she had read something I think I've got the story correct and that it was absolute oh actually it was in discussion with our family member she had mentioned she read something about Donald Trump\nAnd I said and that that's why she felt that way she didn't say what site what source what it was in place that she read\nSo my daughter just said OK and tried to figure it out but it couldn't get there I said to my daughter you know next time somebody says something like that you need to say hey\nYou know that Abraham Lincoln invented the Internet and the person I mean what are you talking about and then finish it by saying why read it somewhere once\nAnd it just shows you that you know you have to get to the point where you verify legitimate information to go here this poor lady Jennifer and I'm sure her friends that were in that photograph as well have felt some really negative impact points as a result of center Hobbs being absolutely careless\nAnd you know what center Hobbs I'd if your listeners some of your trolls are listening is the reality is you can't pick on our private citizens and inappropriate way she's trained her governor do she well she her we the people who she says she wants to represent I Hope Steve Gainer is picking up steam\nGaining momentum and we'll just really take it to Katie Hobbs envy or next secretary of state because I don't want somebody like Katie Hobbs who's willing to be so file and not really understand the information that's in front of her before she make public decorations and shame on the media and my gosh\nIt is sad that we keep hearing this over and over and over again and find a way they're well speaking of media\nAnother story kind of wrap up this segment you've got a person named Mike a present Brzezinski and you know you've heard coffee ... joined the morning and uh she's a ... now really crazy I mean she comes out and she says I'm\nTrump is not fit for office okay now have you heard anybody say that before I think I've heard that for a few times by the left right\nThen he comes out and surprise them they watch all these declaration they see the private or public negotiations that he does with different people\nAnd they go oh he might we might not like what he says but at the same time we think he's fit you know as far as metric passed and such and then I Want to talk a little bit about it when we come back and it may not be the most exciting thing in the world for to listen to what do you know about the twenty Fifth Amendment\nHow do you replace a dove or president right how do you what happens if they do start to lose their faculty is what is the process so she suggests\nIn her comments that people in quotes should take a look at the twenty Fifth Amendment or something else so there's two things that are happening was present ski one side\nAre saying you know hey whatever give it up here like the the millions that person that has said this and you haven't made any progress year\nTo twenty Fifth Amendment is a little bit legitimate\nWay of taking the proper steps to somebody's not fit for office no question about but then she said\nThe the story Daniel's comments this week about horse face I mean look he is definitely somebody that dance is on the grade when he when he is he likes to when he likes to be successful he spikes the ball on a routine basis but that comment some of the you may say well\nThat right on President and somebody may say why do you have to say that you know so maybe you don't like that doesn't make him incompetent doesn't mean that you his policies are helping to facilitate good trade reduction or national debt or the unemployment rate than the lowest\nFor and especially for African American Hispanics and you start going straight down his L'Engle my gosh look what's happening and then you see policies in process that are put in place that are going to be for a very very long time how about this one Supreme Court you may not like him\nAnd you may not think he's a conservative president but I got to tell you Donald J Trump\nWith his appointments on the Supreme Court has changed this country for at least forty to sixty years\nSweet and he may have a shot at one more or two more points that would be saying so what do you like him or not if you ... what would you consider real conservative values you have to be through that point alone he's made a mark on history for ever OK forever\nBecause of the Supreme Court justice takes as well so again you get moving around this whole thing and you like it was yeah but the twenty fifth to mimic come on [noise]\nI don't know if she goes by me I think it is make or Mica\nBut I got to tell me ... you know I talk about something else why don't you go somewhere productive like wow the jobs quote sheesh look at people's lifestyles are improving\nTheir more jobs than there are people to fill the jobs we're having this problem in Arizona look at the end migration of foreign direct investments coming to the United states of America because now we've got the open sign on our borders again not open to illegal immigration which Obama the left ... Nancy Pelosi want to see\nBut it's an open science and here we are here to do business with the world\nSome people don't like the terrorists but look at the leverage the terrorists are creating to get good trade deals\nGuess what happened to those tariffs with those nations we now have a good good trade deals with they don't exist\nBig surprise right who negotiated with language or people that know how to negotiate Donald J drop but then a fantastic job and doing that as you know he'll be here this Friday he's got a couple of events one finishing off as a great big rally on friday\nAnd they will shake it up and make things happen and he's gonna keep outlining his agenda and the successes they've had in this nation not just by himself\nBut with the other people that have been with him since the beginning and one of those people are going to be joining us next hour and that's Corey Lewandowski I mean he wouldn't ... won the primary Korea and the president man masterful\nCampaign I got very involved in the campaign later by knew Corey from the beginning from the very first time they came in the campaign all business very focused want to have a great outcome and you need to know who this guy is when you tune in and stay with us next hour\nYou'll be pretty entertaining Korea's remarkable the number of different ways you may have seen them on TV as of late [noise] he's been a talk you hit a number of different shows any any showing up and he's doing it again you listen to nine sixty the Patriot what is Nancy Pelosi talking about Donald Trump's manhood\nWhy in the war which she even bring that up well\nStay tuned this next hour to talk about what she believes is an extension of his manhood and I just can't believe I just said that on there but I can do it when you come back and I'll show you the inside scoop on Nancy Pelosi right after ...

once you're wanting for [noise]\n\nA while back everybody this Robert Graham and you are listening to Seth Leibsohn show on nine sixty the hatred and filling in and it is a good day and hopefully a fantastic day all these things we were going into the break and I was talking about Nancy Pelosi who my gosh this is one person\nWhere I feel like I've encountered multiple times in my life because I met a lot of crazy people and I just kind of reference back to Nancy Pelosi and think oh my gosh I don't know if you've heard her speak some times or watched her on video where she is very uncomfortable for content\nShe literally have these nervous too which is like you see people that do public speaking even President Obama when President Obama spoke off teleprompter he had a rough time\nGetting through things he was the master and he quite headed\nThat difficult to string together more than just one thought and I don't think it's because he was dumb necessary it's just hard to be a public speaker and the talk all the time but all the issues Nancy goes there well here's one if I was a democratic candidate I Would ask Nancy Pelosi the shot her mouth\nBecause she is making all these public declaration that issue if they win back the house and of course she believes that she'll be elected speaker of the house again which would be terrifying but that she will take up more legislation for gun control\nAnd laws that would support and help illegal aliens illegal aliens it just makes me wanna fall over in my chair but to stay on this topic\nHere's the headline on roll call polls seem not willing to trade over border or trade over border wall calls it Trump manhood issues [noise] okay\nSo what Nancy Pelosi is suggesting that um [noise] maybe our president doesn't feel adequate and\nNancy Pelosi when she was talking about Trump's manhood she wouldn't go as far as talk about the wall really she just said it was not going to be a ... it wasn't going to be as effective as he thinks it will be\nAnd it won't work well let me tell you something okay we know that walls don't work their ladders their tunnels and such as it relates to the masses it does work okay so for a small select groups like the drug cartels and such\nBut then when it does it slows down the volume of slows down but the one thing I like about it more than anything it's disillusion right\nSo of course Nancy says it won't work but then there is no solutions on the heels of what would work so we know the human sector they have some very creative\nTechnology and things that they've used ended up it's like almost zero porous I mean it's like if somebody makes or wherever that border than human sector chances are they're going to go find their way into a missile proving ground\nAnd to me eat something that they don't want to eat like a bomb falling on top of their head and so the military is very very particular how they do that but they've got a little bit of a buff\nSo they've got these great cameras at the end of the Mexican or over the ... over our border into Mexico it goes like a mile either way they have infrared that motion detection they've got walls they've got everything right\nThis all the above strategy which presidents did outline a napkin made its way around this all above strategy is something that is smart and it's efficient and effective and it's cost effective\nBut Nancy wants to just say hey doesn't work it's it's easy to be critical\nBut here's the deal so when I was interviewed on Jay show he asked me what is your solution I said the first thing we have to do\nIs build a wall and he was like well come on that just to have how I Am too easy and I said well\nI said why is it so easy this is my strategy and he said why why is it so easy and I said well here's the deal\nHow do you deal with any of the interior enforcement right so we have drug cartels human trafficking that drug distribution we've got a lot of other illegal behavior that happens crimes and such are prisons are schools or hospitals or infrastructure is getting hammered by people that are coming\nIn and not participating are contributing to the system so it's hard to repair\nWhen we're breaking things down faster than we repair them right\nSo how do we deal with it is interior enforcement if we don't secure the border\nI mean because look if you've heard it once you've already twice you've heard it three times where people get deported they come back they get deported they come back to get deported they come back\nWhen you have a porous border they're still going to have the same impact points on our economy our crime our education system our health system not to mention all the other illegal behavior that's happening around those illegals that are crossing\nIn a way that's not consistent with the law so be as nice as I can\nI don't want anybody in this country they shouldn't be here is a contributor I don't want anybody in this country that doesn't have the value or can't express the value of being a U.S citizen\nLook I Love it yes we are a nation of immigrants but do you know that even an Ellis Island if people had like a store\nThey were turned away I mean come on I mean they were there was a process before that was easy and clear then it just as time has gone on it's become more complicated because that richness of Being American the belief in the American dream continues to entice the masses right\nLet's just say that that's it so we want to do with the right way or the other thing that's really critically important here\nIs that there's people in this nation\nThat do it the right way who am I ... one person I Love\nAbout doing the right was Bram resident of channel twelve\nThat guy is liberal that guy will put out the the tears and um the handkerchief for all these undocumented people that are being arrested and deported but if you ask him he did it the right way he's from Canada he became a U.S citizen did the right way why in the world\nThan they do it the right way why because you know just the right way he want to have conflict disruption as life or anything on the back and\nHe's a contributor as much as I don't like him contributing to our news cycles he's a computer right one way or the other in my mind he's got a right to everything that I Do\nFirst Amendment his political views even though I Do not like them he spends a lot of the information I think in the wrong way and quite honestly I've never really develop relation with the guy but I don't need to because he took the right steps

outcome here for our country to get out and vote for him mistakes I mean right here at home you when politics in your backyard that tell you when you win by one vote at a time one sign in your front yard you'd be amazed at the impact points that you can have\nIf you're not afraid to open your mouth but it's much easier to open your mouth and you know the candidates we actually have some basis of understanding and so on shows like this\nWe tried to bring it can it can hear what's going on from their perspective and really what they're now they're trying to accomplish but but how does a fight going today in Studio with me I've got the candidate for secretary of state\nThe Republican conservative candidate for secretary of state Steve Gainer and as you know he's fighting against are well known Democrat progressive Katie Hi Steve thanks for joining me\nOh thanks for having me Robert you gotta hey this is really crazy I mean we talked a little bit earlier in the break we were talking about the donations that are coming from out of state and then this whole concept of I vote voter registration can you can add to this all up on how that works\nYeah one of the major contributors to the Arizona Democrat Party which is running ads for Katie Hobbs is a an organization called I vote you go to their website I vote for America and what they say right there is there objective is to eliminate voter registration\nWhat they say is voter registration is the tool of voter suppression\nThey want to eliminate the whole process of voter registration so that I guess they want everybody to vote\nYou know it's pretty it's pretty pathetic in a sense I mean we talk a lot about how and we've and this is it pretty clear strategy by the left is where we get a lot of undocumented people that are moving into this country through the especially through our our southern border but a lot of people don't even talk about our northern border but they come here\nAnd one of the suppose it or documented strategies\nIs that the more people they can bring it whether it's through amnesty or some other means they can find a way to registration and vote now you're saying\nThat groups I vote are saying forget this whole registration thing what is going to get as many people to vote for us as we possibly can and if we're the ones that drive this likely they'll vote with us\nRight voters targeting secretary of state races in seven states around the country Arizona is right at the top of their list\nYou know it's interesting ... or or the Democrats in two thousand twelve had like this five state strategy and they believe that in Arizona was the last the fifth state and the strategy\nThat if they and they said hey if we win the state to state these four states then we're going to have the president's which they ended up with her I didn't have to go to Arizona the way they want to do and then if we can't when they said that we need ... you can't win the state we need Arizona anyway they had the strategy they took it down I was online as public for a little while\nAnd um it was it was pretty mind blowing but if you lose\nArizona you really pierce the red veil and our voter registrations in our favor we've got turned out in our favor we got a number of things but for whatever reason Republicans sometimes you know the red wave broken the beach\nAnd now people are standing around on the beach watching the blue waves kinda mountain grow and so it's terrifying to think that they could have control and there's no question in my mind I Know you you can't say it's all said\nGeorge Soros is behind this kind of movement because it's it's a it's almost a way to form anarchy and are bringing his progressive a mode of operation and and really the chaos that that follows this kind of nonsense\nWell look [noise] ... and in an open meeting that she wants to have the secretary of state's office to hold onto the Democrat wins and how quote unquote we're going to continue to make gains in the legislature this is what she says she wants to do a secretary of state\nSo she said she wants to be the secretary a straight to hold to help Democrats win elections\nThat's what she said yeah it's actually running on our commercials that we started yesterday on TV\nOkay good because I mean listen if you if you guys are are tuned in here and you're listening is this is the type of stuff that they called a slip up because I don't think anybody the right mind would say something like that especially when they're running for office that represents everybody this is this isn't integrity office this is the opposite you would hope\nPeople would actually quit messing around with the politics and just kind of focus and write down the fair way and make sure it's balance for everybody\nAnd she declares this and that should be terrifying to you I can understand the comments about the pick ups on the Senate and house you in the state which they haven't had any pickups and hopefully they won't right now going into this election but it should be terrifying to you if if that's the case now have you\nHow many how many interactions if you had when she's in a room with you and you've seen a lot of voters do you see your work in the room does she ever go around and talk to people or she can stay in her corner\nNo we we haven't really had many interactions I've been with or just twice on uh on TV or taping a TV segment and that's it so I don't have a good son so I just know from her voting record she's very far left\nAnd when you see organizations like our our vote come in behind her you you can see why if she's broadcasting that she wants to use the office to elect Democrats that's like a cat and it\nHas catnip and actually it's a great um metaphor because when you start thinking about catnip and when it does the cats and energize and right right makes him go wild and crazy and and that's the thing that I worry about is that the left has kind of lost their waste so much\nAnd many of them would say they appreciate the integrity of the system in our country and I mean you talk to your friends that are Democrats have they'll say that\nBut then when they hear something like this or who and then you get that small one percent ten percent whatever it is that starts to really turn the crank and that's where the problems come because they they mislead the public and what the real intention of the person running for them to get her office\nFor fortunately in our case we know and like right now so\nTalk talk a little about your vision and I mean that's one of the things that I I feel is absolutely boy the Democrats who want to call everybody raises biggest massaging as whatever their new label is for the day but what is your vision for the office going forward\nYeah the office needs to be turned around to me it looks like a classic corporate turned around the kind of done about ten times in my career\nUh it it's lost its way a little bit you need to redefine the mission and the goals that the right people in the right jobs and start serving the people and ... and in a nonpartisan way because the secretary of state's office needs to be run that way\nI'm ... and ... on my campaign staff I actually have Democrats than a Democrat and an independent\nUh I Would run the office the same way you can't have only Republicans in an office that's designed to serve all the people it's not a policy office it's\n... it's there to oversee elections of course there are other functions like the museum and they are cars but the key is making sure elections are run properly for everyone yeah\nWe've seen this I mean we see in the last couple of cycles are always seen some incredible disruption right to election process and some people felt like they couldn't but that they didn't have an opportunity to get out there and to express their\n... their once and who they wanted to vote for it because they lay the winds were too long they couldn't get to it or what have you or systems were broken like even his Maricopa County this last election cycle on how many hours or systems were now but they were down\nIn itself is pretty frustrating and I know that the state doesn't necessarily control the counties but you work as a smart partner how would you work with the county recorders 'cause I Know that that job at every level those are\nThat's a tough job for them and that is tough to interface with them\nAs well I've already started building relationships with the county folks are not well with every county but I Know quite a number of the counter recorders now\nI Would want to work with them in a partnership a especially in the smaller counties where they lack resources lack technology offer assistance that's what they need and and and the case of the larger counties or bring them some approaches to management that maybe they haven't thought about\nBecause the folks there are trying to do the best job they can but it's like about elections happened very infrequently so you want people with management experience and especially where we've had problems in Maricopa County work with them\nYeah it's it's interesting because you talk about the corporate I'm a corporate guy first you know not and I applied a lot of corporate principles when I was the chairman of the party and they said you can't do this\nYou can't not typical nontraditional thinking my gosh it's an operations for heaven's sakes and if you apply smart processes where you actually save some money creates an efficiency is and you actually hold people accountable you can have great outcomes when I hear you talk about that with the state I mean obviously there's laws that can govern your behavior is different than if you're just trying to corporation\nBut at the same time and it's it's interesting to hear you talk with a partnership with the kind of records 'cause that was one of the things I heard is a complaint with Ken Bennett Ken Bennett actually went out and visited\nConstantly with a kind of a course and they appreciate even though they didn't line up politically they knew what their jobs and they and they aligned and then I heard you know I don't know but this last cycle because I wasn't involved last two years is the chairman but even leading up to it I didn't hear that with Michele Reagan is that kind of what you've heard\nThat yeah there's been a lack of communication are kind of uh the county people feel that the the there was just a lack of a good relationship with the secretary of state it shouldn't be that way or it's not one so I Try to dominate the other that's working together to get the job done for the people\nWe're going everywhere we can talk to folks and um I've been getting a great reception I have to say so if\nYou're just joining us and we've got Steve gain or who's running for secretary of state here in Arizona and the events that he's talking about legislative district meetings in such that are around the state\nIf you have never been to one of those look it up look up if you know what legislative district you live and I live in L. D. Fifteen so if you look up legislative district Fifteen it'll show you where they meet and you can find your way to just make sure you don't pick the Democrat allegedly district Fifteen\nBecause you may be a little uncomfortable during their meeting but um and and this was finding your way so in some hills this Saturday that washes October twenty if\n... Republican club is a Senator Jon Kyl is going to be out there speaking Carson Dave Schweikert Steve Gainer and then you've got others that are running for various office but ... this is a good way where you get to look at Steve eyeball the eyeballs\nAnd that I that I appreciate the same with the with these legislative district meetings and that's one of the most powerful components of campaigning and it's funny 'cause he says I think we've got these three things when you're running at this point especially within the last couple of weeks here\nYou're on with your head cut off people just say go here do this in a lot of times you don't even know what your schedule looks like\nDr I generally am doing three today right mail sometimes for\nThat's impressive I mean it's there's a special titled endurance and I got to tell you also listening\nIf you if you've never run for office it's manic right the days that are way up days that are really not to feel terrible you ask yourself why am I doing this you've been a big investor in your own campaign so if you spend a heck of a lot of money to get beat up you know you're spending a lot of money to have a good outcome and it's it is painful to see this but\nWhen we show up at meetings that we should support and we when we re posting on Facebook and we moved things along with Twitter whatever other social media platforms it shows the candidates and they're not working for nothing it takes a special kind of courage to do it and your family yeah\nYeah it really does help when you get people supporting you does give you energy when I go home with my I've seen my kids are about those two\nYeah it's good well you know we're we're praying for I mean the the the mission is they have the best outcome for the state right now it's clear to me well you're not one ... anywhere near the capital anymore who she's gone you know let's let her daughter term she does she resigned run [noise]\nOr as you wait until after the death or rather I don't know\nSo it probably would rather than mine that's kind of what they do but it's like um nonetheless let's make sure she doesn't get elected so again if you're listening in your vote matters if you're registered to vote\nWhich I Hope everybody is if you're not registered to vote my uncle would have a field day with you either Vietnam her skin is World War two veteran I think you would flip over in his grave and find his way to you because you think that's the least patriotic thing and that uh that any human could ever doing this great country we have that privilege to vote but Steve hey again what is your website\nIt's gainer for SOS Ga why and or if or SOS dot com\nOkay so go there find your way to Steve learn more about um they're all the issues are very clear and your event schedule I Believe there's probably up there as well and I'm so\nThanks a lot for joining us to suck you very much a writer you guys have this Robert grams to them or stolen percent believes in Nineteen sixty the patriots ... elections the equations are simple if you want to win and you have to vote you have to get the most votes there's nothing more scientific\nThan that and the only way that we can actually win as we get our friends or family and those people that think like we do want to preserve these great governing principles as conservatives to get on both [noise]\nSo do you have a responsibility yes you do if you're listening today you've already engaged in the process so now what do you do to broadcast what do you do to encourage what are you doing to inspire people is yours usually as them taking people to the polls if so good job if not step it up\nTo get a drink of ... make it happen via the little spinach Popeye forms on but we got to make sure that we win this Robert Graham who you're back after the break today for ...

little boost of energy but hey you know to keep the energy going if you stay tuned here at about quarter to we've got Korea learned to ask you this joining us\nAnd if you don't know the name you should because he was leading the Trump campaign and the primary and and one just smashed right I mean that was a wild and crazy primary election was Seventeen get it to the polls it off\nAnd make that happen and that that's what it comes down to right now is that Steve gain or in the office he's\nRunning for secretary of state on the Republican side\nAnd bottom line is you want to win going into this last couple of weeks he was up like fourteen to sixteen points I gave her exact numbers actually a pretty darn healthy lead and it looked like things are great and then stiers and I vote other groups came in with over a million dollars in one hand it was one point eight million\nAnd I believe that total got pushed up to about two point four million that they're spending to take him down\nAnd then you hear things that kitty Hobbs says like she wants to get elected to be the secretary of state\nBecause why she wants to help other Democrats get elected or I got to tell you that job whether you're a Republican or a Democrat\nIs so important as it relates to the integrity of the voting process it's critical right you don't want anybody playing politics even if that person playing politics ways in a little bit more to your side\nYou don't want them paying politics with integrity vote we talk a lot about civil liberties in this country and you don't want anybody messing with another person's civil liberties\nDiscourage them down scare where Trump we're going to be in your state and like any like four days you know and I'm I'm going to be there when you do rally see what you do to help us out and get the word out I had my grandmother's a hundred and second birthday I think was then and so\nWe got a whole bunch of stuff working at our good friend Jeff too wet Jeff I tried to get Jeff on with us by the way today and uh you know because it's got this really important job you can't do it because uh the legal\nHe has he has clear through legal but I told her that we would just make fun of them now\nWithout him being on the phone with us but a Jeff sense as best but that was that was when everybody kind of started hitch wagons together and what a great outcome I tell you that was where people don't realize I think it was your first big public rally wasn't it\nIt really was and and the thing is uh you know I think you know what your health if you remember what we found a venue and then I called back and said I don't think there's been there's going to be big enough and then we ... we went to the next thing you really think there's\nGoing to be big enough right there was like that's from jobs I think we need a bigger boat and every time we thought we'd have the right place for people of Arizona\nTurning out and bigger and bigger numbers and\nAnd uh you know it was it it was such a great place for us the airport hangar is that we've used ... down there to come in and people always turn out they've always supported this president\nAnd what they've done is uh they gave a loud and clear message to your US Senator Jeff Flake is safe you know the Trump team and you can't be arguing ... before they retired um and now the president's coming down there and just a couple of days\nTo once again asked the people for Arizona just support his agenda\nSending our next Republican congresswoman give her the privilege of having an opportunity to be a next US Senator from Arizona and she will be more complex jelly will be on the Trump agenda I promise you that\nYeah for sure I mean that in in court you mentioned that em friday\nKnow drums going to be here and he had to President Trump is going to shake it up and he's going to be here and a mother make Sally is\nI just talked about she's up even the last poll that we've seen public pool she's up six points but it's one of fourteen point swing in her favor since the primary so the momentum is right but again it's back to the turnout I mean you've been traveling with the president what is kind of feel around the country right now I mean do you think they're going to have this big\nTakeover in the house and and I don't think the Senate's in jeopardy but what about the rest of the country\nBullet descendants definitely not in jeopardy as a matter of fact we're on the offensive so many great places from Indiana\nTo a Montana to North Dakota to Missouri icy pickups in all of those places I see is holding this done it in Arizona and Nevada I see a very competitive and West Virginia\nVery competitive at Michigan all of a sudden get a great candidate there so on election night twenty days from now we could pick up for five\nAnd six US Senate seat as it relates to the house and I do a lot of traveling around the country and I see the enthusiasm the crowds are for Trump are bigger than ever the crowds with the vice president like travel with on a regular basis are bigger than ever and there's this notion that there has been\nYou know just as this idea of hey everything is so great so we have a little apathy here and we don't have to be involved\nPeople have to remember this election in twenty days is not about Donald Trump but it is about his policy it's about the direction of the country it's about making sure that the men and women who serve an ice continue to protect us from the gangs of MS Thirteen and the people coming across the border because of the Democrats take control of the house\nThey want to dismantle ice that's their platform they wanna reached in people's tax cuts they want to cut military spending they want to do everything opposite of what this team has done for the first Twenty one months of his administration and I just don't think the people there is on offer them around the country want to take our country backwards\nNo it's crazy we just had a a ... for secretary of state here which is like our lieutenant governor and in the Democratic effort that are happening here they talk about this movement around the country club I vote they're turning seven states and what they are trying to do is they were when that office and then do away with voter registration as well\nI mean when I hear things like this it just like my head just wants to spin off my shoulders because I Can't even find my way to white American would think this way let alone whatever party but Americans think this way to the bus up the integrity of the vote\nIt's insane so not just the agenda items that are working so well for all Americans would then start to really throw our whole system in the draft you\nWell look I've got a ... a sad statement to make the Democrats hate this president more than they love their country and that's a sad thing to say because I've said it many times I didn't support Barack Obama when he ran for office like campaigned against him 'cause I thought we would have had a better chance was somebody else but when he became the president\nThe country's supported him because we want our country to be successful in by every measure whether it's economic security whether it's homeland security whether it's national security we're better off today than we were two years ago our economy is growing at over four percent something that nobody could be done the Democrats have no agenda\nThere running on you know in I items that\nFailed for the last ten years and they have nothing to talk about and so\nWhen I hear stories like what you just told me\nIt's so troubling to me that as the greatest country in the world I don't ever want to go and be apologetic about that I don't ever want to\nGo and have to say I'm not proud to be an American I don't ever want to take for granted the right to go and vote for the people that I think\nRepresent me the best 'cause that's what this\nCountry has been built on our opportunity to have our records at the ballot box but the people of Arizona and the people across the country are smart and they see the lives that the mainstream media puts out they see how biased they are against the president and the success that he had and let me just give one statistic\nOne sixty minutes interview Brock Obama when he was the president they interrupted him four times in one hour interview when they interview Donald Trump on Sunday they interrupted him sixty five times\n[laughter] if that doesn't tell you the difference in the way that the media trees this president from others then nothing does but the best part was even though they interrupt I'm sixty five times he came out on top because he's fighting for what he believes it and he doesn't take their false narratives as as factual\nWhere I Love them too he puts them in a box I mean I'll tell you like some of those trade a press conferences when they kept trying to go to a cabin on and just shut them down you're not talking about trade then you're not talking to me and then he just kept moving\nAlong and I think you know he did a lot of people in this country we really appreciate what he's doing he Corey I really appreciate on short notice or your good friend you've done some dynamic things you've got a book coming out called Trump's enemies corrects\nTrump's enemies with young right

if they're all like they all lie over there\n\nThat's why we have spies we've and spy on our allies\nBecause everybody has an incentive to distort troops over there\nNow here's what I find fascinating on the part of the left this was a party the cold George W. Bush warmonger\nRushed into the war in Iraq never mind Fifteen months run up never mind he goes to Congress and get a resolution from the house religion from the Senate goes to the United nations resolution to link Saddam Hussein to declare what he has\nOn his face consequences so Bush was a war monger Bush lied people died\nNever mind Robert de Woodward who's now Johnny on the spot because he's written a book critical about Trump's wrote a book about George W Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq War and said that when George Tenet the CIA director present at the ...\nThe president's first reaction was very it bet your case and required to go back and get a lot more information to convince George W.

years changes the story in the veracity with what she catches\nTornado ... claims ... broader because one of the people Donald Trump brought out you may recall to his debate\nI think it was in Nevada uh when um the NBC selectively released I tried to do their October surprise by releasing his tapes with uh what was it wasn't a Billy Bush\nSome so were some very much looking forward to having

coming up next our yes um I wanted to make a point probably remember this too but if I recall it was Juanita ... testimony written testimony about what happened to her\nAnd what Bill Clinton did your data on reading that all the members of the house and it was that testimony that made the decision they made it than the motivation or work with impeachment against a bill\nThat's my memory too I hadn't thought about that until you brought it up in a long time Steve that is my memory to that a lot of jobs were on the floor when they looked at the way to the evidence of Juanita Broderick claims\nThat was a straw that broke camel\nEighteen two thousand and these teen whenever Hillary Clinton appears\nOn television to talk about women's rights to talk about the Republicans and Brett Kavanaugh I Am shocked I Am shocked at the media doesn't ask her about Juanita Broderick it as easy to ask her\nAbout Monica Lewinsky for those of you who don't know Juanita Broderick she is a strong woman into survivor who is the author of a book called you'd better put some ice on how I Survived being raped\nBy Bill Clinton\nJuanita thanks for joining us and welcome to the airwaves to Phoenix\nOh thank you for asking\nThank you also for your strength and you're witnessing for standing up for justice justice delayed we've been told is justice denied you're trying to do something about that and we'll get to that just a moment\nI'm Juanita for those of us who became familiar with your story in the late nineties\nWe have always found it a head scratcher and a jaw drop or that\nWhile those in the media that did take the time like we some Myers to investigate your claims and find them more than ... very very credible that they just never really attached\nIn any serious way to Bill Clinton I Wonder if you if it's not too uncomfortable for you might take a couple of moments and tell us the story that you became very well known for in the late nineties [noise]\nOver here in the uh uh nine age I was a\nOut and buy the polish jokes or you know I had to remain quiet for so many years and I just uh I didn't want to come forward and I I was to fry it and then in Nineteen Ninety eight hours like I said out is by the fall a journalist or I probably never would've got bored because\nI was fearful um but after that happened I was I was very upset and uh I did not declined and the olive Jones third and I thought that would be the end of it and I could stay out of it and go on go on with a lot a lot but as history shows\nI were a deposed by ... stars you know the independent counsel and just before a hours to be interviewed by the animal\nOr my son came journey and he had known about the right\nOr that it was about Eighteen or not getting any regime was in an attorney uh uh in Ninety and Ninety eight\nAnd he said mom you got to go ahead and tell the truth is ... ... this this theory is is the Paula Jones food was too old and I understand why you didn't want to go forward but you have to come forward now\nSo that when they're really came out uh uh all of my allegations against Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton\nYeah say something about what Hillary Clinton your experience with Hillary Clinton\nOh my gosh it was terrible uh about three weeks well distorted clarify I had worked in Bill Clinton's campaign for governor I was a nursing home owner and a registered nurse and I thought it would be interesting so I had a about three weeks prior to the right\nI had volunteered got around put up yard signs\nAnd was very active in the local county can pairing and during the time uh I arranged a fundraiser with my friends or their name was crushed oil\nA Mr Chris well with Dr Critchlow with my dad does and Betty his wife and I play tennis together so I had helped arrange refinery stricter Bill Clinton that their own\nLuckily home or in here\nAnd then after the right I hadn't decided you know I Would no longer volunteer I wanted nothing to do with the campaign\nAnd about three or four weeks later the fundraiser a arrives to and I had completely forgotten about it sure and Betty calls and says you know I Need the donors list and many other things I said okay I'll run those up to your\nUh before the meeting starts but I don't feel well and I'm not going to be able to stay for the main thing\nI did not want to come in contact with Bill are Hillary so I went up about thirty or forty five minutes early\nAnd gave her the information and gave the lady from this day and donors list that came up a chair that fundraiser and before I could get out of their uh I see them coming during the ... kitchen and as I had to the front door\nA Hillary Clinton will come straight farm the and just before she did that one of my friends a local pharmacist is name which\nChalk watch he rushes over Jimi he was the one that has driven from the airport and he comes over to me and he did not know about the right people didn't know he was a huge Clinton supporter and they said the topic of the conversation all the way from the airport was the Clintons asking me\nInformation about you\nJust sort of rose I just\nI thought my God I've got to get out of here as soon as he turned ... farm me\nAnd as she walks me that I thought oh my God here comes that for a wall and water on earth and I go on despite her right well and that was the big guys anyway she comes over to me tries to take hold my hand and says\nI just want you know have pre should get the bill and I are for everything your during his can time and I couldn't not it I could have stayed thank you but I turned to walk away I just had to get out of there but before I could\nUh someone grabs me from behind and I think even when I turn around it's her ... and she got a horrible look on her side than a brown and she pulls me down to her and she says during your understand\nEverything you do and I almost buying it I could not believe this woman was threatening me but that's exactly what she was doing and at that moment in time I really felt like she knew what had happened to me\nMhm mhm and you took that as a threat obviously as anyone more\nOh absolutely if you're seeing are getting meaner er and the way she looked at a grant me it was that it was frightening\nSo I Know this is tough to answer but uh I've been reading the stuff you've been writing on Twitter and saying elsewhere when you see the um hoopla for lack of a better word a from the likes of ... ski and MSNBC and on CNN\nWhen they play up the story of Stormy Daniels as she tells that um and they\nOnce in a while we'll bring up the story of Monica Lewinsky with Hillary Clinton they never go beyond Monica Lewinsky what is your sense of this ... what is your thought process\nOh ... no one when they have are in that predicament that no one\nWill ask Hillary Clinton what about Broderick wanted out Cathleen oily water out Leslie meal wait they will not delve into that and I do not understand why\nWell I I I think I understand why which is you you you you women you ladies are inconvenient to their political perspective I think that's what it frankly comes down to don't you don't you think it it it it's a it's selective political desire\nWell I I like to call it and got a fair enough I'll take care of all I just\nYou know I mean they are finally realizing the Democrat I mean more and more every day are finally realizing that I've been telling the truth or this past Twenty years but they just don't want to accept it\nYeah I think the one who can or you because this I was saying before you came on the show a Juanita we are talking to one meter Broderick\nAuthor of you better put some ice on that how I Survived being raped by Bill Clinton what I was saying is anyone who has looked at or into your story comes away flabbergasted that this actually is as you said it I'm from Lisa Meyers on down\nAnd that's why I think they just they just want to ignore you I don't think they want to get into it because it's uncomfortable for them and their politics\nWell I'm just hoping that we can get into it as you probably staying in Detroit or I had a fish\nYeah I was going to ask you about that there is I think people can do it in and we love to give people homework so go right ahead\nYeah I had a big issue with the White House and I needed a hundred thousand signatures it's creeping toward\nForty thousand it alone it but I Need a hundred thousand in order for the White House to approve and investigating Bill Clinton not for just line for all of his sex crimes\nNow this is important even though the statute of limitations on his crime against you has taken has has already come and gone it's still important because there are still issues at play here right\nShowing exactly that this man as a former president draws ... of dollars every year from our actors and I would love to be able to be\nA perks strict for him\nNothing else I mean like you said the statute of limitations had all gone and I'll never say satisfaction\nAbout style and decided I Would love to see a a strict fan base for\nAn wall Stormy Daniels his book is at Walmart I'd like\nThinking more the alphabet news type people like ... like the regular news programs and but just rolling sample and I saw the view from mostly fall off with Donald Trump yeah uh it was very much to go out to she had a kitten cured had when she spoke with John McCain\nI remember that shoe is with ... you know I thought I Would have this other shops I Know chap stick for her less than ... bought\nI understand what you're saying they are two very different um two different interviews when it's George Bush or whether it's bronco bomb or whether it's Donald Trump or whether it's Joe Biden or Iraq Obama you're absolutely right it comes through\nI thought I'm you know Donald Trump took some criticism for his interview on sixty minutes but I've talked to people who aren't naturally Trump supporters are not you know maybe where you are where I Am\nAnd they thought he was just fine and they thought what right does it would you know why she demanding why is she demanding concessions from him you know when he said things like I'm not going to declare it to you and and and and you know he gave up\nAs as as good as he got they they all thought that was right they kind of thought she was over the line\nSo you know it's a weird thing about a lot of people worry about when Donald Trump gives an interview but there's some kind of basic kind of\nThere's two things that go on when he does it one of them\nIs the media so overreaction over steps that I think it comes through to most independent minded people I think yeah I think their their their arrogance and aggression shows through um so I I think they they mailed their hand when with the style to interview him on a with and the other thing is\nI'm Donald Trump doesn't\nReally come off like he's you know trying to pacify them or try to pull the wool over their eyes he just comes off like you know in every man if you will and I think people tend to appreciate that so when he said something that might be offensive or\nA you know might raise the uh the hackles in the eyebrows of\nOf the professional a conservative journalist class if you will but you know what so what the the they're they're not to vote matters I think most voters see Donald Trump speak and see him when he is interviewed and they say you know that's kind of the job I Would do that's kind of me\nYou know they look Donald Trump and they say you know that's kind of me which is an odd thing to say about a billion everybody has that Mac\nAnd someone they may have had a lot more economic let's say I'm association or affiliation with while he was president not since but while Brock Obama I think it was harder to relate to him\n[noise] I think there are ... ... ... ... ... ... says on the line says ... civil civil\nUnions and the wider wallet
