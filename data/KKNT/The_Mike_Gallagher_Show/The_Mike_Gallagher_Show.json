teach our children that you know not every toys their toys [laughter] I always love it when you go to a party and the hubs it's your kids or someone else's birthday part of the kid goes and he your kids watch every toy\nThat the birthday kid has because they haven't been taught right they grow up selfish everything is about them when they're babies everybody's a doting on them and falling all over them so that's a key difference certainly between\nI think not only the religious and secular but the left and the right the people are not basically good did you hear all the time with the left that\nOh you know you got to be understanding of the murder or you got to be understanding of their background and stuff oh yeah there is a real issue about whether the people would be good if left to their own devices and what is Dennis always caught something about the German tribes I think an Eighteen century\nOr they were so powerful and committed such evil and the answer was because they could\n[noise] so it's important to have a guardrail ths were good behaviors are defined and bad behaviors are outlawed\nOutlawed or even more importantly prohibited by ... by a garbage will have to answer to that that is so crucial because if you don't think\nThere is something or somebody that we have to answer to win this is all over it than anything goes right into your own moral compass that counts and yeah there are a lot of good people that have good morality and then you know they would never heard anybody\nBut I don't trust that I that otherwise you would never get slavery otherwise you would never get genocide\nYou can't believe people to their own devices so that's why we have laws but even more importantly if you think there is a good job that you're going to answer to win this is all over I think that produces ... much better but have you I think it's obvious\nUh so that's why I say born could behaviors or to find them bad behaviors are outlawed or prohibited by a God that you have to answer to [noise]\nSo what are we had we had fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers and sons and daughters they did not come home Saturday\nYou know you you are you going to a synagogue and you think you have some sanctuary to use that phrase\nAnd and what was his two brothers I mean I Can't even watch or listen to the details 'cause it's too depressing and a lot of them older right it is just that you know they go about their business they don't bother anybody else and purely because of their religion\nThey are murdered by an evil guy who made it very clear right he's anti Semitic you know all Jews should be\nKilled I guess is what he's you know I'm paraphrasing what was going on purely because I I think he was upset because they were uh [noise]\nYou know part of a group that was helping immigrants come into this country even illegal immigrants send Neal here my position I'm sure during the day about illegal immigration\nOne can be outraged about politics and not do what antifa does not do what the pipe bomb or does whatever site he winds up being on it it looks like he was on the you know the other side but who knows it doesn't matter even though as evil matter what you want to say\nBut it's hard to imagine the pain of it all\nBut our I Will you know the difference Dennis ... leave religious discussion for him when he when he gets back\nNo one's better than Dennis on that in my opinion\nBut I sure hope that there is good God waiting for them\nAnd that family members can find some solace that way I Want to know your thoughts at one a prayer seven seven six but the worst part is probably not the worst part worst part is what happened to these people but I mean and I don't mind issue here is what the media and others have tried to do to blame Donald Trump\nThat she's a she's the atmosphere that he has not only accept it but uh you know in some way encourage\nHas led to evil as if it's first of all as if it's only on our side right they conveniently forget Steve ... and and that the guy there but it was a Bernie Sanders supporter as I remember and he he was committed total my ham right if not for the Capitol police that happened to be there with some of these congressmen\nShe would have wiped them all out let alone Steve Sebelius who you know almost succumb to his injuries but and I saw it all over the place that was a a\nFormer Obama official interviewed on Fox News let alone to the guy didn't even challenge from the news host on the weekend didn't even challenged him when he said oh you know comes from the top down and the kinds of things he says and it kind of things he encourages his supporters to do that's why we have this kind of violence when it's been going\nAn forever not to mention that and and you certainly uh you can't just blame the president for any particular supporter of his that commits man whether it's the pipe bomber or in fact been this guy think winds up being anti Trump\nMy right he's ... he's on the other side it doesn't matter they're off to get the president at every turn whatever he does is got to be bad and it's part of the you know\nHe he's the worst president never should have been elected uh he's evil he's a bumbling fools all those characterizations they hate him with a passion\nSo everything that happened in this country that is bad\nIs President Trump's fault and everything that happens that is good that President bombs credit to his credit if you don't believe that just ask and he'll tell you that [noise]\nSo this is what we have going on it and you you can't avoid politics even in something so awful here and even some of the rabbis there was a march\nIn my neck of the woods in the San Fernando valley and you could just hear at all which is the spirit of the country and the sea encourage meant to this kind of thing from the even if they didn't say his name you know who they were talking about and I know what happened\nI bet you all of you out there and knew that it would happen that one way or another they were going to blame him for anything that happened including people who are against him none of it matters and we'll get into\nThis later I I think in this first I Want to talk about the media and the press oh what they've done to this present butter relates here relates here to these family members um that will never come home again because of the anti Semitism\nUm look this is the greatest country in the history of the world but there are going to be evil people in it they're all going to be crazy people there are going to be this is what I say a two blacks who say that as a you know\nHatred and bigotry against them and uh the racism in this country yeah you you can't outlaws you can't get rid of it totally they're always going to be people like that\nAnd there's nothing you can do you just ... and here's the other thing in this horrible incident thought ... luck plays a lot in life\nThat are the you know I think some there's always someone who doesn't go for some reason and then they have to think the rest of their lives why wasn't of my time [noise]\nSo it it it's very difficult as I said and you you can't imagine what these family members of going through I'm In it and it's not just them is ah the remember the black church\nWhere the guy comes in and whatever his name was any they just kills people because they're black which is meaningless being black tells you nothing about someone\nOr being Jewish tells you nothing about their values and who they are being Christian right Christians are under attack in this country that's the one group that it seems to be okay you can attack them you can get away with it right 'cause it's okay in this country\nAnd I had to admit his challenge was more than fair and I couldn't really answer me except for what I'm kind of thought of afterwards it might be good\nFor the sake of the country not to put everyone through such a trial can you imagine the outcry and the further device on this if that's even possible mature that might bring to the country but that doesn't change the fact that the ... legitimate discussion to have about\nWhether she should be tried for crimes especially since you got a free pass\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption at the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for her actions and the cries to lock her up represent the Irish people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people wanted him to go you know he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that this one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so block corrupt is not by any means and incitement to violence\nThe other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people there'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and they're beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate\nThe press not infrequently comes was stores that are not true the latest example did you hear this one NBC was hiding spot Qatari evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's one it's a good one [noise]\nIt seems NBC knew that you didn't even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John\nI think I got something on Shawn he didn't hear that bit of news yeah this so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respective or many of his supporters\nTo media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so they're no longer objective reporters and a part of some sort of left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy\nTo the detriment of the shows so for example out talking about and the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother\nNever mentioned the fact that none of this would happen if a mother's didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that or the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone who's guilty of a crime catch this shelter also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother a father [noise]\nHow come that's hardly ever Porter by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener so the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she lives on Fox ... use even though he more picked on them\nAnd saw at all it's all they lacked the proper documents to come to this country or your house or take your bank accounts they just don't have the right documents\nSo of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports and so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people and not allowing them to make their own decisions\nLet me know what you think I think this is a big part of the issue he's right let me know what you're saying\nWhen a predator seven seven six mark guys lumber Dennis [noise]\n[noise] here's a million fixing\nSort of go by the shooter as of a hospital for this

some more ATF more bones in stocks\nAnd I say that is not a plan I'll say it loud and clear okay to me asset allocation is what do we need the money to do do we needed to be a paycheck now do we needed to be\nMoney in five years that we're going to use to buy a car do we need it to be long term money that's going to be there if we need it for health care many years from now do we need it for an emergency fund if tomorrow the air conditioner goes in\nIn Arizona and we need to buy a new unit because we don't have time to find out if the guy who was telling us we need a new unit is you know is telling the truth or not we now have a new unit right to fix it [laughter]\nTo me that the asset allocation because we're going to use different tools like remember it tells you a while back that when we built our first house used a rock to hang pictures ... ruining my pictures well enough that's not a good tool\nTo me at a bank and mail it to the wall you want to use him both the same thing with asset\nReal I mean if you have too much risk we probably want to look\nFor different tools okay so for example if like most people if you're you got a real law in the stock market and it's all for appreciation okay\nThe market goes up you got a great paycheck that if the market goes down you're selling off shares that you're never going to get back but you really need that to be reliable income mhm if you want to stay in stocks maybe you want to be more dividend producing stocks\nYou want to do something that whether the market goes up or down you're getting a income from it\nMaybe one or just being a conservative portfolio that focuses on income that's what I'm Talking things that will generate into whether the market's up donors side with because that's what we're trying to accomplish that emergency fund in today's environment I'm hard pressed to tell you that I wouldn't want to see some money\nIn a bank account or a CD or a money market just they're safe and sound so you can write that check sometimes people use a home equity line of credit to do that and it's low interest rate environment\nBut the key word there is some money because there are people who you know they they are worried about volatility they use what happened in two thousand natives are as a reason to keep their money locked up in ultra safe thing to sit in on these savings\nAccounts your saying some money there yeah and but not all good\nPoint and I'm so glad you brought that up because the other side of the spectrum is having everything\nEarning no money then yeah we call that going broke safely ... that's what's happening you will never get your money to catch up with inflation then that's another reason for that risk analysis even if you're on the back let's figure out you know what you need that money to do that's why you need the analysis\nTo see do I need to position things different like we don't certainly you shouldn't\nRisk all your money as well you should not have all your money sitting there earning max\nTo two percent because inflation's gonna just a road that you're never going to keep up with the cost of health care very very very good point so asset allocation according to your plan planned first asset allocation\nWhat tools can we use to do the job we need\nThat portion of our money to do okay and and our job is like I said if we want income in the short term there's only a few tools will go to the show you what those tools are will show you the pros and cons and strings attached to each one gives you a high level\nEducational no so you can see where you're most comfortable but we got to know what we need the money to do\nThis a big talk about active versus passive management huh okay what's the difference in that\nVersus passive management passive management is you know the van got approach\nThere's a place for all of this than a portfolio once we know we need the money to do but again active and passes management is just about investing your money and returns mhm of first plan what do we need the money to do\nLet's get the right tool so if we have some we need income in a very complicated market were bonds really their heyday is is is over as interest rates rise bonds have done very very well for a long period of time it's interest rates rise bond values are going to\nGo down that's just the fact of life mhm stock markets volatile\nSo if we need income in the future but we want that money liquid and we don't want to tie it up and in in you know a fixed contract\nMaybe we want we want an active money manager portfolio who understands\nWe want this money conservatively one income from it we do want home runs we want singles yeah the marketing implodes we don't want to upload with the market goes way up we just want some nice income from it that's an active manager they can do whatever it takes to get up there\nAnd that's their expertise that's what they're doing all day every day a passive\nPortfolio and the other hand is here's where we're going to be and here's what we're going to be okay and for a long term money like I'll give you an example of my kids when they're raw mhm I've got them in the S. and P. five\nHundred each year for part of it OK long term\nVery low no hands in the pie no management these were just putting it in there were constantly dollar cost averaging in or they are I shouldn't say maybe they'll think I'm doing it but I Know [laughter] and that's good for that right but if someone needs\nIncome they need\nYou know you can't just do pass it because the markets not passive mhm okay bond markets not pass this dog yeah it's not pass as people think that neutral finance your regular\nUh everyday mutual fund is active management no no not well how to manage man for the stock holders 'cause internally they're buying and selling and generating fees for the stock holders but and the broker dealer\nButton but not really because each mutual fund has a mandate to let me just give you an example it's high yield bond ... totally out\nThe perspective says that that money manager no matter how brilliant they ah has\nTo be in that high yield they have to\nBe at higher bonds they can buy and sell all the time but they get to stay in ... they can't say oh wait a minute inflation's high that's a bad move are going to go to cash but we're going to start\nGoing into real estate investment trust them to go to alternative they're going to stay invested\nAnd so I call that being here in ... that's not active management now if you have a manager who can go can actively move wherever they take to get you what you need that the active management so there's a place for both the portfolio he out first we have to decide what we need the money to do\nWe're talking with Phillip ... founder and president if he SPN associates I generally jak alongside and still is what about its things other than just stocks and bonds are are there tools to include\nFor a at Stratfor a portfolio that that are outside of those traditional stocks and bonds\nYeah so we we believe that that yeah the the old playbook stocks and bonds\nIsn't going to cut that going forward so we need to have some alternative financial products OK okay and I'll just I'll just mention one and and again we're not products and chip where's the Lucian censure but the old playbook of stocks and bonds just is not going to cut it because\nBond value is going to go down when interest rates rise and that's not typical usually stocks will go up on the stocks will go down bond to go up not any more in this low interest rate environment so we need to add\nOther vehicles I could make a very good case if we're looking for income a good alternative to that is some of the money in a annuity strategy okay different types of annuities and they're back but you want a strong company want to understand all the pros and cons and strings attached\nBut that you have some really strong contractual guarantees whether the market's up down or sideways whereas with bonds you could lose value it might be a very very good place for you to do we should do a whole show in the future\nOn annuities because people either love to level or love to hate him because they don't understand yeah hey there's not enough education on them and they're not right for everybody and let me say this if you don't have a plan first please don't buy an annuity please don't buy stock please don't do life insurance have the plan for\nUnderstanding what you need to solve for\nAnd then look to see what tools you can use and I don't care if it's called paper bag\nAnd duties not either good or bad it's either appropriate for your situation with your risk tolerance and what you need to do or not\nThere are different types of annuities so buyer beware but yeah that's a good alternative today\nMany times if especially if people who don't have pensions Social Security optimization really making sure within your tax situation in your overall picture wherever you are in that spectrum\nYou need to pick up the phone and call for the retired fit analysis and that number to call us is six\nTo three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six again six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety ...\nWent either will happen we just do things will happen if we get older you know we never know when the news is going to change but we know there's always going to be news to watching the news it affects our retirement as we get closer to retirement shore yeah we want to make sure that isolates over money from the day to day actions\nOf the foolish view out there that could make the news and then goes there all of us\nOthers to have to\nScramble and wonder if our retirements going to be the way it is just look at September eleventh two thousand one member that you can make the actions of a few idiots changed the world no doubt that may still change the world if he ever\nFly now when we go through all sorts of stuff just to get on the plane we've taken a lot of our liberties away because of what those people that they would bring a drink on the plane the more you can go in the airport in pay\nFive times a year for a while but but it's just about shaping your plan to make sure that regardless of what happens in the future you're going to be fine yeah\nThat makes a lot of him I mean you're talking about liberties taken away their code I can only imagine that you know the volatility of that market can take away your liberty of getting like let's just be a real we all may like that cup of coffee every couple of days or every day and and it can take away that literally that we have as we had an\nUltimate freedom as liberty being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it and and you can have liberty and freedom in retirement if you say your plans up correctly I just the way too many people who were\nBelieving that song and dance of where they currently are or maybe they're doing their own plan and they just said to all their money tied to the market going up ... in ... and it's like a balloon is hot air balloons you see every now and then the memory now and then it starts to say\nYou know and we back the comic book days back in the day or the cartoons when\nWhen the hot air balloon was going down what what is the first thing you do they do the sandbags over whether to retirement plan starts to sink and you're ... you're thrown over the sandbags which is too much risk oh sure but it keeps going down because you waited to all get now there's this new and there's no hot here\nWith me right now out here in the oil is coming down the hot air retirement is income yeah edit refills the balloon\nIn this don't believe those big balloons were talking about refills them so they continue to float and float higher and higher yeah never coming down next door to make sure our income plans are like that too so there are strategies for creating and preserving\nRetirement income and a lot of people are overlooking does we we have something we when we sit down with radio listeners we go through the financial spectrum it's called ... and it goes all the way from bread to green and everything in between and you should have money in each and every one of those categories okay but unfortunately so many people were like the old seesaw they have all their money at risk\nAnd none of safety and none in income\nAnd so it's like the the big fat person on the seesaw sitting there and your way up and they're not coming down you gotta have proper about proper balance has always been the key but what is that what we see that's overlooked so how do you get from wondering if you have proper balance to having that proper ballots where the worries are taken away\nWe have a three step process that encompasses twenty two different steps that go on behind the ... doesn't really wow so three steps I think it's pretty good I like that yet I've never a good dancer but I think they had one called the two step right\nTo do this was one on one more dancer chicken [laughter] but uh it's about having\nThe right income and an income strategy built in any financial plan turns it into a retirement plan and so I Do you you know and brought this I'm adamant about this because a retirement plan is one that has income but so many people out there I think they have a retirement plan because our planet the current financial planner who may or may not be produced cheery keeps telling them everything's fine\nAnd maybe it is maybe it is it but I don't like the word maybe when we're talking about lifetime income no you either have lifetime income that's guaranteed for life that is growing and it gives you income and it's protected or you do there you go there and it was pretty cool it's like flipping a coin either it's heads or tails if it lands on sales in your broker keeps saying that says\n[laughter] try to broker\nYou know or maybe

to root out\nHe is a best selling author winner of many awards including ... again like I said earlier in the program I could go on and on and studio with us as well as Chris the rocket man brought our now\nCoach you were talking about financial dignity before the break and it reminded me I'm going to open up and probably get left out a little bit here [laughter]\nWagon again yesterday when I was a preteen and so you gotta think like eleven twelve year old Thomas there was a band called ... that was back in the day that there were these kids they all had long hair\nSo I had grown my hair out because I thought it was cool and trendy fad I go into a gas station one day to pick up a bottle of pop bottle a coke or whatever and the ah clerk their refers to me as a female instead of the male cut my hair the next day some little dignity example there just to kick off the segment\nUnless your hair comedy is about down on my shoulder and I've seen pictures would you would not much here at all you have yeah is that after the episode [laughter] or tablet eggs on him or her dignity that right right well yeah it's it's on again\nYour terms so financial dignity though you know doing what you want when you want where you want with whom you want that's financial dignity and we see so many people every single week they'd come in from the show we talk to them\nAnd they are wondering if they have what they need put aside and places they should have it to get to retirement they want to have and unfortunately well fortunately or unfortunately unfortunately sometimes they don't but fortunately there are they're thinking about it so that we can get them on that right past mhm we call it a critical thinking\nAnd its benefits we look at the benefits of of what what you're doing right now versus the benefits of something you could be doing ... and that should I mean to its features advantages and benefits and why would you make a decision that didn't benefit you completely and as much as it more of than anything else out there\nYeah I I Would imagine it's just not making the true comparison not not nearly being educated\nYeah we go through what we call the financial stress tests with every single item that is in your current portfolio while and then we compare that to what we would recommend is independent financial produced here as we can go out across the world and find things that makes sense to you know one of the things that are largely I keep seeing it over and over again from people that come in from other planners\nIs these other planners are pushing like crazy these days something called a real estate investment trust otherwise known as a rate OK called rats before to analyze that that is a real estate investment trust is when they're being pushed by financial professionals they get a pretty good commission that's what I Wish that\nAnd many times it comes right out of your return oh okay so if you are right out of the money put into let's say you know what a hundred thousand dollars into a real estate investment trust\nAnd the person you're buying it from is not a true for do Sherry the hundred thousand dollars you put in Ninety One thousand or so goes to work for you guess where the other nine thousand Ghost Wars on guests Tom and I was trying to\nGet on the person sounded okay that makes sense no not at All right so that's a media loss now you have for the year right unless it I mean what's that real estate goes up like crazy now here's the thing that that's bad enough that I think you agree that's bad isn't it and risk does that make you met and data that does I mean that's almost ... percent I went to\nHarris Teeter shopping center to buy a half gallon of ice cream for five dollars\nYou give the person five dollars and of course tax gets on there to see how you get to the person five dollars and fifty cents [laughter] and\nWhat they do is they take your gallon ice cream to take this big knife you see like a ginsu knives [laughter] remember these to cut through the cans with it and then to cut through a tomato I remember the guard against the knife out and they take a tape measure out and they measure one fourth of the ice cream and to cut it off a heart attack and then they put the dripping part\nThat's left the big three fourths into your bag and address over everything up they take that one fourth and they start eating it right in front of you that's equivalent to what happens when the person takes a fee\nAnd ... out of your money that you're trying to test out that's a really good at night they slice it and they slice of the money you put in land somebody because of their pocket some of them go and yours while and so but that's bad enough but another thing is when you buy these real estate investment trust\nThey are it liquid for the most part they are non traded really produce you've heard the phrase non traded read heaven here that\nI have yeah and probably when I met when I'm Talking about you for me you know yet what about you know yeah in that but\nIt's an entree that means if you buy it you can't sell it right or locked okay it's like when you buy silver and gold now but it's the silver and gold at least is liquid because you can sell it back to the person you bought it from short last yeah sure you buy it for a hundred dollars and they'll say well I'm Glad we buy back\nFrom you for night [laughter] I might as much as I should say commissions both ways okay yeah so it would be\nVery careful if someone is peddling a real estate investment trust ask them why and say how does that fit in what I'm trying to do okay sure because they're taking advantage many times with the fact that people know the where they want some real estate in their portfolio and if you want real estate go buy some real estate you can sell tomorrow\nThat's what I was going to ask you know we we hear a lot of people who say advantage of the rental situation it was a ... is very different than okay\nSo we've got this cheat sheet that you can use to end its low gosh one two three four it's got six main topics in east each of those main topics has a sub topics ... forty eight\nDifferent sub topic wow and six main topics but then to be because you need to go through this before you buy something you'd never heard of ... like a real estate investment trust there you go yeah and one of the things that you have to say what what is that what are the strength and what are the weaknesses of that\nBecause many times when people come in and show us what they have all they've heard about the strikes\nA which is hopefully this will go up and that you could sell for a product of what we're doing that like in that sense yeah the maybe the hot so I said hopefully hopefully yeah\nYeah I'm going to get a quick bell but some people said you said maybe\nAnd put it in a place that had growth that future income that protection\nAnd now regardless of what happened to the stock market money\nThey had already purchased their income that we find with for the rest of retirement I Love it and therefore they gave him time to get the money that was exposed to risk that went down to not have to touch it so it could come back up well a lot of overlooked in financial planning will because most most planners tell you to a a will give me your money and I'll do better for you know over here in the war he says the paper ...\n... it's a real loss when people and I've seen people emotionally their their whole attitude towards life changes a hundred eighty degrees when the market's going down\nThere you go well I mean you say it's a pain and loss but then he tried to take that money and go vehicle with it I don't I don't think the dealerships gonna let you give a paper last money [laughter]\nI Know so stage one and when we talk about retirement income planning is ongoing it's always building and always thinking about what's your retirement is going to be and and looking at your tax planning looking at how much money you going to take out what what it's going to be taxable what the taxes could be and looking at what your Social Security when you when you take\nYeah and it stays to is well before retirement six to ten years out we start to tame down or risk or\nWe take some of the money out of the risk and we buy the income now that we want for the rest of our lives that will start when we need it like six or ten years down the road offshore and then we don't worry what happens in the market as much anymore [laughter] we always wore a right where I was ... and it didn't hurt it doesn't hurt to war you know safety pay attention during being proactive\nAnd knowing that things could go the wrong way\nAnd knowing that if it does you've already got your income secured and so you're not going to be very emotional when it comes to the money to still exposed to risk there you go to Amy down the risk of getting managed managed risk and doing that strategic we'll get your money\nMaking sure that you do the calculated risk exposure level on the money that's at risk so based on the risk you're taking how much could you go to the mark and with the wrong way\nAnd then how much in company needs to take some of that money out of the risk account let's get an income plan that will build our money where our money give us the income that we know what the income will be at a certain age in her life for the rest of our life and the rest of our spouse's life\nKnowing that if we pass away too soon that money will go on to our next again so it doesn't lose\nYou can't lose the money yeah sure it's easier for us that were there for somebody else and back in the old days if you if you've got a personal pension like that and you passed away the money was gone\nSo [laughter] but now the world has changed for the better for us if you get with a fiduciary plan or they'll put together a plan that makes sense to you that will give you that lifetime income it'll give you the growth of the market on one side it'll give you the income on the other side it's income planning and it's ... it's what changes there'd be a financial plan into\nA retirement plan it Cinderella is carriage that never turns into a pumpkin think about that there you go yeah you know that that's about twelve o'clock at night you know what to do a book and yeah and that will never turned a bumpy and if you do it right so you never worried about having to get home to see the uh step mom began\nThere you got what we always have you know we always hope for the best and I was talking to you or the other day in the hallway about this coach about uh we're putting some video content together I think for one of the videos that we do on financial ... dot com and I saw a video clips from a news outlet and it was done in like Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand and it was showing the projections of the stock market for the next Twenty years if you\nDon't know that oh eight is going to happen you don't know the oh and I want to get what they call the projections for early [laughter] just like Hillary was projected away let me ask you [laughter] don't let\nMe ask you this do you think a lot of people because you obviously me with folks on a daily basis you and the team upstairs right do you find that most people have these optimistic projections and when you actually run the numbers and they see what actually could happen there is a little bit of the blinds open\nYeah and one of the parts is and that's just one of the stages of retirement planning is looking at what you're going to have yeah the other phases especially when we get like a one year away from retirement especially we need to look at what are expensive they're going to be an retired OK yeah and so we make sure that our income is going to exceed or outcome\nOr I'll go through it and as we want more money coming in for me to talk about before when when you have a truly income plans set up inside your financial plan it turns into retirement plan but an income plan is when the mailman brings you money each year he puts that green flag on the mailbox\nAnd you walk out every every couple of weeks and put red flags on to send your bailed out so you want you want a bigger green flag than all the red flags that it together and therefore you have more income than than money going out and that's a successful retirement that's one that you have\nA peace of mind and you don't have all sorts and you're not worried about turned the TV running home to turn the TV honestly if your retirement a gal still there because of what the market and I believe it or not I know we laugh about it but but I Know a lot of people listening or looking at each other right now saying do we really have\nA retirement plan yeah yeah coach beat of course we establish one coach Pete regional ... says that if if financial plan is only a financial plan until you have income built into it now it is a true retirement plan and that income has to have to have growth\nIt has to have protection and it has to have income guarantees for the rest of your life that is a true\nIncome plan it's now these phony baloney plastic banana cut it reeks that we hear about silver and gold all these fly by night promissory notes only get rich quick schemes it's a real regulated retirement plan there you go and most people don't have that Thomas I think everybody out there needs to review\nThere's three things that happened when we do a review\nNumber one we tell you you're doing great everything's fine I Would not change a thing when the great to get that stamp of approval that's right yes or is that you just need a couple of weeks but you can get right back on the track\nMaybe you're on that train track and then you took the wrong turn and now you just have to reverse a little bit and get back on the real trick on a bad thing or number three either don't have a boy in or the plan or you have that has been misleading you thinking you did ... and then we can do a total rebuild redesign for you in three steps we do twenty two steps behind the scenes it's called our total

and it's also speed related so when you're going slow pitch and then when you're going faster it's different so are you disconnect the cable for in the back of the spin amateur and that's not easy that's something that's difficult to do\nAnd you have to know how to on latch it anyway\nSo you pull this phenomena cable down and you can pull the cables just straight up and almost always you'll find a couple of brown spots on this wire and cable\nAnd Denise brown spots are much bigger than the cable itself to and those are your troubled areas what is it it's just old Greece okay let's just told Greece so you take some carbs spray and you clean up those any dirt Danny imperfections on the cable\nThen when you're done you're sprayed with break spraying the carpet spray leaves a film\nBut break spray cleans the film up came so that's what and carp sprays a lot better cleaner than break clean is so you use those to products then you take some white lithium Greece and you put it in the center of the ... of the palm of your hand in your drag the cable through it\nAnd you just loop the cable then you slide it back in the house if you put it back on the back of this phenomena or if the noise is the same after you've done that then the head on this phenomena or spat came but about eighty percent maybe even higher than that when you lose the cable that will do it\nI Can't tell you when the last time we lose the cable at our shop I just don't remember the last time somebody came in with a noisy noisy us you know spin amateur cable came so it's not something that's real common nevertheless okay well\nHe had an older vehicle any had that\nProblem yes it appears that that's that's what the situation was okay so when we go in and we talk about car repair much of what we talk about has to do with\nSelf defense [laughter] what do you do when you're faced with something that makes you uncomfortable a lot of times folks will take their cars in and they'll say I have a clock when I stop\nAnd then the phone call back might be what your clock as your lower control arm bushes but in addition to that you're ... you have to monitor mounts that are broken and you're way past the poses and belts and along with that goes a lot fluids\nThat's kind of overwhelming yes it is you took it in for just nothing more than a clock\nAnd the clock has ballooned into two thousand dollars worth of repair yes so my advice and and especially to women and you can't really teach guys about car repair cars they all about what it what what what it's all about but for ladies the ladies answer is let's stick with the problem I have\nSo you write all that stuff down that I made but let's stick with the problem I have and let's fix it first I'm a little uncomfortable and all of a sudden it's ballooned to two or three thousand is or how much is the lower\nControl arm pushing that's bad or how much well if one's bad you need to do all four\n... and the and and then then the question is do I really need to do all four right\nAnd and as their savings in labor so can you do all four at substantially less labor and they just do one and there is no in this particular case there is no um opportunity for you to save labor when you pull the lower control arm off it just takes a second to replace want her to ...\nDoesn't take a second but for a short period of time for one versus two tier already ready you got all your equipment there you're punching out the ... the Bush and you're putting in a new Bush and what difference does it make the cost of the Bush and then the little bit of of time so if it takes a hundred and twenty five dollars to take a look and trauma off it's going to take\nTwenty dollars to do the first one I'm ten dollars to do the second one if everybody bills approach [noise]\nYeah so that's the kind of issue it is\nIn in so many words what you're saying is let's fix what I brought it in for and then if I can develop trust and you fix it like you said then you stand the last one I might reward you with some of the other stuff yes the second issue is is\nThe thing that drives me crazy as as I say to you Mrs sailing you need a transmission service and you say well let me look at the owner's manual to see if I'm In that ... mile or time range oh you don't need to worry about them stay on that monitors males not built for Arizona it's not written ...\nThis is that the response to that this is cut them off at the knees kind of response\nOh I'm Sorry they didn't give me an Arizona owner's manual would you order one for me [laughter] I guess there is no such animal they'll never get one and and then at that point you're going to get the person in front of you man or woman a service writer their step and all of a sudden they're dancing because they don't know what to say\nThat they're trained well an ending and all kinds of whether it's the chain stores the independent garages or the dealerships\nThey're trained to sell for and so the whole idea is to bring you in on the Nineteen Ninety five oil change but we need to have a three hundred dollar average ticket price now you and I both know we interviewed somebody not too long ago and he had been working at a quick loop facility\nNow this doesn't paying them all with one brushed but I Do know which one he was working at great so at least the one he said we bring them into the cheap oil change and we just had\nKind of a requirement by management to bring that pick it up to three hundred north to three hundred dollars\nAnd oil change still costs us more\nAh in cost than it does um managed to have five yeah at the end even even if you're in the semi synthetic se\nAnd you're thirty five or forty dollars the five courts have oil to filter plus the labor to do it plus the servers writers time to write up to work or plus parts time to ... it doesn't work laid off yeah we lose money right and so the whole idea is is how she can you go\nAnd if I'm at twenty nine Ninety five for a conventional and the guy down the street wants more business he's\nGonna go less than my twenty nine but he still has a responsibility to himself or to the shop to bring that ticket price up here we go we have ... ... good morning to you what can I Do for you\nMark thanks for taking my call you bet that was in five on the way in the ongoing okay and\nThat was coming to us to stop and I'm applying to break 'em right before I stopped probably five miles an hour to laugh it\nAppears like the pedal releases almost like the anti lock relief [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] well we're not go ahead you\nAren't in analog break time I'm anti lock only when when it's going down the road the abs computer watches the rotation of all four tires\nAnd if it sees one locks up than a dumpster pressure to that tire and then I generally apply pressure again it's almost seamless to the driver so what I hear you saying as you're coming in and just to the very end you feel something in the brake pedal\nOkay can you duplicate it every time yeah okay I I don't know what that is\nYeah I've never had a fading or anything it's\nMore of a ... he's talking about the ... movement in the panel yeah and I'm not quite sure how many miles or on your on boy\nI think it's got about a hundred and sixty thousand and um it's almost like it it doesn't really it's almost like it feels like it or leave\nFor a tiny bit not totally um yeah it's very noticeable and other people felt that all that one I use a heavy application on a lighter ...\nOkay I'm going to think out loud here ... have you had breaks on it in a hundred and sixty thousand miles\nYeah I mean I've only had it for about a year so I haven't changed mouth but they love of it is\nOkay and ... it I I was hoping for you and you don't know 'cause I Know you don't know 'cause you just bought it but um it it typically would have been through two sets of issues are three\nUm depending on who's driving it and stuff like that I'm thinking I'm Wondering if the rear breaks or an adjustment\nI'm Wondering if the rear breaks are releasing because they're real loose now he probably has four wheel disk and so there's a process to adjust the brakes on like the process we had when we had were drum where you've backed up and slammed on the brakes that helped adjusting\nSo on this breaks you can't here's what I Want you to try I don't know the answer to your question what part of the town do you live\nIn Phoenix okay on the east or west to central\nUh west central okay actually no I'm Sorry just about central I guess you'd say seven minutes after eight or twelve street and then they'll close by\nIt's not too bad okay Kelly Clarkson twelfth street in Glendale my advice to you um would go and talk to Jesse and say\nBut if it had to do with the four tires the bearing the drive shaft it would change dramatically when you've backed off the throttle\nAnd it would be there and and if it's a ... or anything to do with the four tires on the ground it would be there all the time\nSo it's difficult to to assign that but you know noises and vibrations are kind of tough to diagnose over the telephone ... is there any vibration related to this or not\nYou know okay okay I I I don't have a clue what part of town you live in\nA minute or tell us and ... ...\nOkay we'll eighty eight yeah well that's way far away from eighty eight unveil and may be way north um you could do to to as soon as tire which is on I tenant dice are\nAnd you could just say to them would you be ... I I can make this noise happened couldn't I borrow one of your technicians for ten or Fifteen minutes because if you take him out and you keep them for forty five minutes that really makes us owners mad\nBut if you can take them in that show the noise and then switch places with them and let him driving and make the noise then you're you're you're going to save yourself\nFifty dollars at least fifty dollars or maybe more in diagnostic time if you can pull that off\nAll right I'm Sorry I Wish I Hope you're better thank you very much Brad six oh two five await zero nine sixty six oh two five await zero nine sixty ... repairs I Seventeen and bell to give you an example and let's transition to Kurtz as far as you know what it is that ...\nThat he does he's the kind of guy that would handle that was no problem he's got he's a master tech Eric semester tech Jeff semester tech and those guys are hard\nYou can't draw to a better group of guys right but but test driving a car for a customer is is something we enjoy yeah we don't chase our tale that way\nThey called it this week when it's really rattled or and and the squeak denotes two pieces of metal rubbing together but at this is really a rattle and then you find out that the trouser broken and the shroud is rat leaving the fan hits it's an ... you know there's just a lot of things that can go on there so if you're up\nNear I Seventeen and bell than than Kurds auto repair northeast corner has been around since Nineteen eighty seven is ASC master certify technicians like I told you he's he's been around a long time and he's a good guy and\nI remember one time a lady had been bit three or four motors from two or three different shops and everybody said it needed a motor and I think he fixed it for less than a hundred dollars 'cause they had to do with an oil pressure switch that was showing zero oil pressure\nSo can you imagine putting four thousand dollar engine then and then really put me forty dollar oil pressure censor on knowing full well you're taken advantage of that person\nI'd make you sick and that's like ... I don't know this story was funny to me that we had a lady command last week and she said I'm\nIn my car fixed or whatever and and and he said well what's wrong with it and she said well I don't know or what what are you hearing or nine oh just have them Dr phil now\nAnd then he goes well like what are we looking for now just kept on guy that they'll figure it out and she said no we need some kind of direction what noise your hair and cause for us it might be different than what you hear\nThat happens a lot yeah that happens a lot it's it's an uncomfortable situation with respect to\nWe're not we we may fix the wrong choice right so ... it's ... you really have to drive it and say there's only ...

Mike yeah like [noise] I don't sound a little peculiar\nBut I always look for signs where there's something as important as the mid term election coming along powers looked for some sign and I went through this twenty sixteen and I remember very distinctly what happened I was looking for a sign that\nBoy ... going to win\nAnd it was a if you remember no one gave him a chance I mean it was really silly how what was it Ninety two percent was the likelihood that Hillary was going to win a court in New York\nTimes and I kept looking for a sign\nI kept saying something's gonna come along right before the election but it's going to give me hope but he's got a chance of winning the other words if somebody's going to know something that we don't know and if you listen to my show in twenty sixteen you remember what it was\nThere was a little blurb and the New York post reported that Hillary Clinton who was going to have her big victory celebration at the Javits convention center because if it's big glass ceiling you know a woman breaking through the glass ceiling and be elected president of the United states and all of that\nShe had a fireworks display plant and\nThey were going to shoot off fireworks along the Hudson River after she claimed her inevitable victory and a couple of days before the election there was a little blurb for the New York post\nThat\nBlacks\nPlanes that the Hillary campaign had quietly pulled the permits for the fireworks display and cancelled the fireworks display and I read\nThat you you are there I remember saying to you I think this is a sign I'm telling you this is a good sign they know something they know how silly it is to order hundreds of thousands of dollars maybe millions of dollars worth of fireworks as she could lose\nThe Hillary campaign know knew she could lose and of course we all know she did here's my little fireworks story two weeks before the midterm election President Trump's approval rating according to a brand new NBC Wall Street Journal poll is out\nIf the highest level that he's ever had in this poll it's forty seven percent\nAnd there is a very intriguing aspect to that number\nPresident Trump's approval rating before the midterm elections\nIs now officially at a higher level then former President Obama's was ahead of his twenty ten mid term elections in other words\nPresident Trump is now more popular according to a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll that will that broke rock Obama was at the exact same time uh both of their presidents these\nBlood that sink in blue let that sink in\nI'm going to do something very similar to twenty sixteen because frankly I there's a lot of optics that are the same there's a lot of the same things at stake this is a crucial election\nWe must hold the house we must hold the Senate and as we see this onslaught of thousands and thousands of migrants\nCrashing through border fences and entering Mexico and threatening to invade the United states as we see this happening unfolding before our very eyes I like our chances as we somehow\nSaw Brett Kavanaugh I'd get confirmed by like our chances as we see people yelling at a leader McConnell in a

of the big issues is a is a concern in the issue of drug prices there's a origin\nFrank lunch pull out that revealed the eighty percent of Americans think drug prices are on reasonably high the American people believe drug makers are putting profits ahead of patients\nDo you know Americans spend forty percent more on prescription drugs and Canadians and that our medication and prescription drug costs just keep ... guy rocketing farmers spend more money on lobby than any other industry in America over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars worth the American people believe that the system is rigged\nAnd it's weird because of the big drug makers undue influence with their lobbying dollars\nYou know the fact of the matter is the monopoly pricing power of the drug makers can only be countered by action in Congress drug makers have\nTo be held accountable there needs to be accountability but the skyrocketing costs of drug of our medications Americans want accountability drug pricing and we want Congress to take action\nThe prevailing sentiment that we see in all the polls is enough is enough is enough already Americans want these solutions to prescription drug affordability didn't want them now it's time to hold the drug makers accountable put the patients ahead of profits\nThey have their lobbyists\nAnd there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories in our votes\nIt's time to end the drug makers monopoly pricing power and stop them from overcharging the American people as time once and for all the ... patients a head of ... we will be telling you how to do that in the days and weeks to come you're going to be very impressed with this partnership that we are proud to roll out with you know that's all coming up I promise a

Trump at a forty seven\nPercent rating higher than Obama was during this stage of his presidency and twenty ten shaky what's up\n[noise] hey thanks aren't sure I'll just just occurred mayor when you were talking about that back\nI Believe that Charles oh they're all ordered father Robert girl was over report it starts\nIn two thousand you're dealing with the Obamacare failure dealing with that and God and the Democrats got slaughtered in terms that concern you at all\nOh my gosh Ben ... was a blip on the radar for the mainstream media are you kidding me\nThe only people that were covered Ben ... were were conservative media outlets that are that bothered or dared to go up against the Hillary narrative on that the media gave that big pass it was a giant yawn an Obamacare for the mainstream media\nWas a you know like a curing cancer good thought that was the greatest thing in the world\nNo not even not even a little bit no comparison no comparison whatsoever you look at the polling numbers though and I I Want to go back to the story about this is really interesting analysis from that of all places CNN [noise] this is an analyst or analysis rather from a CNN reporter\nThe house for cash is that the Democrats win two hundred and twenty six seats and the house majority Republicans were only when two hundred nine seats\nThe forecast percentage and this is a CNN talking now [noise] although we haven't generally presented a percent probability the model that we have showing that Democrats hold the house I mean take over the house is about Seventy two percent chance\nSo Harry and to know Regina and says\nIt's not as if all hope his last Republicans indeed I Would point out that it's important to watch the margin of error it's still gives Republicans a decent chance of maintaining control\nAgain remembering that the model gives Democrats about Seventy two percent chance of winning control the house that's among the lower chances than most models give but it's in the general ballpark he asks do you know who else had about Seventy two percent chance of winning\nYou guessed it Hillary in twenty sixteen\nHe says it's not too difficult to paint a scenario in which the Republicans maintain control of the house maintain control the house rather not say Republicans with all those seats where they are favored as well as the streets were democratic candidates lead by about a point or less in the CNN forecast\nThat would leave Republicans with two hundred and twenty seats\nRadio news hour on Sunday afternoons at three on nine sixty the

here that I have I have appreciated ... people are this is the America that I that I I really like\nStuffed a wise guy America the hyper sophisticated fools that um habits so many of our urban areas that have gone to graduate school too long and becomes stupid\nSo that's my that's my initial take\nI hey everybody not just stupid callous jaded mean but other than that I think a case producing terrific people yeah\nBeen be so why does it now seven thousand have you seen pictures of the caravan coming in from largely from Honduras\n\nLike to talk to somebody about how many uh how did they get through the Mexican border the Mexicans just don't care I I keep remain conflicting reports that it's not clear to me they only let six hundred forty and then there are seven thousand so is it six hundred forty years at seven thousand [noise]\nAnd it's it looks like seven thousand to me it's a mile long and again the question\nIs how they just got such a large group get through Mexico not that I think Mexico cares a that was a substantial part of their population lives in the United states in ... Mexico they send back billions of dollars and\nWe take her to the unemployed off Mexico's hands I mean we're essentially that we're a little silly every government of Mexico me and my other states and the left thinks that that is a terrific thing even though all it does is in ... the Mexicans to avoid confronting their own issues\nIf every country could send all those who are not employed or all those who are unhappy to another country why should you deal with any of your problems but hey that's you know\nThat that pales that question pales in significance compared to the possibility of more Democrats\n'cause if you can't make enough Democrats in your own population you need to import Democrats so that you can win more elections that's what they do the imports Democrats\nMet an amazing thing is that done anywhere else in the world and the democracy we import millions of people in order to have you with elected\nThat's what it's about [noise]\n[noise] and it's a it's a big question we should have some folks on because the big question here how are they going to be stopped she misses me my fear is that\nThey will obviously they will have to be physical stoppage of people but not going to come to the border and they'll say please turn around okay we'll go back a thousand miles or Seventeen hundred miles out of I don't know what to distances back to Honduras\nBy the way I just want to add I feel for every one of these people like totally feel for them\nTo live in Latin America is largely to live in a corrupt society\nSo it's a fascinating thing we're supposed to we're supposed to do with knowledge that they should come into the United states because things are so terrible for them but if you say why things are so terrible for them then the left accuses you obscene a phobia or racism\nSee they're really fleeing wonderful places where where there is little corruption and great opportunity they just prefer California 'cause they they like our beaches but of course they have beaches was on the wrist is not landlocked to the bus to my knowledge\nSo I I don't ah\nI I have\nTo live in this make believe world that are on the left is created there's no difference between American culture Latin American culture no none whatsoever American culture was not superior and the moral weight to Latin American culture\nBut everybody wants to flee vast numbers want a fleet they're equally wonderful cultures to come to our less wonderful or equally wonderful or non wonderful culture get it that's what you're supposed to believe if you are college educated\nThere's no difference there's no moral distinction between Latin American the American culture that's amazing I guess while you are so many Americans fleeing to under us\nWhy should they be why should they be impoverished they have food they've perfectly perfectly acceptable\n\nNatural resources the reason Latin America is largely an economic failure is because it's largely corrupt\nAsk our friends in Brazil\nIs is is there a few as ... as intelligent industrious people was the Brazilians but they're mired in corruption corruption is is the greatest problem outside of Iran on the face of the earth\n\nNot global warming my friend's corruption but nobody wants to talk about it because it sounds like you are attacking another culture but I Am attacking another culture I'm not attacking another race or another ethnicity or\nRace or ethnicity or insignificant culture is everything\n\nSo I I don't know what will happen at the border I I don't know how they will be stopped they have but otherwise if you want them in that you are allowing to yourself and to everybody else if you deny your for open borders seven thousand people want to come in\nThat seven thousand more voters plus there plus their families Steve this is the Democrats this is awesome\nI listen to the political pundits who are divided\nThis list will the scene being good and we were approaching this hugely hugely nation changing election possibly\nThe American people choose a Democratic House you are going to just see a two years of hate filled investigations of of the presidency to try to bring him down to try to bring removed justice\nKavanaugh that's all it will be will do nothing for the United states who will do everything for left wing power\nThe left brings not interested in the United states and its interested in power this is true in every country since lemon now talking about liberals but liberals are cowards they don't fight the left except Alan Dershowitz and and and the Ruben and a few others [noise]\n[noise] [noise] that's the state of things this uh this Monday I won't give me the show one aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six so the question is who ... better or worse for Democrats or Republicans\nIf you want an open border it looks better for a for the Democrats if you believe that the United states has to protect its sovereignty it's better for Republicans\nThat's the answer but the point is they will undoubtedly be somebody will get hurt I it's very hard to imagine no young man is going a scuffle\nWith any American border enforcement agent and then get hurt and and uh perhaps a child there will be more cameras there as many cameras there was people\nAnd then the what they will be there will be the usual from the left look what look at the mean spirited president that we have\nTo look at these men and women and children though it's mostly young men but look at these men and women and children the cow\nIs missing Gina phobia of this administration that's that's what you hear and they will they will have the you know the appropriate assigned or so appropriate images that they will be able to show on\nCNN and MSNBC ABC CBS NPR PBS db ... do you do you do you do\nThat's what it is\nAnd the what's the excuse for those born in America to have these left bring values but I Want to know why telling you every single Republican running for office must be asked would you allow the seven thousand people to come into the country\nYes or no it's not a tough question it's tough for you to answer but it's not a tough question\n\nWhen a Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six Ryan and little added Georgia hello Dennis Prager here [noise]\n[noise] um well\nI heard you talking

I I'm thinking about people being held the restaurants and shouted down and Hillary saying there can be no civility until we the Democrats when she said until we win in November\nWe never act that way we never do that to other people we never we would never do that and we wouldn't accept it there is a stark difference between the way people on the right and and in fact many independents react and the way these activists\nI'm behave and punish the ... the fact is the the the lack of denunciation by Democrat leaders or the lack of condemnation over some of this agree just behavior it's a it's a it's a powerful indictment on the Democratic party of twenty Eighteen\nIt is very revealing certainly to the degree that we can dramatize and make them pay a price on the ballot box we should but I Would go beyond that in saying that if they stopped getting even more out of hand\nWhich I think it's quite likely particularly if the Democrats don't win the house Republicans hold a house in the Senate and then we're on the twenty twenty [noise] um\nI don't expect to get worse and I think what it means is that a certain candidate particularly the the schools by Berkley trust me I have to end

much of a popular and I'm certainly not a representative who coal country I mean I grew up in ... in Georgetown so it's basically people who have thrive under our current economic system if you want to know\nIf you eat you know if you look around and you and the people you know are richer than they were before the financial crisis of two thousand eight you know you're probably in that group and it's not a word you know every society higher hierarchical because people are hire me dogs are higher males are\nSo you're always going to have a relatively small number of people who were the questions that are you going to have a ruling class the question is are they upped the task of ruling in my argument is that the people currently in charge or not and that's why we got Trump\nOkay so so ... has a very heavy stuff there let me let me dissect this for a second ruling class for you is an economic criterion not a political or prestigious criteria\nWell it is both in his boat [laughter] if you look around the country to three hundred and thirty five million there almost an infinite number of decisions he made about how those people live what they can say what you are living in a relatively small number of people\nMake a disproportionate number of those decisions so the economic decisions are made disproportionally in New York on Wall street in Washington by the Federal Reserve the political decisions are made almost exclusively in Washington the citizens about what your kids watch on TV or see on the Internet\nOr made almost exclusively in California and New York and Los Angeles and so you know the west side of LA has a lot more influence over the country than the west side of the I mean that's the way I don't I'm not saying that's bad\nJust saying if you have more influence over how other people live you ought to consider yourself a steward of the country and you want to make wise decisions not just decisions than you and our leadership hat and that's\nOkay what what in your mind was there a time when the elite were steering the ship in a good direction\nWell I mean you know democracy you need to start with on personal sort of democracy must have it's correct was it for a functioning democracy that you have an independent self supporting\nGrowing middle class you have to have a middle class democracy only works in middle class countries that doesn't work and said Venezuela where you have this dramatic wealth divide because you could give every person the code\nNot an economic franchise they punish you by electing people like Hugo Chavez for Nicolas Maduro so you need you need to know what you can judge\nThe ethic of seeing the wisdom of the ruling class by how well the middle class people beneath them are killing and our middle class are shrinking in absolute terms her life expectancy is in decline and so that was the most simple measure there is that's all you need to know middle class is no longer a majority of two thousand Fifteen\nAnd the people in shark ought to be worried about that they're not\nAll right so there were ... or the identical issues the decline of the middle class and ethnic and tell me this is a fair summary of your view a corrupted elite\nWell I think that's probably slightly more complicated and I think there are factors that I don't understand very precisely I mean\nNothing results at one cause of course that's always an oversimplification is always the problem when you're reading about this stuff so I mean I'm sure there's a lot going on our economy has changed in ways because of automation on the rise of finance or the product of no one person's decision I mean this is not a conspiracy I Would say\nBut it's a it it's a confluence of a bunch of different factors that have converged to hurt the middle class to devalue labor so that the labor of the individuals were much less than it was it Ninety seven because\nOf automation and technology and all of that\nHas made the average person less powerful laugh at one and the less likely to believe that his kids will do better than he will have which is of course the American dream\nThat makes our society more volatile and are ruling class job it is to think about stuff like this and to steer the ship in the right direction has ignored all of it has refused to take responsibility for their decisions refused to admit they're even a ruling class or even in charge\nAnd and and that's why we're seeing about ... I mean one big changes which is so striking to me as someone who's interested in the aggressive movement\nAnd Teddy Roosevelt and and the Arab robber barons what the Carnegie Rockefeller ships and you know the people who we think on that you know the fat cats Nineteen fifty they understand themselves to be the ruling class they knew they were the richest most privileged people in the society and they understood that came with responsibilities as well as\nCurrent ruling class Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg and the\nTwitter guys and you know Travis over ... I mean these are kids who have a billion dollars or several addressing T shirt and act as if they're just like you and me they were used to shoulder the responsibilities that come with the power they wield and that's part of the problem\nWhy would they do differently if they were responsible\nFor the first thing he would do if you're an employer\nIf you're running a large corporation is think about the welfare of your own employees so it's always a tell them this is universal on the Web on people start talking about abstract\nIdeas rather than concrete solutions in other words if I run Hoover for example I've got one of the largest workforces in the world I think the second largest workforce in the world so before I started lecturing you about climate change\nOr black lives matter I Would the first thing I Would do is make certain that every one of my employees was treated as well as I could possibly create them I Would I don't know give them health insurance or pay a minimum wage I Would do those things because they're my employees and like my own children I'm responsible for them to some extent I Believe that\nIn earlier generations of leaders believe that they were motivated by in part the guilt they fill their religious convictions they felt they had a duty to other people are currently leaders for example it Hoover don't even claimed them as employees were drivers don't have health insurance or they're not super employees they're contractors that part of the gig economy\nAnd so we're letting the most powerful off the hook\nFor their obligations to their fellow man and at the same time we're allowing them to lecture the rest of us as if there are moral superiors it's a very odd arrangements for travelers from looper is totally confident who's a much better person than you even as one third of Hoover drivers will lose money driving Hoover so how does that work exactly I'm baffled\nI'm speaking with Tucker Carlson of Fox News his book just out to ship a fool's the subtitle is how selfish ruling class just bringing America to the brink of revolution [noise]\nThis is not at all the criticism it is only a an observation and I'm like you to react to it your critique is a critique that would would resume one hundred percent with folks on the left is that fair to say\nNot anymore my critique is one that would have been common among liberals in Nineteen Seventy hot\nThey didn't do that and I think the smart ones are credit now\nThe smart ones are what are they regret it now\nOh really no one one leaves you didn't want me to think that\nProbably ... I mean you look around Washington and you know most conservatives in DC work at nonprofit think tanks and a lot of really great people and nice people who work at each tax but they've consumed billions of dollars in contributions over the past four years in America has not become more conservative\nAnd the smart ones are asking where did we go wrong and it's not that they're not\nSmart or they didn't try hard or they didn't have the best intentions they get it the best intentions but they were focused on the wrong thing\nWhat's he should care about is the way people live their family is the very center it's fleet Adam in marriage the court building block of everything and when that collapses there's no hope of doing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel funny asking you this but I it's it's truly meant out of curiosity 'cause I Do respect you where do you stand on President Trump\nI think that um well I mean just as an overview I agree with you know the majority scarlet the Wyoming majority of what Trump says\nUm I think Tom's genius I think you need to understand some credit for Trump's genius is not in affecting policy change I don't think he\nHas control over the executive branch's portion of government I don't think he understands how it works I don't think he's going to learn [noise] I don't think he's good at getting his program through Congress adults in Congress wants to get his program it's a lot so on that level Trump is a frustrating president to watch\nI think that Trump's value ingenious is in raising the question that no one else was willing to raise even think about as a kind of\nClarity very simple clear he so he will say things like well wait a second you know we had NATO which was this great force for forty years but it existed in order to keep the Soviets were invading Western Europe Cillizza longer exists so why do we still have NATO\nOh I don't know what the answer is that's a totally fair question and one that we all should have been asking for Nineteen Ninety One when the Soviet Union collapsed or why we got Afghanistan seven teen years later or why are we allowing the south Koreans cheat in this trade deal or why don't we build the wall like what's the answer speak slowly so I can understand\nThat's his genius being brave enough and clear enough to raise the core questions that we ought to be debating long after Scott and those questions will hang in the air when my hope is that someone will answer them and solve those problems but first you need to [noise]\nYou need to define what the problems are and I think the Trump has been really good at that\nOh I had a final question because I Know I Know your time is limited so\nYou have on guests who I find ah intellectually morally intolerable which is which is fine [laughter] okay so I just want to know where you see their name as listed on your program notes this is who will have on\nDo you think oh my God I Can't believe this or I dread this or you know what this is what I Do for a living and what the hell\nWhy put their names on that list so I'm I'm responsible for that and I just filed like literally a minute before I got on the show our story outline for tonight's show and so I'm involved there no surprises me 'cause I'm involved in the beginning to the end\nBy the purpose in doing that is\nGrows out of my belief that you need to hear the whole argument yes and you do that the regime that yeah I Try All right\nTucker bless you great to be with you and folks his ship a fool's suffered
