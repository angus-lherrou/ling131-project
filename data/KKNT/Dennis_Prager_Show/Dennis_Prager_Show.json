R. at AOL dot com [noise]\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis prayer for as I did for Larry Elder last friday [laughter]\nIt was already can continue to talk about some of the things we've been talking about the last few hours but I said I wanted to talk to about illegal immigration especially with the caravan approaching I've talked about illegal immigration\nFor over Twenty years now and I've never wavered in my position the issue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge of the simple fact\nThat people who cross the border illegally have come here legally as one caller pointed out which one of those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone the illegal aliens so you have to term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as famous place them somewhere or lost them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal then they're not allowed to be here and a story\nIf you own a home and if someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walks into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they would be asked to prove that it is Eric out if they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents to prove that the banks would not permit them access\nWhich is why so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented\nAs if they are entitled to your house and bank account if only they could find a misplaced documents\nFor years now I've said that the left has won the argument over language whether it's undocumented versus illegal livable wage versus minimum wage global warming or climate change or whatever it is the moment\nBut the left is much better to finding the terms and using the language to their benefit of course and helps to have a media on your side perpetuating these false it's so so those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they're explaining the obvious\nAnd the most recent case being parents with children\nTrying to get asylum if that's really the case if they're not just coming in for the benefits of work and President Trump and Republicans accused you heard President Obama last hour we had the clip of him of ripping children from the mother's arms and putting these children in cold cages\nNever mind that this was started under the Obama administration [noise]\nHe has more I mean but would be the right word than anybody I Know President Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue no one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes but the left the Democrats in the media all from the same thing I Do not believe in sovereignty but rather they believed in open borders but they don't like to admit it because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms never mind that want anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail they'll their children do not go with them to jail they're also then so to speak torn away from them\nAnd it all in the latest reincarnation of this conflict hundreds of Hondurans another legals are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nDallas no doubt in my my name is Thirteen and other people who do us harm or among them so again President Trump to Republicans will be on the defense of just because they want to defend our borders and the media no doubt about it will again show you crying children and distraught mothers\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right as I said to decide who gets into our country or a house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right to protect the American people from armed with a from terrorism or as one caller mentioned last hour disease or even for that matter to make sure that people who come here is a radical concept share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south of Mexico\nSome of us exist as so obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense I mention it last hour the Democrats won more votes and the country club Republicans want cheap labor of course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party I Know it\nSo you have people like George W. Bush remember this and Karl Rove saying things like Bush got up to forty percent of Hispanics old when he ran in Texas wonderful\nI'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nA loss in politics or sixty to forty percent is huge and that's based on optimistic assumption most of the ... illegal immigrants coming for jobs as we'd long established but they also take advantage of government handouts that the rest of us are paying for and the Republican Party can never out to the Democrats in offering better give it up\nSo here's a phrase I've used over the years if ever given a choice between Democrats and Democrats they always choose the real thing\nWho are these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even even on a purely selfish basis for those in the conservative side it is clear that we need to control the border but how about fairness for everybody [noise]\nWhat do you say to people around the world who've been waiting many years to get here but I have to undergo long waits and in ... and she bought a national paperwork even have a chance of getting here so they have to follow the rules but those are dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools one call a lot of different radio network when I was on a week or so ago suggests that border walls don't work in the long run\nBut even if that were true I told him I bet they work in the short run to stop mass of people coming here don't you wish we had a border now as we will are going to be confronted with these people in short time not to mention these really live safe for murder by their fence\nWe need we need to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming into our country and I don't mean with a comprehensive immigration plan that has been signed onto barrel publications like Bush George W. Bush for Paul Ryan\nNo amnesty and no pathway to citizenship should be accepted that rewards illegal behavior but today to those who say the border wall well work\nThey use the same are addicted logic I mentioned this that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent Americans use and I had at the end of last summer when they say the documents commit oh he said the caller a chance for me to have they committed mass murder no it's not like the argument or have they commit fewer crimes percentage wise the Native Americans\nWho cares even if that is true\nIf an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt your fat illegal had been denied entry in the first place no matter what the percentage and that wall preventing one Hamas murderer in Israel for mentoring would have said that Israelis life\nThe logic of these arguments is baffling unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms for example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities where criminal illegals are given safe harbor\nYou come up with phony arguments like illegals will not cooperating with the authorities you've heard this if they know they can be apprehended are sent home\nBut how about not allowing them to come in the first place and then we wouldn't care if they cooperated with the Saudis how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes than native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate to the evil police officers in ice who had the audacity to arrest people who commit crimes some of the rest of us have to live with long waists of hospitals deteriorating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities\nSo what's my solution I said I Would give it to you take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you force strict penalties against businesses which one of you mentioned that hire illegals even sending some see CEOs to jail\nAnd you would be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney had it right but he used the wrong language there we go again when he said self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remain I'd be willing to have a conversation with because they would stay for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake please enough of the government sending out the wrong message with bilingual education classes or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by its language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our values\nWell the reality is is that work on the air for jobs\nIn order to find a job\nThey gotta fill out an informant and when they do that and say they are here legally that commit perjury which is a felony or the other thing is is that they routinely make up Social Security numbers or single somewhat the Social Security numbers are set up for Immigration Studies suggest that\nAbout Seventy five percent of the illegal aliens that are here to work [noise] uh had been violating these laws\nBut nobody ever mentions it or not otherwise law abiding it's simply a myth my daughter was actually a victim of a\n... by illegal aliens using her Social Security number which were stolen which was a child [laughter] so uh I don't know why the conservatives Republicans don't push back on this whole illegal thing\nA by by describing what's happening here is entirely when people come here to work [noise]\nYeah just a one one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me\nThere's got to be an orderly procedure that house someone gets into a country we call the legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to the people you want to give the opportunity to [noise]\nHe seems so obvious to me and that's why you have to have the when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been a terrific a boost to the United states of Murphy illegal immigrants but you changed language let's go to Rick in the Bronx Rick you're on was mark\nUp actually taking my call mark I think it's one thing that's changed a big lost all I mean if you're like this caravan of course they want they want they either\nPathway contented only ... the out a solid dog Guatemala decent people what's lost in those countries that pose country just gangs and and search team or what you want to tell\nYou all know the real point is I thought you were getting too they aren't all good people that that they're going to be terrorists among them the going to be people that don't value the ideal so we do in the United states of America forgive me even people with disease right they haven't been said and as one caller pointed out so you have\nTo have some means of doing this some orderly process that's the whole point\nHis argument seems such such an easy one to win if you frame it in the right terms use the right language you know be compassionate people okay you want to come to this country I think we let a million people in a year\nThere's a way to do it here the rules here the procedures you have to follow them ... President Trump's Republicans are going to lose this one either way right do you call out the national guard or whatever you do you stop them from coming in what you got to do your evil bad guys as Obama said ripping children away from their mothers and everybody joins in with that trait\nAnd if you uh do stop them you have an invasion you have people coming into these people aren't coming in for some that maybe some of them\nBut a lot of them we know they're ...

helpful to grow up and down\nOn people and frankly among among the press says well\nOkay I I think he's entirely right the one thing that I Would be careful of Mr Weiss respectfully don't compare Louis Farrakhan the Donald Trump I mean those are gone is an open unapologetic lifelong anti Semite\nHe is that meaning he he clearly is he doesn't even apologize for it anymore and uh he he is identified I don't know anyone\nWho can plausibly say that Louis Farrakhan is not a hater of Jewish people\nAnd Donald Trump is so free of that charge you can charge Trump with lots and lots of stuff but I I tweeted about this it is unequivocal that Donald Trump cares deeply about the state of Israel\nAnd as Sarah Huckabee Sanders said today he adores his Jewish grandchildren\nAnd the idea that the Donald Trump is quote dog whistling or is is some kind of deep anti Semite or that he's responsible for encouraging things like this synagogue attack by as little wife said a guy who said he hated

together and we've seen him do exactly that\nHowever the president is going to continue to draw a contrast a particularly as we go into the final days of an election the differences between the two parties particularly on policy differences you'll continue to see him make that contrast Bob but he had certainly I think\nFound those moments to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us can condemn as well\n[noise] okay and again I it it is hard for me to imagine that Sarah could have handled these these\nQuestions more effectively than she did Jonathan Karl kept a going at this and about President Trump blaming the media which by the way yeah do I believe he should pull back on that of course it's\nTired it's stupid stop it um but Jonathan Karl put the question of Sarah why is the author\nWe say for you for your wife the author very very first\nThing that the president didn't was condemned the attack soaked in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous [laughter]\nAccent is outrageous that that would be the very first reaction so many people across the country I'm\nNot finished the only person responsible for carrying out either of these heinous acts were the individuals who carry them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders fault for the individual who shot up a baseball field of congressional Republicans you can't start putting the responsibility of individuals on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime was\nSupposed to be interesting if the news media pushes the one policing claim here you know the\nPrintout placing blame the president's not it's not responsible for these acts\nBecause again the very first actually let the president did was condemn these heinous acts the very first thing that the media did was condemned the president and go after and try to place blame not just on the president's\nBut everybody that works in this administration the major news networks first public statement what's to blame the president and myself included I mean that is outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carried out the crime would hold that responsibility\nOkay and ... and again particularly regarding the synagogue in in Pittsburgh

double checking\nOkay now the volt meter that you have when you're cruising down the road and everything is okay is it pretty close to Thirteen eight to fourteen to is that either for the light in\nThe air conditioning on it goes for Thirteen and fourteen to hell\nBecause that's perfect and when you're cranking it should never drop below nine and a half or ten they'll say that's a good battery so you can always watch that these are numbers that we all use its not numbers I'm making up every shop in town uses these numbers but now when it what's the lowest you've seen the voltage\nTwelve\nOkay and that's just what we call static battery\nNow ... uh twelve point one is ten percent charge to twelve point force forty percent charge the twelve point eight is eighty percent charging thirteenth full so if you're down to twelve votes you're you're just cold cooling costs static so you're not charging anything at all at twelve votes\nYes yeah so I guess the alternate or I'd like to hear from you if the alternate does two things if it straightened up your ... gauge and gets rid of the noise that would that important to me\nNow is the second part of the question when I replaced your state or is it just the alternate early on everything on the back and then just run it through if there's no other thing when they're strictly shale cater\nKnow their their regulators going to be inside the Alternator bought it and Albert brushes and the ... trio and stuff but I Want you to pull the negative cable and then you have this disconnect a battery so I I don't want you to have power 'cause\nYou know the other day one of my guys was wrenching on the back of an alternate Ernie hadn't disconnected the battery and some of his ranch reaches over and hits the ground and there's a whole lot of sparks in wipes out the diodes on the air so I got to buy another one okay\nThank you betcha you betcha Darryl Europe next um how can I help you out\nAnd mark a great show hey I can make it quick I've got two thousand seven Toyota Tacoma it's a V. six automatic four wheel drive and I'm I'm retired so I'm trying to do\nSome neglected maintenance and I've done a lot of ... says what have you but I'm trying to service the automatic transmission and boy it's it's an ordeal and I I think you've talked about this before on line but maybe I'm wrong there is not a traditional drain\nAnd shell procedure like you would see on Ninety five percent of the cars there is a dry and blood on the bottom and the adjacent to the transfer case down low on the translation there is a lot of ...\nI got an a serviceman you all you can drop a band that plays the filter only a couple of course of oil come out\nAnd then it tells you to bring it up to operate and capture and it tells you use a scandal and it'll tell you ... and then you can drink more ... is there a better way or am I missing something totally here with these translations\nSo ... how are you going to head flew to the ...\nWell no they they tell you to help it into the site and that there's a silk port and if you download by the transmission\nGod so then they tell you it has to be operating temperature for everything to cycle more fluid than what is contained in the past\nI've had some on some of the forms they said they go to these places they hook it up to your transmission cooler lines near the front of the uh\nUh rated out of the bottom and then a cyclist up through and supposedly they got a machine that can claim a refresher fluids I thought I've never experienced that before\nOkay um well here's here's the problem that you're going to have the problem is is um has never had the filter changed by pulling the pan do we know there's a filter underneath depend is that what your service manual says\nYeah yeah I did it when I bought the truck and again it was all upset at that time was just ... and it really is not even a they call the shelter but it really just looks like a grain that's why it is that I shouldn't say wide open it's not a traditional shelter like God of automatic translation okay yeah now I ... it looks\nRight All right so when we did that it go ahead I'm Sorry\nIt's okay when we hook up the slush machine or just shove anew and an ... year old out so we have to clear hoses so that the one that's going into your transmission is going to be read nice and cherry red fluid and the stuff that's coming out is going to be different\nSo we're just flush it's until it's clean\nThen we're going to use that that over Phil whole when we're all done and while we're doing the slush we're not going to rejuvenate your flu and you're going to pay for all the flute we're putting in and that's it right in a court system and we use twelve to get it to what Rand claim then you pay twelve\nBut we're also going to have somebody inside the car going from park to reverse the neutral to drive to low in the back and forth we are going to cycle the all the fluids through all the valves body in through the converter\nAnd so I usually I tell people just do the filter screen first and then from that point on depending on how dirty it is at that point we're just going to move forward and we're just going to do a flush about every Seventy five or eighty thousand miles\nNephew has earned her daddy or you can go to a hundred but um it it might be all of us are real familiar with with what we need to do often times there's going to be some like you said a scanner that's going to tell us that we know we're we're okay on the on the fluid liberal you wouldn't have that\nBut there's other ways you're going to find on the Internet that people there's a Phil hole and chances are that there's going to be some kind of we don't want it coming out of the ... we want you to hit the bottom of the ... whole that's that's yeah they're common\nYeah there's an overflow indicator on the transmission so they're they tell you to be careful and\nThis is where your drain it and ... indicator okay and that's what they recommend so okay so just to it sounds like I could do to filter it get it written topped off with at least as much as I said just measure what you took out and put that back in and and\nSo is there any place in Prescott I live up in Prescott any place you recommend\nNo um I I'm embarrassed to tell you I've tried to find somebody in Prescott and I can't I Would like to spread out my wings but if you come down the Seventeen there's Tom and deer valley and I Seventeen northwest corner and then at bell Seventeen is Kurtz on the northeast corner and both of those guys are\nOf qualified and well season and both of them have gray hair and both of them are master technicians they they know how to handle your your Toyota now\nOkay my daughter is ... ... ... or someplace closer\nI mean you can go to a automotive dynamics on grand in Ninety ninth avenue or you can go to ... eighty eighth avenue and tea Berg guy so those guys are in that particular area as well and you're going to you before you leave your going to ask them and they're going to give you a range because they don't know\nHow long it's going to take and how much fluid it's gonna take but you're on of transmission flush you're going to be in the two to three hundred dollar ... and ... and especially if it's got synthetic fluid and race and so it just depends on whether whether what it calls for and if it takes just regular decks drawn or ATF no easy what yeah\nTaking type yeah so yeah so I asked some funky fluid always seemed like I can only every part of it you\nKnow [laughter] that that's what they want you to believe the fact of the matter is is if Toyota used to say you had to use Toyota filters eureka it used to say you have to use our vacuum bags there's a ... as it's a\nIt's a federal law it's called the Magnuson moss act and it says if you must use the proprietary\nWhatever on your ... you have to provide it for free\nAnd ... ... max life is something I Would probably look at and ... life has the charts and if you can file your toilet in there then it's certified that fact that balance max life will fit in your Toyota and frankly that's probably what we'd put in it yeah\nAlready okay thank you betcha speaking of transmission is automatic translation exchanges on forty a street and Washington he's been around since Nineteen sixty eight Phil and his staff are really good guys with respect to transfer missions\nThey know how to fix transformations and they're kind of guys that will drive if you can duplicate the problem then they'll go with you but they're not going to let you drive to lake pleasant and back that's not going to happen but you get the problem or you point out\nThat the leak is right here below the rearview mirror right and in the middle of the car that's the kind of tough customer that saves a lot of diagnostic process\nThat feels been around a long time he's capable of small lakes transmission services and all the way to the overalls and he was around with transportation automatic shore first there as a result of that\nHe's very skilled on the newer modeled transmission is because all we're doing is using the electronic sewn to redirect fluid and pressure or before we used manual vows to do it so the transmission is still the same we're just shift in your car electronically so forty street and Washington the north side of the road\nSix oh two five await zero nine sixty six oh two five await zero nine sixty Jeff I'm going to get your question ... probably take you on the other side of the break but go right ahead\nYeah I got to the older models a Chevy ... dropped the three eighty three stroke or create motor it and I didn't know it will change and I put a five to thirty for me it was just tend to be thirty to conserve\nNo no and it and let me just explain real quick I Want you to put the palms of your hands together and this is new technology we're putting zero twenty some cars today so you put your hands to get them you you you fly them real fast and you can create the heat in between the palms of your hands you rubber I'm real fast now I asked you\nThe main thing that day ... burning down thanks sitting around here right right make a sharp right turn gets announced it sounds trite fire right\nWell it's it's not really a ... flush on a differential it's a drain and refill soon we're going to actually drain and refill your transmission and that the easiest part of that is is just simply what kind of car truck\nWe talking about a it's an AA Shadi blazer okay so it's going to have a cover on the back of it so we are going to take the cover off\nAnd all the fluids gonna dump out it's going to give us a chance to look at the the pattern on the teeth of the ring and pinion it's also good when you give us a really good idea of if it shut and metal and normal differential shed metal it's the amount of metal that's the season guys know what to do\nThat then we're going to put a new gasket both up to cover them there's a hole in the side and we're going to fill it with gear loop until it starts to come out and then we're going to stop how many miles on your car or truck\nHuh I'm getting plenty\nOkay have you and you've never done a differential service\nNow for Twenty years and I haven't done anything like that\nOkay well if I were you either have it done and you can call around and just tell them I've got a rear wheel drive GM\nAnd um I I ... you know what what will cause for a differential service and and I assume that you're going to pull the cover off the back and then now some guys are going to stick a straw in the ... hole and suck all the fluid out\nThat's okay that's going to be cheaper and they'll look at the fluid and say you know it looks good or looks worn or looks really bad\nI think it's a better idea to pull the cover off of it so I can look inside I Want to see how the teeth are mission and I want to look how much metal that shit based on that you've been around the world for times\nSo I'm more happy doing it that way but if you want me to do just what we call a sucking fail then yeah just stick a straw down in their turn on the machine suck out all the fluid put it in and now you're probably in the vicinity of Seventy five to eighty five dollars I'm guessing\nSo that you got those two choices\nI Would think you would do the first you'd you'd take the cover up so you could see everything and then maybe if everything was okay then the next time you did a service which is going to be another eighty to a hundred thousand miles maybe at that point you pull the cover off or you can do a straw sucking fill because you've already done the covered the first time so those are your options okay\n... thanks okay\nUh-huh Bye bye and the service differential I'd take notes on all you guys Wayne you're up next how can I help you\nNeed your help Mark I'm good at two thousand and one could MR two inch Christine got sixty thousand miles on it the engine light when I took it to the guy that is a certified of\nLike this guy and I'm sure we get to replace the canisters I I don't know what that is but okay oh that's a net six hundred and Seventy five dollars a\nWeek later the light comes on again so I bring it back and\nLook at it diagnostic equipment by the way so he comes back and he says it's the now my mind as an old guy it's what you call it ... it's a way that you can open in ... what is it\n... what is that as you're\nTalking about ... el ... you guys have been mentioning it all day and stuff anyway bottom line is\nThat tree place so now we're closing in an eight hundred and then [noise]\nI'm saying you know what Arizona law says I can take my car in within Ninety Days of the late ... coming due and I can do and I can get inspection done\nSo I'm driving to the inspection I Am half a mile away and the lights come again okay\nI'm going to take it back but Mike ... you know what I'm concerned about is this\nAnd there's no great answer for a while I'm going to ask you but I get your opinion do I take it back to the guy that has worked in my car for four years who is certified\nToy you know a Lexus do I go to some other guy who's going to start over and do the diagnostics again and charge me a hell of a lot more money [noise] um\nWhat do you think I should do\nI Can't believe for the life of me why\n... years so kind about this I Can't believe that you let him guess twice clearly but most of them were gases if that guy worked for me he'd be put on probation\nAnd and then you talk about him being Toyota certified which gives him God like the skills\nWell he's not exhibiting his God like skills there's no question about that\nFor whatever reason he's struggling he probably doesn't have an and everybody's got a scanner but do you have a smoke machine and do you know what the smokes machine does and you know how to use it and what kind of information as you get any\nAre you pulling vacuum on the fuel tank or is the sensor that's supposed to tell the computer icy vacuum is that center bad\nSo you have to determine which one it is so we're going to suck the fumes off the tank and burn him through the engine but in order for the computer to know that the valve is open then there's a sensor that says oh I see no I don't see pressure any more I see that Kim and I'm simplify and everything to make my point that\nUm [laughter] I have a code every time or we don't know\nWell you know what it was kinda crazy I still went to the emissions place they said well maybe there's something stupid that\nImportant it failed\nWell in it but the code is kind of meaningless is what I've been told like it's it's a generic code they could do with thousands of thing so what I'm Wondering guys bottom line not to take up all of your your time is it is I'm surprised where do I take a car\nAnd him or to not not a Chevy Ford did it\nOr not but I Know it off\nYour car using jet fears that uses cranks have censors it uses gasoline it uses air in mass has mass Airflow center has spark plugs just like the cheapest ... in the whole wide world so it's it's fundamentals it's fun\nIf you go someplace else you're gonna have to go back to him and you have to say I'm eight hundred dollars down buddy this guy and I've got thirty days behind it and he suspects that here's his old part now I bet you didn't ask for the old ...\nOf course I wouldn't know what I Do think\nOkay well if you did you could go back to him and say ... I've got thirty days he fix that here's his repair order with all due respect clearly you didn't so here at my old canister and here's mild whatever else I'd like you to put those back on and I would like to you to give me a credit\nBut I Want to tell you something I if that guy that guy clearly hasn't doesn't have the skills or the talent that you think he does and he doesn't have the skills and the talent that I Know he should have in order to be doing this job\nAnd so I'm not going to put him on that presidential well that's a bad word in this climate today I'm not going to put him in that God Bless the positions of knowing you know all about Toyota's because clearly he doesn't\nNow so he could have easily fixture car then go drive it and watch what's going on\nHe could clearly see if the monitor reset and it's you can't do you can't turn off your ... you can't have a light\nThan what you do is you disconnect a battery and you think you're going to sail through emissions that is not going to happen because in the middle of we fixed it to the middle of emission test is available it's called the monitor and the computer wants to see the engine go through a series of stop go fast or slow left turn right turn on how many times we started it's called\nA sheet cycles how many times we get hot how many times does it get cold\nSo there's no fooling the emissions anymore\nSo you have to be able to have the monitor reset which shows success and then you go through emissions in his case the light came on and the the monitor never reset so he never kicked this problems but ever\nSo I Would if you're going to go up north um if if you give me a where are you at again\nIf if let's say simply fail and grand\nOkay I'd go to Senator Byrd auto eighty eighth avenue in Thunderbird\nUnder auto yeah and I called Sunday or bird auto yeah\nEighty eighty eighth avenue in Thunderbird I'd go him and tell Tom Marc Salem says he doesn't have a chance in hell if he's going to be able to fix your andme are too and watched the veins in his met pop\nSo ... and tell him I've taken it to a Toyota expert this is called waving the flag in front of the bowl okay I get to an\nExpert in a Toyota guy and he replaced a canister and he replace that and here's his two bills so Marc Salem says you're not going to be able to fix this but I thought I'd give you a try\nTen of his our in our veins aren't popping out of his back by the time you're done [laughter] I Know what's gonna happen he has myself what he's going to call me two minutes later to go and he's going to use bad words but that's okay he's the best guy in your area to pull this off\nOkay that sounds like it's way too tired it's now how many shares did you put in\nI I got at least four maybe five sham in there\nOK than than than we have to and is this problem existed ever since you put this in\n... before okay that are starting to go out about three or four years ago and I just got to use one friend of mine and did the same thing and it worked for about a year and the housing crash okay well uh they're starting to that I Am\nA about a year ago at the same thing happen is it that it had a crack in the house yeah\nOkay well what part of the time do you live and\nI'm at forty third avenue and\nOkay um have you got a pencil handy yeah OK\nOkay I'm going to give you the name of a bunch of guys that can help you with a guy but they're going to have to see the vehicle um you can go to ... auto at thirtieth avenue and Indian school Bob's an old race car guy\nHe'll help you I Know he can fix it I Know Billie at twenty fifth street automotive twenty fifth street on a motivational drag racer I Know he can fix it\nIf you want to go north than Tom black well he's a good friend of mine he's Henri as all get out um\nAnd but he could face [laughter] so ... those are the guys that could pull this off it it it really has to do with blowing up the teeth and and matching the teeth to the flywheel to the teeth to the starter by chance you know what the starter number you're using his\nOh gosh I forget it it's like a thirty thirty six sixty or something like that thirty six ten maybe maybe it's thirty six ten okay I don't remember\nAll right well you ... what you said yeah the three eighty three but that's still a small black Chevy that's just been poked right\nNo no it's only at three fifty oh okay well then it's only had three ... and it's a it's a block mount shorter than the other\nYes mount starter okay yeah\nSo I I Would take it over there and and or you can go to fill it automatic transmission exchange forty street in Washington ... ... ... all those guys know what to do and and what you're describing is is the fact that it's it's gnashing of teeth when you go to fire it\nAnd it won't release the teeth and now you have to wear 'em the teeth\nIt's either got the wrong started the wrong flywheel or we need to re sham something we need to take some shims out but see it it doesn't make sense to me because if you got a bunch of ... in there and you're still clashes teeth it's probably not a sham issue\nSo in that particular case then I Would be going with you uh fly wheeler starter but I think it's five ten is your starter I could be wrong but I'm just trying to work off memory and the world with that number thirty five ten\nThirty five to thirty six ten\nOh thirty six ten I'm Sorry I'm thirty six ten thirty so I think if you look at if you look at the park spoke and you go to the parts store\nEverything every small black Chevy all through the seventies and probably the eighties the thirty six ten was the story is just the starter for the small black Chevy during that time frame sorry rice\nWould they charge me for this\nI have not been out here I have no idea it's ... they're going to tell you you know it's this much it's going to be between this and this they're all going to give the rangers but I got to run because I got ten seconds to go but with those guys could fix this up six oh two five away zero nine sixty we got Bob next and we'll be back right after this\n[noise] did you know rein treat auto repair spring number one in the

therefore he doesn't have to spend all the staff and all the time\nTo ensure that they're not selling unnecessary parts or repairs so if you're looking for a great shopping in Sun City area may I recommend automotive dynamics on the north side of grand just west of Ninety ninth avenue Bob Europe next I'm Sorry it took so long to get to you but I you're got the floor\nOkay thanks so much hey I've got an a two thousand Fifteen jeep Cherokee latitude in two months ago and I gave in to my wife and decided to turn on the navigation system okay\n[noise] um it works pretty good for about a month and then a mother and a half an hour away from Iowa to hear\nIt cramped out to the point where it thinks it's in in Des Moines Iowa and ... and the compass keeps on going around in circles I called up a the the customer service and they said ... drive in a circle a ten times it's counter clockwise and that took care of the problem\nWell it didn't you go to the ideas\nYeah I Want you to follow the procedure exactly like the manual says and there's going to be a a procedure in your manual that's going to tell you how to reach center of the the compass in five north\nAnd typically they're right but there's a lot more to it than just going out there and doing circles and hoping some policemen doesn't stop you for being looking like you're an idiot but I Know that all of our cars have that same thing now if you do exactly what the manual says if you just go into the area of the compass\nHe's saying one sixty eight so see what happens let's go to the phones Jim I'm I've got you what can I Do for you\nGood morning mark demonic a last spring I decided to put my two thousand eight Subaru Outback and storage and the battery was nicely charge so hooked up a a folk charge into it and er\nDuring the summer I checked it periodically I'd open the car door and the interior lights went on a knife and bright and I figured that was a good sign but last week I uh\nDisconnected the folk charger gotten the car but the key and the mission during the gay and bam a battery exploded what would cause that\nWell there's this park somewhere either inside and and let me ask you this so people understand that's probably the loudest explosion you've ever been to Jason too isn't it\nIt's a good thing I was wearing my depends\n[laughter] you ...\nI got to tell you there's been times in my shop where we've created a spark on top of a battery that gassing\nAnd the explosion feels like a semi just hit the main part of the building is eighty miles an hour if it is now I Hope you got the hose out immediately and washed everything down as fast as you could give okay I guess\nI'd say you had to spark heat inside the battery or outside of the battery let me put some holes in what you're thinking that that trickle charger was right didn't blow the cap softer to blow the whole top of the battery off\nA it was a failed battery blue uh what were they kept them off and a blue for four holes in the battery case itself\nOkay okay [noise] more than likely the explosion occurred within so it's the ... because of the explosion in the battery but there's no guarantee of that we have a spark either on top of the battery or ... inside the battery that's all there is to it\nThe fact of life came on doesn't mean anything because the light needs half and amp\nAnd you know the battery at eight at eight votes nine volts ten votes can pop the light on and so that's not it when you hit the key you said to this battery give me all you got and when it charged up to give you all got it blew up so I think what you do is go back with a good battery\nPut it in there and then this is what I Want you to try\nI I Want you to plug in your your battery maintenance device and um I Want you to let it sit for three or four days I Want you to do you have a ... meter by chance yeah okay good go hit the terminals and under the best of conditions you're going to be pretty close to Thirteen votes okay\nThen I Want you to take off your battery tender and let it sit for a couple of days and you better have pretty close to the same voltage\nNow if it was a see if my number one battery was the seals batteries and you're not allowed to put water in it but a spark underwater is not a spark\nSo sometimes what happens is is even though they say sealed you can tip 'em sideways and you can see the water level is well below the plate so then we just don't screw those stupid calf pulled a label off the top on screw the cap and puts them distilled water or just regular water in it\nSo like I said a spark underwater is not a spark so it could have easily been something that caused it to drop in in voltage are dropping and\nIf you overcharge if it's going to consume a electrolytes and so that's when you start dropping down below the plates and the plate spark and that blows up the other thing I Want you to do is is when it's run and I don't want to see anything more than four fourteen point five\nSo when you started up member were doing these voltage desk we hold the idol up high or\nHave your wife hold the I looked kind of high and I don't want to say anything more than fourteen five and if he sees something in the Fifteen range than you have a problem with the alternate or in regulator and were oil in the water out of the battery that's what's happening okay\nIf ... is it possible to float charger was defective and it over to charge the battery\nIt's not likely and and let me change your question mark have you ever seen a tender go crazy and they have ... no I've seen them work\nAnd not work and and trust me I have\nI put the ranch I probably have for tenders running on a bunch of my farm equipment my excavators and my tractors and my Bob cats in my high lift and stuff like that so I have never had any problems in the last ten years with four or five and then I have a tender on my polaris and my Honda Claude\nThat I used to go round up horses sometimes\nSo I've never seen a bad tender never\nHave seen him bad when they quit working but I've never seen one overcharge anything\nSo for some reason the electrolytes level went down\nYeah it it could have been at the very beginning or but that's why I Want you to check the battery ... after a couple of days I Want you to check the battery 'cause if it's up there north of fourteenth five than the tender is bad\nI I don't want it to charge more than fourteen five and then we'll take it off it's going to be about fourteen and that's those are the two numbers I Want to see\nAll I've already put a new battery in it and everything is working fine in fact ah I I Will check though again I Want to make I don't want to use them I don't want to use the flow charger again without testing it tells you guys have asked me to soak\nIn and let me change let me change my numbers I I'm wrong I Want you to write down this Thirteen five and Thirteen I don't know where I got the fourteenth five but when we charge battery we we might go up to fourteen votes man we might go up to ... high idle Alternator running wide open so that was\n... I was under the impression that it float charger maintained the voltage it which was when it was hooked up and it wouldn't take it above that that home out of it started charger it just to maintain or\nI I understand but we need to maintain and the Thirteen votes okay that's fully charged so we didn't know that for years and years and years but like I said everybody agrees today twelve point one is ten percent twelve point five is fifty percent and Thirteen is one hundred percent\nSo it's not uncommon for me to hook up a battery that has twelve point two votes in it\nAnd go back and I'm going to use it so I'll stick with my vote meter and it has Thirteen with the tender off of it so I brought it up from a low twelve to Thirteen I'm pretty happy about that so it's not going to maintain that because if you plug it in its twelve one maintaining twelve one is not a good idea\nOkay all righty thank you for the education\nOkay Jim thanks very much had a lot of good information and as as with most of us guys um we we we know how to say yes and no but few of us know how to say I don't know [laughter]\nI mean I Know have the I don't know comes from the ladies at the front counter of the auto repair shop because you asked them a question in the end at the appropriate time they say I don't know\nBut you can interview a hundred guys at the front counter and uh and especially if you ask him a question about what's compression ratio on your car they'll throw something that [laughter] but it and I make fun of the difference between men and women because in my industry there is a significant difference\nWhen we talk about men and women women will make the noise in the lobby full of people and guys won't guys will describe the noise but most of the time the noise is different to them than it is to us\nSo vibrations are different the women will will ask them questions does a shake deceive your pants shake the steering wheel does a shake the passenger side front seat\nThere is specific reasons we ask that\nIf it shakes just this during will the vibrations in the front end of the car if it shakes just your but then the vibrations in the back of the car if it shakes the seat next to the driver and the steering wheel than we got a vibration throughout the car\nSo that helps us diagnosis so the few minutes you spend at the front counter with questions and answers then and then that's really good time because it's going to save your diagnostic time\n[noise] don't let anybody sell you anything before you check the owner's manual there's a lot of um repair shop at first of all let me tell you that the repairs industry is suffering because in the last three four or five years the cars that came out before before this problem\nEverybody had to thirty a sixty and Ninety maintenance stop virtually every car and truck out there had a slew of stuff that needed to be done at thirty six ten Ninety\nToday it's all gone to Seventy five two hundred\nWe have very few stops we might have a few filters stop between zero and an eighty or Ninety thousand miles\nSo we've lost all of this maintenance because the car comes with synthetic transformation fluids synthetic differential flip synthetic engine oil it's got spark plugs that go a hundred and ten thousand miles the battery will go the alternate or some more sophisticated we have all this going on\nSo you can imagine if you are like man you owned an auto repair shop and you saw sales falling\nYou might decide that you want to start selling people something that you know that doesn't fit within the parameters of their owner's manual it's not uncommon for people to tell me that they have a two year old car and the shops telling them they need to change their fluids in their transmission at thirty five\nAnd I asked them to look at the owner's manual and that's not what it says and then sometimes I'll hear this all here with a service either said that the owners manuals not written for Arizona\nThe labor pool changes or they change something changes and it just doesn't work so we're back to the idea of did you put enough away in savings and I would say for most people the answer's no\nI don't generally have people who say gosh I saved too much I really didn't have to do this [laughter] [laughter] so I Would agree with you on that one\nAnd there may be a few out there but uh yeah I don't think so most people instead of trying to figure out if they have enough saved away and if so will back go together with their Social Security to provide income that they need mhm\nAnd that right there is the heart and the basis of putting together a retirement income plan what do I have\nWhat do I know is coming and why do I hope is coming in and going and then going from there and and determining what income I Will start\nMy night well started what would the taxes the on doing that and how's that going to play out in the long term so I'm thinking I'll do this today but it's got to still be good for me in the eighties I recently met with someone who said why now have to think about the eighties but I'm really worried just over the next few years while\nThat's the point of it all is\nHuman we don't tend to think out a lot of years we\nTend to think in the moment and that's good because that's how we you know survive but you know these important but that only focusing on how you'll be the next few years can be short sighted in may lead to a a mistake of spending you know too much in the early years of retirement thinking that\nI'd probably want I'm not going to be one of those who lives to be Ninety\nI can stand more today so we need to understand that\nWe have to have a plan that says yes you can spend more to now when you first retired boy is that normal but how we're going to do later on and just you know tracking it out and making sure we keep track of monitoring it as we go\nA lot of people don't realize that uh their Social Security benefits may be taxed a lot of people don't realize that uh if they wait we're not taking the benefits at age sixty two that the full retirement age is has been moving up and I believe it's sixty six now right\nSixty six some for some sixty six in so many months because it's going up sixty six and two four six eight ten and then sixty seven is a sign of full retirement age\n... or you can go beyond final for retirement age Seventy and you get an extra ... percent per year\nMhm severe full retirement age of sixty six should get that eight percent per year for time if you're full retirement age of sixty seven you'll get that eight percent for three years\nIt's ... eight percent for three years ... only four percent yes\nFor the rest of your life for the rest of your life and so it's important that consideration because if you go on the other side and started sixty to\nYour benefit reduction could be as high as thirty percent so anywhere from twenty five to thirty percent for the rest of your life\nSo does it make more sense to take the benefit reduction or does it make more sense to just take what's there or something in between or to hold out and tell Seventy and get that additional enhanced amount that goes for the rest of your life\nAnd a lot of people as I said don't realize that they may end up paying tax on their Social Security benefits\nYou may we have a pretty low threshold for taxation to start on Social Security that particular programs not ever been index for inflation and so we're still looking at it at a number that was set in twenty ... twenty Thirty years ago and of course our cost of living has gone up I guess anymore I should say at least maybe thirty to forty years ago\nI Would have to sit in at that up because time just races on doesn't it\nOr we had a faster than most people realize and before you realize that you turn around and you look and you say well I'm almost ready for retirement but I didn't save enough for retirement\nAnd in the numbers that you need to be saving are really substantial now you can do a little bit of catch up on this process um and there are some ways to do catch up but let's say you just wanted a million dollar nest egg at age sixty five retirement age\nThat's a nice round number yeah I think most people would say okay a million dollars mhm a male okay with that a lot of people do I think that this is the number that they\nCome up with yes\nSo if you start at age twenty five saving for that million dollar nest egg and you're assuming a seven percent annual rate of return you're not going to get seven percent across the board but it'll be up and down and all over and maybe it'll average out to seven percent oh you only need about three hundred eighty one dollars a month\nIf you start at age twenty five you wait until age fifty five looking at five thousand seven hundred Seventy eight dollars a month and quite frankly most people don't make that kind of money to set aside that kinda money\nThat is a lot of money to be pulling out if you're a monthly income that would be very difficult for most\nOf those people are going to fall short yeah yeah but and so it's starting earlier\nIs important ketchup or milk or on\nFor one case if you're over age fifty you can\nInvest in additional six thousand on top of Eighteen five so\nYou can do a fair amount in four one K. is less and an IRA five thousand five hundred years standard and you can do an additional one thousand catch a provision on there\nYou can it's sometimes with couples I see where they can go a period of time or if each\nPerson in the couple is is working but they can each one of them put into therefore when Kaine used they catch up and that really does give them a you know put some on the fast track to being able to get their accounts bumped up to where there'll be able to create some good income in retirement that would meet their retirement neat\nAs we continue will take a look at another shaving ideas

them why smart retirement with certified financial planner Fleming\nAnd fit and clear and no\nAction which would you want to be back with a woman named for women to ensure looking at\nMistakes people make in retirement and more specifically looking at ways to avoid them we've covered a lot of territory so far Nancy\nThe H ... the long term care insurance those I think are are vital issues for many many people because they're gonna have expenses leader in retirement in ... when you first returned you're you you may be aren't even thinking about long term care issues\nYou're I don't think so you know where I Am some fun you're off work now you're off work and you've got this bucket list and you've got all these things that you've been starting to do it maybe is sort of started into them or maybe could go either way sometimes had people started a little bit\nKnowing when they retire they can blow it up some more you know do more of it and I have other people who just are like you know the horseback waiting for that weren't what they've done to go off you know and then they can just go for it and\nSo it goes either way but the biggest thing I see when we start here is if we have time we need money you know the old saying well if I hadn't I might have no money and if I had money I have no time the great balancing act of retirement is to have both\nSo how do we have enough time and how do we have enough money one mistake we sometimes see is that people don't calculate this out and they find themselves spending too much in those early years of retirement thinking while these first two years matter\nNot looking far enough down the road not visualizing themselves in their you know being eighties and the you off I ...\nAnd a half dead anyway and rock and a lot to do anything and all this stuff you know 'cause here we are sixty now and\nThat's not a healthy way to look at it and it's and it's important to it matter what age you are that you got the appropriate amount of income for your basic needs and then some lifestyle income and then obviously in case there's some type of unexpected expense one\nPlace where unexpected expenses come up all the time family\nSpecifically kids turns out who knew kids are expensive\nThey are expensive any I [laughter]\nI still marvel that if you have kids and you really love your kids it's\nOften you find yourself opening your wallet and sometime you end up opening your wallet for the rest of your life I Can't tell you how many times someone will say to me okay I have grandchildren or gosh you know what we're finally having our first grandchild in December march whatever\nAnd boy we would really like to start funding a college planned for that ... wonderful ideas yeah and it's a great idea as long as you can afford it as long as you've got your own income needs taken care of your future income needs taken care of because you know guess what\nYou can't to borrow for your retirement living\nYou can't do it you know again in this wonderful goal and quite a few people who will put in for children's um college because it's expensive\nAnd that's wonderful and the people I have can't afford it but if you just looking at it and you're saying\n... if it's an iffy kind of staying remember college you can borrow from college there's ... there's um\nThere's going to be scholarships and grants and there's ways to get money there's no scholarship for your retirement there is no grant for your retirement\nAnd so we want to make sure that your basics are in place in your foundation is in place so that when you go to jail somebody out because they lost their job or for whatever other reason we saw in two thousand eight with all the lay off\nA lot of parents helping a lot of adult children who have gotten laid off from their jobs\nYou don't really think about it that way but yeah there is no uh there is a loan to be made ... student loans being made for retirement\nUm so you you got to be careful with the kids and spending too much around the kids you got to be I'm worried about uh whether you're going to have enough savings to last throughout your retirement\nEvery now and then something comes up and you're thinking well maybe I should borrow against four one K. maybe a ... yeah but we as we said that's not a good idea\nTo not a good idea at but that doesn't mean you know people basically are I think pretty generous and people basically are really really just good hearted and really want to help when they can and um I Want to mention one area because we're in October\nAnd when you hit Seventy and a half when you have retirement accounts you start into taking\nDistributions known as required minimum distributions is is based on a chart that's put out by the IRS mhm and in addition to looking at how those will impact your tax wise\nWhen you're taking additional income and often I see that they're a requirement of distribution for someone\nIsn't even necessary for them to meet their basic income need or there's a piece of it the chunk of it not necessary for income needs and you might say well that's okay I'll pay a little extra tax but when we were looking at this there's two other factors\n... when you retire it's a fundamental change in your lifestyle ... and you just are on the opposite side of the coin so to speak\nAnd so it's also a fundamental change in your money so your taxes will be different because you've got\nUm Medicare premiums now when you're working or if you're paying personal insurance your insurance premiums aren't necessarily going to be based on how much you're earning I mean when you're at work and they pull out for insurance they don't base it on your what your pay scale is\nHelping veterans like Barry is

paralyzed veterans of America you\nKnow you're my smart retirement we're certified financial planner swimming and Sinclair no\nThanks so much for joining us talking with Nancy Fleming swimming financial services\nAnd you know here's something that can simplify life in retirement de clutter\nThere's been a lot said about that I read a book on it\nNow you got this book about declaring it was just clearing up the case\nI Do actually [laughter] but I did try to get rid of some other books I'm like you I like to keep my books I like to have a library\nThat we're seeing that becoming more and more popular particularly as people approach retirement age and they want to go ahead and just get rid of things perhaps because of downsizing or just as people get older we find them wanting to get rid of sentimental items that they have collected\nSo the question is what should I keep what should I not he I don't want to leave all the stops here for my family to have to go through when I have to move to assisted living or when I die or just near south thing my goodness look what's happened over the years I just collected\nToo much I can turn into a box is\nIn boxes and boxes of stuff you don't want to be at the mercy of identity thieves or something like that she got to be careful with disposing of this stuff it's not easy\nIt is and and if we first talked about I mean there are two parts to this is your personal belongings and sentimental values\nBut we also have bookkeeping types of things in tax records so certain professionals particularly small business owners Dr Denis lowers account and you can be required to retain records for flight a few years and we know the IRS generally has three years to initiate an odd at\n... bought you might wanna hold on just certain records including some actual returns for longer than that period of time\nThis it would also be important to do if it relates to the purchasing capital improvements on your home if\nIt has to deal with the purchase of stocks or other investments are funds inside of your taxable investment accounts want to make sure that your\nWhen you go to sell those items you're not paying access tax and a really big one if you are doing a non detectable IRA contribution or you have an idea right where some of it was pre tax in some post tax\nYou've got to keep really good record them if you wanted to make sure that the taxes you're paying on that account when you make your distributions are accurate all these refer to determining your accurate tax basis in order to avoid paying more taxes than what you actually all sorts of paperwork part of that that\nCan be a bit I'm a bit disconcerting for people\nI think so we tend to overdo it and we keep too much and so we've started to see more and more people and I've talked to a lot of people who say yeah I'm ... I'm I\nTook all this paperwork and shredded so much when they did it for at a time and recently um they're trying to get rid of stuff and it can be a bit of Treme yeah you got an old pair of shoes that are torn up that's not too tough to figure out\nSome things but even some of your personal records like what about a lot of people may retire right that ride a personal history\nOr your memoirs yeah and what if you thrown out some of your records that might um written records that might help you keep track\nOf those kinds of things I Know I did years ago I got rid of my records from my childhood just records that you play music on and who they thought that those became worth something later on actually retained one of them which I still hold onto\nAnd take very good care of that and even something that your grandparents had it could be a special blanket that they had it I'm\n... I Know that could be collectible ... collectibles mean a lot to you there are people\nPrecious moments come to mind there are people who collect any number of them\nThose kinds of items so when you're looking at stuff you know think for a minute to make sure you're making the right decision now also in the future but what's important what's not and and just because something is old doesn't mean that it's necessarily junk\nYou were looking at me when you said that I appreciate [laughter] here's another one that I think is really difficult to de clutter photos because a photo\n... it was made it a certain point a moment in time you can't go back and replace it so you've got all these old photos and quite frankly some of them aren't so great\nThat they really don't deserve to be saved but their photos\nThey are and it's really easy to say oh that one had red eye in it or this other one guy that was when I didn't look as good as I wished I Would have loved and so you saw photos thinking about how you look but then later say wait a minute there are people in that\nOh that I Would rather have added pictures of our I'd like to see myself with that particular family member whether it's kids that have grown up more whether it's people that are eventually moved far away or you haven't seen in many years perhaps they passed away and just so the memories of those voters are pretty important and I know anymore\nAnd my house we've been working on\nPutting them ... them in some way\nThat's a good way to do it because once they're digitized they really don't take up much space at all that's a real easy solution digitize yes\nAnd then clothing I close always come back and I have I'm Phyllis style and they do come back and there's actually two things that I kept from\nAll the years of moving from when I was a teenager young adult and both had to do with dresses that were stylish at that time one I may well when I made in my my mother had made for me\nAnd I've kept them because they're so I guess words iconic are there still retro whatever word is used but I can periodically pulled them out and wear them to sometimes a costume party sometimes seemed and vent and they always get a really good attention so you think about that too\nSo I should just wait on those bill but I'm blue jeans come back into fashion\nOr wait until you get invited to some type of themed party where it would come in handy yeah All right I mean I didn't keep tons of stuff I did but I did pick out the couple of items that were just like I knew I Would really like and want to keep for the future and they've held up while which is great\nTo be a little bit careful about throwing out some of that a clothing be careful about throwing out say a jewelry for example it it's really easy to throw out some valuable jewelry along with some of the costume jewelry\nOr that you feel you don't want any more be careful about that there are people who go to yard sales and in binge just looking for that\nKind of mistake and the reason why you should make it I'm doing I think there's just some of this uh\nThere's some sentimental value or somebody gave you something somebody in the family gave you something and then you say if I get rid of this what stuff\nIt is it is very very difficult to know what to keep and what to get rid of 'em\nI Know one of the things are like scrap books when you when you were a teenager maybe those old yearbooks and that's really was kind of a piece of your life\nAnd I know how I have a section where I've got different scrapbooks and things like that or from things from family members what about that you know some of those old black and white photos and when my mom had to go to a care home I she gave me a bunch of that family albums and they do take up space and those I haven't yet\nI'm digitized but they will be and um but I Do want to hold on to them and a lot of them are black like unfortunately there's a couple of people I don't know who they are\nAt this point and I wished I did and I don't know how to find out who they are but I'm\nHopeful that someday somebody somewhere will know who these couple of people are\nI tell you it's tough and I look back I moved in the past year I moved to a different house and so as we were packing everything up we said you know will will run a a yard sale\nAnd then whatever we don't solve a yard sale will take that on over for a for charitable donations and it helped to pay some of the expenses that we were having in in moving not much but if a few bucks\nAnd that was great but I remember as the yard sale was going on you know the\nGarage doors open somebody sees the trash can that I have in my garage this is how much for the trash can I see a dollar [laughter] I sold my trash cans for a dollar\nThat's hilarious [laughter] turns out you know I mean that's declaring to the extremes\nYeah that'll carried away there now I don't have a trash can actually I take that back I Do because a friend of ours recently moved into assisted living\nAnd we helped her with a with a yard sale and and the sale of her home and I'm at the end ... nobody bought her trash cans so she gave it to me\nHere I think it's great to share feedback from people that are really taking the product\nYeah here's one from ... in Texas she gives asked to have the X.\nFive stars and she writes quote after

with Sherry Turkle she can you share with us a quick study or to to sort of backed us up highlight the science behind the elite asked his anthem was found and asked the FX 'cause I Know there were dozens and dozens of studies maybe you can pull out and buy like a couple of your favorites\nYeah for sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD a biomedical research or he explains that well he's talking here about how free radicals compromise and undermine function and sell you the performance in the body he says after the Anthony simply PR at negating this\nAs evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated\nRecovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine and science in sports and exercise found that those who took four milligrams of after than than daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output than those who did not take it for the bike faster you\nMay remember this after that and it's one of the few\nThat fireball antioxidants that can actually neutralize free radicals even at the site at the mitochondrial membrane it's like\nA sailor body armor protecting yourself your joints blood vessels brain heart and Oregon's on many levels\nValues impressive on so many levels so much rain information there and I know this last as Anthonette was about a dozen happens to\nI'm looking here I see it as a patent for promoting I held\nAnd reducing I fatigue there's a pattern for inhibiting the expression of cytokines in sales end up happening is on the composition for body fat reduction\nThere's one for improving muscle atrophy an older adult Sherry I like to be a little bit of a skeptic here how can this one simple nutrients magically do all of this disaster ... give us so many benefits I mean really\nYeah I Know it it sounds amazing too good to be true but it really is true\nMany studies that I'm referencing here they're available on top met these are reputable clinical studies conducted by leading researchers around the world that really back that benefits of asked his aunt and by the way muscle I put it that are with us for that too and this comes from after that that research published in the international journal sports nutrition\nNovember two thousand and eleven this with another study done with cyclists they took for granted access than than it was a\nSmall study but very positive showing that cyclists improved their trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometer bike race I mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and\nThe researchers said that they also burn fat more efficiently which makes sense\nBased on this research purity can actually make the claim that asked FX will promote and improve power output\nYour muscles I mean I tell people asked FX in his strength and power out its transformative if you like energy and this is found in other studies to like one that looked at hand grip strength\nAlso much great information ministry I Want to share a couple of more testimonials that caught my attention out of so many right there on the purity website again these are\nUnsolicited these are from real people here's one from Rick sees male age fifty five\nTo sixty four lives in Naples, Florida he writes this\nWhat a great product to ask the FX has been for me after starting taking as to my workout and strings has increased as if I were in my

website and Jerry I'm looking at the list of happens again on this asked his anthem compound this is where the\nYou know the science research backs up we're talking about this is just flat out amazing in this area a lot of people out there are going to think when I'm going to say here sounds a little bit odd but you said before the show this supplement may even help people drive a car better or use

hour I raised in a an interesting question\nAnd now that you can call in I can pursue it I had this experience with my wife was shopping for a few of the first time I've always just driven a car and anyway shopping from SUV and I are very rarely shop for cars because\nFor much of my the last decade side in driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they sold their businesses in any way shape or whatever it is it now as we're having a new experience to haven't had in a while ago in a car dealers him I don't want to give car dealers the business I Want to do with all your Internet I Want to know what to do with the you know with car dealers [noise]\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's about an issue there almost all young men with whom I took test drugs I think in every instance real foggy for things for four or five the five were young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean ... any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no embarrassment\nI'll look it up oh let me let me this look that up\nSo uh as I said at the end I think that if this is it all representative and it may not be like fully acknowledge that but it's it is an oil representative\n\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey I could look it up\nWhy why do I have to know if that is you can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the lines of the of the SUV versus the other ones it's like ... all I could always look it up on the other is in general knowledge or may not be valued\nWhy do you need to know what he's saying if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pockets and find out you need to know\n\nThis is now if you feel that my general generalization is not valid or you do a very curious\nTo hear from you because it made a real impact on us I Am trusting of at the lines are working on a ... seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nThat was a that was one\nAspect of the experience that hit me there was another one too which is even deeper\nThan that is that the\nThere was a there seems to be an absence of passion I again I remember from years ago when I when I last really went looking for cars with dealers the the the sales\nFolks were passionate about cars that's why they were in that profession I didn't have that sense from any of these are salespeople again all the young I didn't have any sense of or if they were passionate about cars\nThat was it was they might as well I've been working at a shoe store this is not a negative these were very nice people I'm not ... not a character challenge it's just a statement of a change that\nYou know if you haven't seen anybody you know in the law you ever seen a young person in the long term wow boy did you grow you really groom because you haven't seen them so you see if you haven't seen something in a long time you can see a change\nSo this was a change that we saw a gentleman who you are just so many folks are statistical question our our launch working is what is your story shoulder you know\nOkay anyway ah\nWhat was we'll find out\nOh they're not working you know what I'm Sorry folks like giving you rolling information I was given the information\nBut the lines are up about okay these are unfortunate things that I must admit annoying me but you know live with it and you got to live with it and that's the way it works\nThat's what I saw though there was it was in it and and then I translated that into as well\nThey didn't seem you can sense it\nIn in young people specifically addressing men whether it's a very ambitious or enough and I wonder too if in this generation but we have in some ways it created a less ambitious\nYoung male or have theories on that but let me go now to my guess mine would be looking forward to talking to John from Iraq senior editor of the stream the come off or\nThe excellent politically correct guy to immigration and John I was reading your article today it is it begins with so many valid points you make more valid points in a paragraph that most people do in the book\nThank you but it's ... dot org I Want people to be

I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt disgrace totally turned back Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't waving Nazi flags and singing German nationalist\nSongs and talking about how they're going to transform English us in the U.S in Germany damage I mean that the people are mixing up the Jewish refugees in Germany with the German American button you know\nUm these people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by the government's they're they're just living in kinda crappy countries\nYou know and those countries are crappy for a reason\nUh for historical and cultural and political reasons that 'cause they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad dictatorial political culture from Spain\nUh whereas we inherited a kind of an anti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England and as a result they have been worse government worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things there's a great\nLatin American economists her and her and I think his name I turn on the court a ... I think it's ...\nSoto was found out\nThis photo and he said if you enforce property rights for the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from thugs and from drug lords\nLatin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence\nOf it they were fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people they they come in and start working their kids will grow up properly I public assistance\nLarge percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a honey pot full of benefits from the government and you know why the Catholic my own Catholic churches so gung ho about this refugee armada [noise]\nForty percent of the U.S Catholic bishops income comes from the U.S government\nFrom programs to serve immigrants forty percent is government contracts and one out of four five Catholics in America is now an immigrant mostly from Latin America because our bishops had been walling in these scandals\nAnd running gait bath house is labeled a seminary so one out of five to four American Catholics has left the church\nI'm Sorry not one at a four four and a cat for Catholics born in America can leave the church and the only way to replace them without reforming the church is to bring in more cannon fodder for Latin America which also brings in hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government\nYou are made a point to me last time and it it it just shook me up because it makes so much sense if you can feel the church with Americans you have to bring in none of Americans\nWho will last or maybe ten or Twenty years and then they'll get disgusted and they will join a Protestant Church because they don't want to have get bishops bug ... seminarians they don't want to have the way she is that many priests who have boyfriends they they don't want the child abuse running or emphysema [noise]\nIf ... if somebody bags on your door and says he's homeless and demands to live in your living room\nYou have a right to shut the door and use whatever forces are required\nTo stop someone from staying in your house and eating your food against your will the exact same thing occurs applies to us as a country is our country of common home that we work on and we improve and we leave to our children were grateful our grandparents we lead to our children we judiciously accept newcomers or something to offer\nOr are we just on a giant refugee camp like the ones we see you know in Turkey and Jordan where anybody who shows up you have to take him and then you put them on the same girl and given the same uniform and they and they gather around the same trash you know trash cans with the fire\nIs that the future of America\nTo me politically this is gonna happen\nPresumably right before the incredibly important congressional elections right and I I I I worry given the ... the media\nThat we will just have video after video and photo after photo of some American either military person or ice personal border guards\nAre pushing some mom with a baby and then uh it's it's it seems to me the when the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets that George Soros funded attorney\nYou know that's not to forgive me job that's not the propaganda war that's winning the war I agree but the propaganda war you know me\nI I think one of those ... let me let me just breaking point\nIt seems to me that they win if they get in and the women so you don't get it and I don't\nBecause if they are good I Hope you're right there's no science I you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness\nIf he caves then Republicans across the country we just our hearts saying so we realized the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIt it's even Donald Trump can't say no to something this ludicrous and politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress turnout\nLine I I agree with you I agree with you I just I agree with you I think if he got dance farm if he's yes if you have to learn\nThat that will mean in picture in pictorial form that they will be fight between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us because I think people see that this is an invasion they can see it the people who are going to cry because a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back those people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out\nFor it toward otherwise going to turn out this is a national impeachment referendum the less space has already fanatical they've got their their ... ready they're ready to go to the polls they've got their dead people registered to vote but left his

thanks for mentioning that again you know there was a parallel between the Catholic bishops and leaders of the Democratic party and that's not just that they're often cousins of each other because it

given up on large parts of the Latino community they just want to win port new voters across the border who will take the place of the blacks and Hispanics who are walking away from the Democratic party staying home or even voting Republican because of the failed Democrat policies in exactly the same way\nThe Catholic bishops have utterly failed in their job and stewards\nAnd it and apostles every last one of them with one or two exceptions should resign and get a job at the post office where I hear they're pretty good pensions and I'm In each case they've decided they're unhappy with the

of weeks ago and we got a tremendous response most people were very positive and actually talked about how his experience mirrored their own [noise]\nThe whole theme of his piece was he's a middle aged stay at home dad he's also\nThe greatest living American writer how do I know that because it says right on his website and uh he certainly did do a great job writing that particular column or Neal Pollack it's great to meet you over the phone\nThat hey Michael how are you\nHey I'm doing well I um [noise] I I ... I\nJust wanted to ask you they at the outset eat your piece was actually scary and sad and very honest\nAnd how long how many years did you feel that you had a problem with marijuana\nMe it's hard to gauge how many years I actually had a problem I I smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades and I would say at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid it\nSo a long time how do you know you over did it\nWell now that I'm sober I can look back on some of the uh who might be have years when I was high and and realize that uh\nThat pot was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having a public meltdown even temper tantrums even uh getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also wasn't sleeping normally\nI I was I was kind of ... and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time thinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume and about the consumers with about trips I could take that would revolve around marijuana and you know it just kind of became\nThe center of my life for very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you you've been married for a while Ryan\nHas been married for Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was still you know I was a you know basically like a professional hipster right I mean I published a capitalist ten bucks I had a couple of a script deals in Hollywood I you know I've written for\nYou know pretty much every English language publication except for the New Yorker you know I'd say that it's not like I [noise] I was a um an on ambitious donor or a failure but I I sometimes wonder\nHow much more successful I Would have been if I hadn't been soaked in marijuana the whole time and I I certainly would have a you know live my life with more integrity and getting carried out my ah my business affairs with we made it more efficiently and I also just would have been able to devote more time to my family\nHow long how long have you been sober\nA my one year anniversary is November left so I'm going to make it I'm pretty sure that I relapsed at them coming before that so I'll just say a year\nOkay well good for you congratulations on that and what\nAdvantages do you see now that your non smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of oracle to want to buy because in some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I Would you know I I wrote almost all my books by all the time and I I Can't although in retrospect there there's a law that there are a lot of scenes in the novels that are about getting hot\nAnd I I think there will be fewer of those but you know I it it it helped me come up with certain flights fancy indeed some jokes\nAre ... and it was a creative stimulant in some ways but uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative since I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends um I'm Better organized um I I I Can't say I'm making more money but I feel like why life is in order professionally in a way that at work which is not as much chaos and I'm and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows\nWithout it's happening when I was using marijuana you know I'm not I'm not super up all the time and and then when I when I bought 'em out I don't bottom out there's there's no there's no high or low it was like I said so I'm not having the melt down that would characterize a sort of my my addiction cycle\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number ... speaking with Neal Pollack who wrote about how marijuana almost ruined his life yeah one thing you you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years\nDoes your wife ever share a your enthusiasm for ah read\nNo and in fact you know she was just the opposite does she she has no interest in it at all\nUm and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem I Would just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know 'cause the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive ... in some ways\nIt's considered a health food um and so I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism in my family um and obviously had the addiction gene I just did it it just didn't register with me\nUm maybe it should have you know they've always ducking behind the dumpster on the weight walking to the gym so he you know take a hit so it'd be high wall of working out there that's not the signs of someone who is necessarily healthy but uh you know I just\nI ah I didn't see it she did and she she was so grateful when I finally made the decision to quit\nYou know I ... you use the figures in your in your piece that I I I think they're generally accepted to you from the journal of the American Medical Association and based on studies done in a number of countries they suggest that uh some nine percent of people\nWhoever use marijuana end up getting addicted\nAnd Seventeen percent of people use marijuana is teenagers did you first used to wait as a teenager\nI smoked once at a party when I was in high school but you know when I was when I was a teenager and this was you know the Nineteen eighties I was I was sort of a\nGo getter do gooder student council type sort of a modeling myself maybe not politically but like at least in terms of my lifestyle on you know Michael J. Fox is character from Family Guy that was my model like I wouldn't go ... I was going to be successful I was going to be as great American citizens and\nUm and so part didn't really play into it um you know in college I kind of um\nI I went a little uh [noise] I I I'm a member of generation X. and so I you know I I I became kind of a a grouchy pop culture sitting there but I still was doing a lot of drugs or it wasn't until I was in my twenties that I said I really started a consuming it\nSo it was an adult onset addiction\nRain rain I view I'm ever tried to calculate how much money you invested in and buying lead over the years so\nOh I mean it was probably a few thousand dollars you know the the thing is it and you know and and this is a brag it's just a fact you know I there was a time there were I was a ... you know well known writer and people would just give me drugs or or smoke me up and I I'm I'm kind of some\nInherently cheap so I Would look for situation to where I ... I knew I'd be around people who would have it so I wouldn't have to buy but of course I still would sometimes you know when I Lived in LA I had a medical marijuana card out here I drove to Colorado for a week and it's been a hundred two hundred bucks so it didn't bankrupt me in that sense but\nIt you know it's still it was still even on a month where it was really good at ... still caught me at least fifty dollars about a hundred bucks\nAnd I know you you you've written a since you've written this ... sentence obviously\nCausing a graced or have you done so negative reaction from some of your old friends\nAlthough people have been very supportive I got a few people in wonderful go\nYeah I mean generally when someone announces that they're an addict the reaction is that like your baking it or [laughter]\nYou know you're ... it's not you know or or you're not an addict I mean if you have you gone through what if you go through the twelve step program guided there's no way you can know anyone could say that you're not an addict I mean I wouldn't have done it if I was it but uh\nCharacter flaws and then you try to fill the gaps with whatever the addictive substances and he mentioned do a whole list of them yeah alcohol drugs gambling sex eating shopping list goes on and off so yeah I mean that's an absolutely accurate a\nStatement and I I don't think anyone who's ever um\nSuffer from addiction would would disagree with that\nLet's go to Steve in Louisville, Kentucky Steve you're on the show was Neal Pollack\nWell Michael thanks for having me on so new and just listening to talk it seems like we live a very weird life just just in different places um I kind of wonder how many people were out there like us I'm certainly the years\nOf consumption of marijuana for all I can ... the um you know ... has it affected you know you mentioned it seemed like you were a little conflict is\nHas to in order to help your wife or ...\nFor me you know I didn't have or avoid that I was trying to feel a little uh marijuana we just kind of stumbled across to each other but certainly the creative aspect that may be a little bit more on the artistic side of the visual side\nI feel that it's it's certainly a struggle and and my main question was what the show was what finally made you quit\nYeah that's a good question and to address the thing you were saying it's like it's just marijuana is kind of creeps up on you right it's not like I'm\nYou know heroin where you're ... if you get addicted very fast I'm In Philly you can use it for a number of years that's sort of a low level is gradually increases as for me that my moment of clarity can act of ironically enough\nThat the Dodgers are back in the world series that actually came at the world series I ... I went to Los Angeles because I'd always dreamed of going all World Series game even though I didn't really have the resources to do it\nAnd I bought a ticket off of some fraudulent third party Web site before I did that I managed to get as high as I possibly could um even though you know there's no reason why you need to get hired and go to the world series but I needed to get hired and do everything and that was a special occasion so I got really high\nUm smoking the huge joined it had all this crystallized th ... all over and then I moved from smoking weed with a stranger in in his house in echo park I went to the stadium\nBombed out on my mind and the ticket didn't scan it was it was like I said it was fraudulent 'em and rather than deal with the situation rationally I started screaming at people and I was almost got arrested I got it scored it\nOut of the stadium or by security guards I was in the parking lot sobbing and I just kind of took a look at myself into a side view mirror of a car and I just saw this old man with red rimmed eyes\nCrying but we're a baseball game and I just I thought to myself this isn't good I Can't go on like this and so I didn't quit that day but three weeks later I got a ... and I just took my left off and\nKen Daniel more around haven't voted can can you be around other people who were getting high or use our would you go into the

I think exploring how important is a honeymoon\nI can see a very good argument for right after the marriage\nJumping into a normal life I can also see a great argument for getting away from everybody and just having time for the two I I I'm not an advocate here about having a honeymoon I'm not an advocate for having one I think that there are good arguments for for both\nOr or delaying you know for six months or something if some people do because they just can't get away if that time but I I don't know the answer I don't know if the honeymoon has been\nA a generally positive force in bomb being people or irrelevant or even counterproductive I don't I don't have an answer to that\nIt would be interesting study to engage in however but that's not really the question it's it may be the upshot of the hour but it's not the question of the the question of the hour is\nHow much related uh is was your honeymoon as if to the rest of your marriage was it a good predictor all righty\nLet's go to our best in Philadelphia Hi Beth thank you for calling\nTo talk to you good\nHealth and well actually the summer for the first time after celebrate ... years [noise]\nAnd the second time around what Chuck amazing it's the first time but one one funny thing from our bureau how clever\nTogether prior to our honeymoon we definitely need\nA little little habits like for example ah you know I really like my sleep and like and you know he'd be waiting and waiting for me to start our days activities that you know I didn't really get away from\nEveryday life had to learn a little bit about each other\nIn ways that we hadn't\nSo you know I Am for from what you said you were not living together prior to marriage\nFor religious reasons yeah [noise]\nSo that you you have just given me another topic for a male female our\nBecause I Wonder if the honeymoon is not more exciting if you didn't live together\nI mean how could it not be [laughter]\nI mean that was definitely the anticipation for the wedding night for sure [laughter]\nI like you are as your husband is happy as you are\nIncredible man that I Know\nWow you are\n[laughter] ... that is in hot or I Would love to meet the two of you I I really my next time you you got to come to a speech but my next time in Philadelphia\nOkay All right\nThank you God I ...

O'Reilly walked back to the dentist Prager show\nThanks for in the book that I appreciate it [noise]\nI think you've done a a memorial service in writing this and I was I think to be honest it was somewhat of a gamble on your part because so much has been written about the Holocaust and about the Nazis and so so I'll ask you then what prompted you to do this\nEvil I'm seeing a rise and evil in America I'm\nTalking about people walking into schools gunning down students\nThousands shot in Chicago by drug gangs clerics um abusing shouldering a this just small pure evil across the board and um well what about those stories I came to the conclusion that Americans are numb\nAnd I'm not deceitful and and I you know we issued statements visited with no wrongdoing and it was a shame that uh what happened happened but we went right over to bill O'Riley dot com and we have a news agency over there a half hour of analysis every day it's fabulously successful and I don't have to work for anybody\nAnd I liked that Prager\nI don't have to work for anybody I'm working for myself and I\nThat I think is the big a regulation in my life that I Am so reliable\nLoyal is just through the best ... you're working as a best selling book in the country and you're not on Fox I mean it gives so I'm saying if it proves you're ongoing appeal art now let's get back to the book you were mentioning the Odessa issue uh with regards to Nazis\nOr getting a scape patches in Latin America and the middle east did Odessa actually exist\nYes no I don't know whether they call themselves their desks or not but the set up a was um that the they used the two letters S. S. because of a of Hitler\nAnd what they did was they have this apparatus and you ask the question was what surprised you please shut up this apparatus and they have tons of gold and tons of looted a cash\nA and they have assassins\nWorking for them and and the the organization had rat line what Martin garden I call a rat line from Germany to Italy gentle way Italy where they got these ss guys down there put 'em on boats and then they went where they went most of them to Argentina where the ... government was bribed\nTo allow them in and to keep them they're protected so the red cross out of Switzerland to help the ss so did the uh beginning CIA\nAnd soda elements of the Catholic Church and I'm Catholic so all of that surprised me and we documented pretty thoroughly in a book and then the track down um you would think that the Israeli government would really want to get these guys in the beginning they did not\nAnd they didn't want to reopen this and they wanted to concentrate on protecting the new state of Israel from the Arab threat and they had to be badgered\nInto tracking down Eichmann in manga law and the others that surprised us and then there's no surprises all across the book individual stories that we tell\nSo let me ask you you I Love the fact that you have a preoccupation with evil says been me much three since I was in high school so I I asked the Holocaust survivor men went through outfits\nThe rabbi Leon ... passed away and I I was with him for many many years and I finally interviewed him and I asked him how does she how did he explain the ss guards in the camps and their sadism\nAnd he used the phrase that I have kept in my mind ever since it's the the one thing that I truly remember from my interview and he said they were monsters with human faces do you subscribe to that theory\n[noise] capsule literally means as his people didn't go to hell university and they and they warn people who were uh in prison for violent crimes they were farmers shopkeepers lawyers\nWho before World War two live normal lives you saw him in the cafes she waived Adam [noise] they're all of a sudden the war starts when they sign up they get a black uniform in a dead set in ... to put on her cap\nThey walk into our with another camps and they brutalized people to the extent that modern civilization has never seen they kill babies they gas women they do the most heinous evil things that anyone could imagine and then after the war they go back to the towns\nAnd they take up their farming again it's unbelievable and that's why I wanted to tell everyone reads the book and every one that I Do these interviews with that evil exists in every person\nAnd you have to fight it you have to actively fight it or it can envelop you and if there's anything from killing the ss that's it\n\nQuiet because I'm I'm thinking of because of money for you to think about that [noise] ah so let me tell you something that I still audiences have my whole life the difference between my religious education in a regular secular education\nI was taught that my biggest problem in life is Dennis Prager in secular life there's talk that their biggest problem is America and that's a very big difference when you learn to like yourself or your word to fight your society\n[noise] Americans are being misled\nPrimarily for political reasons\nAbout the true

character respects the characteristic of the left\nRemember from the boat to fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen\nShe writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing remains deliberately 'cause I have no desire to a metal leftist I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she is she they're interchangeable they have the feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left\nBut but it is interesting that there's no mention in any of the columns by her or older women riding in this column in the Washington Post that may be part of the solution to their loneliness and she says I have never been so little east to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the the word marriage does not even enter she's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken but cheap there is no mention of of marriage so she wants to which way you show loneliness\nWe've relationship or even an unappealing\nTemporary are fleeing would appear from what I'm reading\nThe divide between men and women is never felt so why am I have never been so lonely too what she described that I Know what I ascribe a two\nAnd then she strikes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours\nAnd he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted to eat lunch he said whatever you're comfortable with and now I read to read from her over the course of three hours that lie became as ... ... she didn't like that\nAnd then why even not only put in bold for myself but underline what it was time to part\nWays I was comfortable giving him a platonic code but\nIt was not sexy being the one in the driver's seat for three hours\nSo if the manager of the driver CDs of patriarchal guy and uh probably somewhat of a massage therapist and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy well and then she wonders why she has never been so lonely in her life\nBecause what the feminist like Old West is within the make believe world\nReality it is is awful\nThen they have an imaginary world were things will be better so she says if the ... the man is a dominant decision maker that's a glaring red flags that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with\nI don't need a man she says to ask permission for every movie makes fun of course that is exactly the way young men are taught today you have to ask permission for every move you make we shouldn't let the battle\nWhy of consent translate into boring sex see this as they say this to say that they want their cake and eat it is like it's still tried they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important in every one's intentions during sex should be of care healing and relief not personal appetite implying conquest you're going to move personal appetite from sex all it's going to be used care healing and relief sounds like a visit to a social worker or therapist\nOkay now I Want to read to you from another one\nBy a different feminists are also in the Washington Post this one is from October fifth do you know where your date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you showed\nSo she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first dates but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh\n[noise] so she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup I told a friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh Detroit the title but listen to this again\nI told a friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships and method oblique can bring\n\nDid you hear that this is a grown woman their children left his two children that party they do want to grow up I Want to be open\nTo love but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships inevitably can bring why don't you say that about anything else I'm open to working but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds\nThat working for a living can bring I Want to live fully but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that life it negatively can bring\nI told you there children there was no exception leftists are at heart the children they do not want to grow up\nGrowing up means facing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms and all that stuff they are snowflakes some of them are even my snowflakes but they're snowflakes they're not grown ups\nDoes it amazing thing she admits this like the other woman admitted in the Washington Post how lonely she is and how crappy relations between men and women are\nI now I continue reading at that\nMoment it's so difficult to do both now I imagine a lot of theaters feel stuck in the same dilemma really that's not true\nLeftist leaders are stuck in this dilemma conservatives haven't mature understanding of life it involves inevitable pain there is a pain in life this is if you can't do anything about it\nLife has pain you want to live fully that's the garden of Eden story people chose pain and full life over ... little pain or no pain and not a full life\nI'm finishing my huge genesis commentary in fact this month it'll be up to an army first\nOh by the way just to remind her the among my this is the rational bibles but that's my five volume commentary on the first five volumes\nIt's been so successful the we're going on the fourth printing of ... is the first volume was on the second book\nYes yes I don't want to wait wait don't allow me forgive me I just want to understand you wouldn't want to argue with you watch what I'm saying you you you you would not seek to remarry because you don't want to be hurt and you don't want to hurt someone else\nThat event yet and I don't I don't trust to my self and making that decision\nOh okay that's a separate okay that's\nRight that's different but first of all this woman is is is is middle aged oil ... you know forty to fifty\nUh and uh she she never even mentions that she just talks about relationships where am I think that she would do better if she actually saw to get married but I wasn't at all the basis of my critique the basis of my critique was\nThat she's ... she's very lonely she doesn't like the idea is that a man just to is it not assertive and then if you use assertive then he's obviously not someone she feel safe with so no wonder she's lonely\nI think part of it is what I heard again I don't know who their background but\nI don't know what I saw it as someone who may have had for both of them may be more strong feminist position and now they're kind of struggling with well I found myself in this dichotomy you know I have faith that strong\nWill cut right through it yes I agree with you and and now I agree with you know you have a person\nRight but at no point the she challenged feminism\n\nBut it may be her own personal statement and again if people are familiar with this particular person maybe they're the evolution as well I mean I'm a Democrat I so I have to be left progressive\nUm positions but I think when it comes to this and my relationships and kind of my sense of\nOh no you know I I notice they're scared to do this again that's like human\nEither calming or whatever I don't feel that they already attached to one\nSide or another politically as\nGets okay All right I appreciate your call very much a Cassie in Torrance, California Hi Cathy\nHi Dana Hi [noise]\nUm I just called to loud and I'm a ... a story that I heard from a recounting from my son about five years ago he is\nNow old is your son thirty two so he wanted his locate\nSo it's probably four or five years ago I was telling me about child attempting to date and\nHe said he found young women so aggressive that when you're trying to get to know them it's a little like a job interview they want to know um [noise]\nHow much money you have in my kind of car you drive and what your goals are at immediately you know not just a friendly let's get to know each other by a very aggressive grilling\n... so ironically if that's the case I have to say the word is but if that's the case so the argument that men will see women as sex objects is is matched by women who see men as financial objects\nWhich by the way there is some truth to both not necessarily a terrible thing to just the way people were built we have to live with it\nWe have to figure out how to live with real life\nThem if you do your

sustains and benefits this great nation it's the American family [noise]\nAnd yeah there are new numbers\nThat reinforce some other recent numbers\nIndicate that the American family at least as we've understood it\nIt now turns out that ah if you look at the number of birds that have an outside marriage [noise]\nIn the United states we are beyond forty per se\nAnd were perhaps approaching a day or the statistician say\nNot so long from now where the majority of children will be born a into on wedded families now there are a couple of reasons why this situation is dire\nAnd there and a couple of other reasons why it may not be quite as dire as we would suppose\nBut let me first uh give you some of the background of that is put together through a new report from yep you got to the United nations the United nothing and it also puts America's problems in the context of the rest of the world if you believe it's no problem at all\nThat we have almost half of the children born in the United states born into a non married couple or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five\nFive Seventeen Seventy six our phone number ... Bloomberg an increasing number of birds happen outside of marriage signaling cultural signaling cultural and economic shifts\nThat are here to stay according to a major new report from the United nations forty percent of all births in the U.S now with her outside of wedlock that is up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy\nWould then means to put it in context is that in in less than fifty years the rate of out of wedlock birth has grown up for a hundred percent\nWhy would that be\nThis report was issued by un FDA that as the United nations population fund it's the largest international provider\nOf sexual and reproductive health services says the number is even higher in the European Union and the European Union already sixty percent of birds occur outside of marriage the eat eat you\nReport says likely sees more births out of wedlock because many member countries have welfare systems that support gender balanced childcare so said the senior advisor in economics for the un FBI his name is Michael ... and in an interview\nHe said a public health care systems paid paternal leave early education programs in tax incentives given where\nParents support beyond what a partner can provide\nAnd is he saying from the un this is a good thing in Europe that you have sixty percent of kids born out of wedlock set a good thing using developmentally the government can do a better job than parents or even the government can do a better job\nThan some parents by providing these services one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\n[noise] look the problems with a single parent families are fairly obvious\nBut one of the things worth noting here with these numbers the reason that then I'm indicating to you that that forty percent number born out of wedlock\nMaybe a bit overstated is at least in terms of meaningful consequences is because that includes couples who are actually living together but decided for whatever reason not to get married\nAnd it is unclear what percentage of people who have a baby outside of marriage then follow that up by getting married\nIt's not a small numbers at least twenty five percent at least one out of four people were a baby is born to a couple of outside of marriage end up getting married and particularly if they do that while the child is very young and has no recollection of and it it it can provide some of the same benefits of marriage by we what are the benefits of marriage\nWas one of those things if you spent any time at all in your life around the baby you understand immediately it's an extra pair of hands and extra pair of eyes\nIt's a extra loved that can be provided to the child and if you have one person who was also going to be responsible for trying to provide an income\nWell what happens to the child or two children and this is not\nTo blame a single mothers it's not to say that single mothers are terrible people or that because obviously there are wonderful wonderful results that do occur sometimes with single mothers but it's very\nVery difficult and single fathers same thing it can happen that that things will work out beautifully but the idea that there should be brought up as an ideal or isn't acceptable ideal\nI think it's very destructive and if you take a look at the vastly greater likelihood of being involved in poverty\nCriminality self destructive activities like opioid abuse every risk for bad outcomes with a child is increased by a child who was raised in a single parent household\n\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and somebody can say well what about gay marriage why uh what's what's been the impact there the fact is that gay marriage his remains so rare in the United states such a small percentage of the population one of the stunning things and this from the Census Bureau\nOf the marriages that have taken place in this country since ... since the decision that basically authorize gay marriage for every state in the union\nLess than one percent or have been same sex couples yeah it's a shockingly low number\nAnd that's shockingly low because a lot of people it assumed though there will be pent up demand there will be all these couples that have been waiting to get married still less than one percent the the highest rate for gay marriage in the country was built a shot San Francisco Seattle a second\nBut even in San Francisco their dream about one point for nine percent of all the marriages actually were marriages between a same sex couple\nThe data shows such births in the U.S and in the e or predominantly to unmarried couples who are living together rather than to single mothers the report says\nThe data suggests that societal and religious norms about marriage childbearing and women in the workforce of changed\nSaid Kelly Jones the director for the center on the economics of reproductive health at the Institute for women's policy research is it a good thing is they've changed\nI I I don't believe that it is in other words it was a fairly common in American Life to have what were called shots done weddings where\nA couple actually concedes the baby before they're married not recommended but they do but then there's social pressure for them to get married so the baby as well coming into a married home of course that's more desirable\nAnd and by getting married you were making a commitment to that child into each other\n\nJust someone down the idea that in most cases in of course I understand there are exceptions there are some times spouses who are abusive and self destructive and terrible and that can be a terrible situation for a child but in most cases\nIt's better for a child to deal with both a loving mother and a loving father\n\nLet's go to your calls to Andrea in Columbus ohio Andrew you're on the show\nThanks for taking my call you back um\nSo um for me um I have a wonderful husband and um I I think that parents have to be mentally crafts and they have to be physically present\nOkay the idea that they get married later find good glad to see that but what about all those couples and and we know this is couples who are cohabiting\nAre much less likely to last long term than couples that are actually married and there's a wealth of data that makes that clear let's go to Bob in Cleveland, Ohio Bob you're on the Michael ...\nI think instead of trying to go back to the cash that society we should adapt to these new trends\nAnd find new ways of helping these kids ... and I just want to say it is you know back in you know maybe a hundred years ago uh you know that much richer so high\nThat often a parent would die\nIn the trial would or maybe you have to wait what their grandma parents or relatives or other relatives\nShow I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded to these tranche\nBut what does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends are it sounds very open minded and terrific [noise]\nWhat does it mean that we need government programs horse\nThat would that would be to kids living in a single parents that George Bush\nAnd look at what kind of ... thinking of you want the government to send babysitter zeroes damage government day care centers\nI think we're going to get care shortage would be one way I think manners where you do you pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these these children and help them out\nOkay do I let me just mention something to you Bob I I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what they're sometimes families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children\nAnd their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income to provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nI I Know you're gonna wish but uh I I I'm going to say the ... where she cut defense spending because it's just\nIt's just not necessary and we should also leash characters on the rich\nOK well of course when a sandwich I hate this on my shelves you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the and opinion in most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs and the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and has been shown by a wealth of books and information um\nThere is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that the blue the lid off the welfare system and the way the welfare system as it had been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society actually encouraged out of wedlock\nBirth and they're Democrats civil written about that than you'll Patrick
