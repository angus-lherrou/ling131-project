important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick\nYou know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm going to have a water main break into where you have a real notice all things considered little trips a little leaks here and there and so we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time be up to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nDr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium any of them is excellent

have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or even even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't it amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia\nWhere she was having pain and just about every join her body being hernia could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough but she was the one who took a week of ah the formula ... formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends\nSo that is amazing and when I use is what they're professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles and real relaxed shape\nThe really wouldn't think that to such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition it's greatly changed and add to that the medication as\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium museum in the system well the very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body is experiencing because his decision and many of them it's also blocking further absorption\nDoes and it's so it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you

missed just keeps getting better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to

so that number to call is one eight hundred eight two three\nEight eight five seven I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight five seven\nCould just tuned in we're talking with Dr Michael ... about stress and the negative effects that everyday stress has on your body whether it's job stress financial stress family stress any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body and Dr ... you were talking about how your ... formula\nCan help us in this battle against stress and I guess this is something\nEveryone should be aware of whether you're twenty four or Ninety four\nI've used it for many many years as as a younger person and I'm Eighteen [laughter] I use it then it definitely helps me sleep better it helps control the stresses that work in the world and many people will just be amazed how this actually works\nBecause our formula had a chemical reaction occurred before you actually ingested mhm Mac is treated off it doesn't get lodged in your system\nAnd so what happened is that when people drink the ... it's like an infusion into your body is like like compress it and so people who are paying they take the ... the calcium and he didn't get into the muscles and it starts to relax it\nDr figures you talked earlier about how stress affects your energy and I'd like you are to elaborate a little bit more on that subject if you would I mean the stress really affect our energy level\nGood question because energy like the biggest thing right now like people chronic fatigue syndrome PMS fiber my wife and people out and that's the key low energy is a lot of it's caught by paying\nFeeling old your joints don't move well this kind of wife's you out it drains your energy and then they never get tired and you go to sleep you got for it you don't\nKnow I'm telling you like common scenarios total lack of calcium and magnesium in your system when you have the comics and the first thing that happened you take it twenty minutes before you go to bed ... good night sleep and wake up feeling refreshed energy comes back\nIs killing me safe I mean you're telling us how powerful ... and I'm just wondering if you can ever take too much or if it's safe to take if you're already on a ... any supplements or medications\nComics is never ever been shown to interact with any medication okay it's a hundred percent natural state and you know formula doesn't contain sugar\nWhich isn't a lot of Calvin product wheat gluten lactose or anything that people are trying to avoid doesn't have any of that but you see the point is is that if you're a person has a diabetic and high blood pressure you had bypass surgery guess what\nYou are deficient you are deficient in the calcium and magnesium\nFactor Pincus unfortunately we're about out of time or any any parting thoughts I mean who who can really benefit from this\n[laughter] I Wish we had more time because this this product I'll tell you if you're over the age of thirty five [laughter] definitely be taking the count max formula\nJust daily preventative basis yeah but if you're someone who's more of a senior citizen or if you're someone who can't sleep well or you experienced a lot of muscle cramps a lot of akin in your body this is an absolute it's so simple but it controls most every function and your whole body you're someone\nBut failed all summer seeking asylum in Mexico most of them appear to be continuing the difficult track toward our borders\nSo what happens when and if they reach the U.S that's anybody's guess President Trump is promising to protect citizens from what some describe as an invasion\nJohnson Iraq is senior editor of the stream he's been monitoring the migration and he spoke with say will host Dennis prayer\nYou makes a point there are given that they're fleeing theoretically the persecution this may be a first in history where the country are fleeing persecution from you march with their flag\nRight right I I said I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt to gracefully turned back Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't waving Nazi flags and singing German nationalist songs and talking about how they were going to transform or England the U.S in the U.S in Germany the image I mean\nThat the people are mixing up the Jewish refugees from Germany with the German American button you know these people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by the government's they're\nThey're just living in kinda crappy countries\nYou know and those countries are crappy for a reason uh for historical and cultural and political reasons because they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad to tour a political culture from Spain whereas we inherited a kind of an\nAnti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England and\nAs a result they have more government than worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things there's a great\nLatin American economists her ... her and I think his name is turn on the court or a ... I think it's ...\nSoto\nThis photo and he said if you enforce property rights for the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from ... from drug lords\nLatin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it\nThey were fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people even if they they come in and start working their kids will grow up probably at public assistance large percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a whole honey pot full of benefits from the government\nSo why don't you think is going to happen when they reach the American border\nWell my hope is that we will have the U.S military lined up and choking off the entire border and I think President Trump should to ... he's already said this is a national emergency he should start using a defensive funds\nTo start constructing the wall\nYou ought to lay the he ought to lay the cornerstone of the wall gold plated with the big tea on it\nAnd start building the wall let Congress scream and yell blood judges scream and yell he should for their court orders and continue to use as authorities commander in chief to seal the border and you and take money away from gardening Afghanistan's border if necessary to guard at the United states is border\nThat's what we elected him for we didn't like Jeb Bush we didn't elect Nikki Haley we elected Donald Trump because we wanted to put America First before him he global policemen you know charity begins at home and is a crucial point I think\nBecause people feel a sense of mall moral ambivalence all\nThese people they just want to improve their lives okay first of all that is true of half the world\nIf you are going to say that you if you pick up and Honduras and say this sucks I'm outta here I'm going to the U. S. um if that is enough to get you went to the U. S. gets what most of the Islamic world would like to come to virtually everyone in China would like to come I bet Bangladesh Pakistan you could see the world in the United states and\nOur welfare system will be bankrupt within you know\nThirty six hours but hey at least we feel good about ourselves as we you know starved to death and watch the civil war overwhelm our country and turn it into it what I call Akaka Stan like so many other parts of the world but what about the mall argument\nI think we should see our country as a larger extension of our private homes if ... if somebody bags on your door and says he's homeless and demands to live in your living room you have the right to shut the door and use whatever forces required\nTo stop someone from staying in your house and eating your food against your will the exact same thing occurs applies to us as a country he's our country a common home that we work on and we improve and we leave to our children were grateful our grandparents we lead to our children we judiciously accept new commerce or something to offer\nOr are we just on a giant refugee camp like the ones we see you know in Turkey and Jordan where anybody who shows up you have to take him in and you put them on the same girl and given the same uniform and they and they gather around the same trash is you know trash\nCans with a fire is that the future of America\nTo me politically gonna happen presumably right before the incredibly important Russia will look right and I I I I worry given the owner bias of\nThe media that we will just have a video after video and photo after photo of some American either military person or ice personal border guard up pushing some mom with the baby\nAnd then uh it's it's it seems to me the when the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets a George Soros funded attorney\nYou know that's not to forgive me job that's not the propaganda war that swimming the war I agree but the propaganda war you know me I I think one of those ... let me let me just breaking point it seems to me that\nThey win if they get in and the women so you don't get it and I don't know because if they are good I Hope you're right I Know a little toys I you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness if he came and then Republicans across the country we just our hearts saying we realized the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIt even Donald Trump can't say no to something this ludicrous and politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress turn\nOut I I agree with you I agree with you I just I agree with you I'm I think\nIf she's not dance term it's\nEasier to learn that that will mean in picture in pictorial form that they will be fights between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us because I think people see that this is an invasion they can see it the people who are going to cry because a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back those people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out\nFor its war and otherwise going to turn out to the national impeachment referendum the less space has already fanatical they've got their their anti hurts ready they're ready to go to the polls they've got their dead people registered to vote does not left his all ready at its maximum frenzy\nAnd hysteria they've maxed out what the Kavanaugh hearings did was wake up the Republican base and wake up the patriotic Americans who say wait a minute they're just they're threatening our system of government the destroying an orange that justice oh and now they're bringing in case the doors to transform country demographically by the thousands\nAnd thousands and thousands of no\nNew to John already dot com for the rest of that interview and sign up for the pond cast messed up talk radio every day\nMid week a cluster of bomb scares were reporting to the offices in the homes of a number of Democrats among them George Soros Hillary Clinton and president bronco on you and disgusted with Texas Senator Ted Cruz as you hear in the interview he was learning when we're in China's which is why I'm here today but enough about that enjoy the segment\nWith a Senator Cruz talk to me a little bit about these nine a suspicious packages which was a real bomb the president's condemned the vice presidents that Rod Rosenstein I'm sure you're going to condemn it\nBut the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy it's either some not in a basement or it's a hostile power messing with our election\nBut what do you make can be attempt to blame Trump\nI look at it the media dealing with the media does which which is any any narrative that they can twist against Trump will do so and this is terrible I mean this is terrorism and whoever the terrorist is ... needs to be cost you need to prosecute a nice to be put in jail for a long long time\nAnd a and stuff but if that'll happen you know it's interesting you remember some months ago uh we we had the bomber in Austin\nA that was set off bombs throughout all stood and and I met with the the ATF both the FBI or leading the task force at the end of the federal law enforcement had tremendous resources to put\nA to bear it to track him down in terms of the components of the bomb I Know there I'm sure they're analyzing all of those now would catch this guy behind bars but but it is long violence is always role\nOr wherever it occurs on the political spectrum light you know we saw tragically a year ago a phrase gunman coming to Washington DC\nDoesn't mean that the voter ID laws weren't racists

often true and the mob talking point what is more true\nPretty much every English language publication it except for the New Yorker you know it it's not like I [noise] I was a um an ambitious donor or a failure but I I sometimes wonder how much more successful I Would have been if I hadn't\nBeen soaked in marijuana the whole time and I certainly would have a you know live my life is more integrity and getting carried out by a my business affairs with what made it more efficiently and I also just would have been able to devote more time to my family\nAnd how long how long have you been sober\nMy one year anniversary is November eleventh\nAnd what advantages do you see now the chair and non smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of or go to want to buy because\nIn some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I Would you know I wrote almost all my book I all the time and I I Can't although in retrospect there there's a lot of there are a lot of scenes and the novels that are about getting caught I think there'll be fewer of those but you know it it it helped me come up with certain flights fancy indecent jokes\nAnd they were the creative stimulant in some ways\nBut uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative\nSince I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends I feel like my life is in order professionally in a way that it wasn't it's not as much chaos and I'm and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows\nThat it's happening when I was using marijuana so I'm not having the melt down that would characterize sort of my my addiction cycle\n[noise] yeah one thing you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years does your wife ever share your enthusiasm for ah read\nNo and in fact she says the opposite now she she has no interest in it at all\nUm and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem I Would just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know 'cause the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive in some ways it's considered a health food um and so I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism in my family\nUm and obviously have the addiction gene I just did it it just didn't register with me um maybe it should have you know they've always ducking behind the dumpster

didn't see it she did and she she was so grateful when I finally made the decision to quit\nYou know you use the figures in your in your piece that I think they're generally accepted figures from the journal of the American Medical Association and based on studies done in a number of countries they suggest that uh some nine percent of people whoever use marijuana\nEnd up getting addicted\nAnd Seventeen percent of people use marijuana is teenagers\nDid you first used to wait as a teenager\nWhen I was a teenager let's just you know the Nineteen eighties I was I was sort of a a\nGo getter do

better that the room and stuffy then you end up with something I mean even if it's not a ghost raccoons pretty scary guys so I'm going to that's how we're going to close our vacation vault for this this week but uh I just wanted to share that funny little story with you because\nBoy these things can happen while you're traveling so\nThose are all things that really help you get over the hump of getting started get over your excuses of getting started because it's the first Fifteen minutes that's the hardest\nSo I just want to make sure everybody has these tools so that they don't say oh I Can't go it's too dark I Can't go and scared I Can't go the neighbor's dog about again no [laughter] you get out there All right so now let's talk about reasons you should plan a rest day on your next vacation\nWhether you're planning to travel to haunted house in Arizona or out of state or you're planning another type of vacation if you're going for more than just a few days it's important to have a day where you do nothing\nLike Winnie the Pooh says I Do nothing all the time\nAnd it's the calculator [noise] All right so your body needs rest you\nYou're totally exhausted many times from work and you don't usually want to go hiking for six days straight you know or running you know or\nKayaking or whatever you're doing and venturing you know you need to have a built in day to relax and we often forget that it's okay to cut ourselves some slack and take a vacation that actually involves arrest\nRather than forcing a bunch of activities into a short period of time yes your time is expensive but your health\nAnd not having it can be extremely expensive too\n[noise] so when you finally have an opportunity to take a vacation it can be almost impossible to get off the treadmill you know if you if you will so giving yourself a day to relax it's critical and rejuvenate and revitalize your body in doing so you'll actually be able to appreciate and enjoy the experience a lot more\nSo traveling is not easy as well and it's easy to appreciate vacation when you're looking at beautiful pictures of paradise on line however what most people don't talk about is how hard it can be to plan one\nYes it is if you are the two are director of your family or friends it is very difficult at times to keep everybody on track and moving and picking dates and times and All right so but picking a date and making sure it works with your schedule and finding all these destinations to go to in budgeting for the trip\nLooking for lodging rental car buying plane tickets so the list goes on and on and on\nAnd then once you've actually put the effort into planning a trip you have to actually travel [laughter]\nCramming yourself into the middle seat of an airplane on a long flight or traveling through various time zones driving several hundred miles especially when it's unexpected in your flight gets canceled um can take a toll on your body\n[noise] allow and allowing yourself at least a day to adjust\nTo the changing pace and environment will refresher mindset and give your body a much needed break so kick your feet up hanged by the pool read a book or check out a local cafe keep it low key and relax at least for one day you're like my rhyme [laughter]\nAll right now you won't miss out on anything when taking a day to relax to try to stay away from social media so I have\nAn idea andme our family that's called fun not phones and it's basically extends to the eye pad as well it's easy to get caught up in what other people are doing and have a burning desire to experience what they did\nKeep in mind social media is just a snapshot of someone's life or experience you may think you're getting the full picture\nBut what you're actually seeing is a glimpse of a fragment of reality the person you're living vicariously through probably took more time to relax and you think but it's only sharing daily cliff diving excursions because there are a lot more interesting than a photo them reading a book\n[laughter] although you do see some photos on the beach with a little bit of a book so you need to actively\nYou know light of I'm Sorry\nNot worry about uh the fear of missing out I guess that's called ... for the young people\nYou may think that you're going to miss out on something lights changing by taking a day off from your adventure when in fact you have something to gain an authentic experience to exploring a local coffee shop or getting familiar with your hotel pool\nAre just as valid of travel experiences hiking around the city and touring every\nAnd mark and museum I Know there is somebody in your family that does that it's like no no no we have\nFifteen more things to see let's move let's move people so uh that tends to be me and I do have to be told we have to slow down we need a little break and frankly that is one of the reasons on that show that I have incorporated a lot of coffee shops and bookstores used bookstores because you know buying\nRetail is against by religion by getting into the used book store and get a cup of coffee and the kids the juice and everybody just takes them time to reconnect and read it's awesome and if it's time for the pool that's awesome to okay\nSo an authentic experience means truly immersing yourself in an experience\nLet's say it's your first time traveling to the destination and you spent months scouring the Web to find all of the must see locations pretty soon you're less climbs to twenty must see things now you're up against the deadline stressful\nThat's not really vacationing that's working chances are you are decided you decided to travel to experience something new and live on a new schedule\nSo be free from time constraints don't send your vacation Boston yourself around again I'm guilty of this\nRather than creating a list of twenty must do adventures narrow it down and you know experience each moment slow down you know save or to the lemonade and or the coffee and allow your self to take it all in so All right\nLet's see here now we're gonna talk about one thing that is super important that most people forget\nThis shall we talk a lot about going to places that you can reach by car and there is a reason for that number one spend American number two\nYou know white family time in the car is really really nice bonding time nobody spent time around the fireplace anymore even lock your family and friends and a car and get to know them for real\nBut you know travel pillows are super important as well because again if you're not getting sleep and utilizing that time pretty well\nUh you know you can be tired and grouchy and it won't be as fond of a family experience so whether it's on a plane bus boat ride or a road trip in a car if the conditions are right you might want to get comfortable and snooze through the trip\nSo cozying up in a cramped you know economy the are up against another traveler on a train or bus\nCould leave you feeling that a nap or even a cat naps impossible however with the night the write travel pillow you might change your mind [noise]\nThe market for travel pillows has expanded in innovation presenting

other stuff to\nWash our talked about the effort of the left to blame these would be bombings on President Trump because the left and the media and the Democrats hate him\nIn this segment I Want to talk about what a great job in the ... a ... at the end of the other our asked me to do that what is it you're done that's so good I think he didn't think there was anything but I Want to talk about what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office\nI said for months now that I care less about what he says and much more in what he does\nHis tweets are not always helped him and he's in my opinion is after many people who shouldn't\nAnd engaged with people beneath his position to his detriment I I play tennis a lot and uh when uh sometimes on the court people come to know who I Am and they try to get my vote I just don't answer them off and I am I getting paid for this book and paid I'm not answering your guts\nBut he talks and you know get some debates with people who shouldn't\nBut I never expected him to govern in such a conservative way he's far surpass my expectations for him I must admit he was not my first choice in the primary season I was actually a Ted Cruz delicate in my initial judgment I thought Trump was only better than John ...\nWhich isn't saying much cause ... will be a Democrat\nBut I have long submitted that far from being the worst choice or the second worst choice for president he may have very well being the only Republican that could have one\nIn fact I've wondered a lot of the callers suggested this last hour if profit Providence was involved in this election after off a bomb had done you know talking about radically changing our country it might have very well been too late to turn America\nHillary had one and I don't know if you know Bruce ... he ran against Barbara Boxer the but when she ran for the U.S Senate and I asked him if he thought God was involved in the founding of our country and the answer of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost everything right\nAnd what is it also Providence I Wonder that we got George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most\nYou'd get no argument from me about gods involvement and now I think we got Donald J Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most yesterday one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election of course that doesn't matter much either considering we train against and\nRemember many of us thought he would be very satisfy we would be very satisfied if President Trump will just nominate conservative judges especially for the Supreme Court so I thought were way ahead of the game when he point the judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court\nBut he didn't stop there\nLet me go through the list that the caller wanted ending the Obamacare mandate opening up the Keystone Pipeline than Anwar reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy\nA significant tax cut I don't know why and he talks about it but not enough Republicans do lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms moving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords withdrawing from the disastrous Iranian deal\nMeeting with Kim all young to possibly produce the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\nGetting American remains he's already done that returned from North Korea\nMaking sure our borders means something yeah color from last hour who knows what people are up to there just isn't it a coincidence that the coming right around the election and a mom who knows how they're getting paid how they're supporting themselves yeah I've heard local church groups and so on\nBut this isn't just organized spontaneously\nAnd of course the naming of his second Supreme Court a choice a few weeks ago and he was successful another I'm Brett Kavanaugh the list goes on and on and the American people love that he is not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who spinning and spinning and spinning that's where we are talking about last hour and are afraid to say what they are really thinking you don't have that problem\nYou can never say that about President Trump he may say too much but he never has two little he is one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime he has done a great job and most of the American people get it but it doesn't matter to the left\nOr the Democrats or their comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left is the Democrats and liberal listeners so maybe I'll watch for this\nIf the presidential election were held today\nPresident Trump would easily be reelected he's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nYou are dreaming if you think he's going to be defeated you a failed to get rid of him but not for lack of trying you started the day he won\nActually we now know that they start their resistance again him against the much before election day but was election day came they couldn't believe that this so called bumbling fools had won\nSo bumbling but he's still one no matter what the upper lead of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed he won\nAnd I was almost I mentioned this last hour in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania\nWhich always seemed like a Republicans fool's gold you know we're always going to win a Romney who's gonna win ... W was going to win it but not only did he win but there despite their best efforts he want he still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the color persecution\nOr is that prosecution got to think about that we was uh which one is that no matter the hostile media no matter the never Trump spurs no matter all the elites and the swamp President Trump is still here which never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor point to\nAnd including the best efforts in terms of the bomber he won't work even though they won accused him of being responsible for the bomber he's accused of everything and anything they can come up with he still hear\nIt never should have happened with the more investigation if not for Jeff Sessions as an aside I'm disappointed you never recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nBut typically politicians talk to our adversaries re did it she talked to the Russians remember the reset button remember Obama saying that he was reelected that he would take care of it and you know they work work it out and he promised that off Mike\nAnd a bakery and I'm Seventy four and um go working uh-huh I'm a grandmother or grandchildren and I believe in shut the wall built that wall and I will work for that\nYes you might be you might be interested I had a caller another show another network\nAnd his whole argument was walls never work in the long run and I said to him first so I don't even accept your ... your ...\nWhat are you in if it was true that they don't work in the long run they sure as heck work in the short run tell that to the Israelis who are being attacked by Hamas and Hezbollah you know when they try to get over and that they've knife to kids in the middle of the night\nUp to tell that to anybody who you know is worried about what could happen to them tell up to people with the Berlin Wall right it sure worked there whether it was on our side so you know when we got rid of it or not ending we gave them freedom of course they try to use the Berlin Wall against us but that was not to to keep people\nFrom coming in and that was from TB people from leaving\nWants to work in the short run\nAnd it's important it's not the only thing we need to do as you say but it's one of the resources we need to have taken place just sink with the caravan I don't even know some colors ... what are we going to do right excuse me\nCan I get tired of that shot a caravan what me another data yeah yeah yeah that's right the language is really not a hundred million kind\nYep you're right it's not a ...\nPre planned and people are suffering because of the ... the money that the older one batter and money and destroy Crump they come in the country you don't know who's going to get murder who's going to get chopped up recording it killed what how to get by according to people wake up\nYour hair I have an alarm or my hand everything has a lawn cutting all the politicians [laughter]\nYup why that arise from Ben in the Hollywood campaign out there we protect our country\nExactly exactly I I was going to talk about illegal immigration will probably save it for money a Monday when I shall incidental ... but you're absolutely right we would never let anybody would know documents come into our house and say you were undocumented right to that would be illegal we'd never let anybody go to a bank account and said to the bank I just don't have a right documents but give me the money\nGive me marks money no one would ever allow that which you allow people to recognize\nWater's got four hundred million dollar home she got her and she's got a laundry got everything after a short trip on border come to you got to have her second\nI ...

freebie I'm my spring ...\nDressed as a model for Halloween of less creative I I like to do but I got to get my bullet [laughter]\nSo that's the way we can talk to my window yeah there you go if you really know how great the my pillow is why not give them for every one you know oh I got it if you really have a ... give me one mark I should go let me know that you did it and have it spent I'll give you my address and will solve a lot of problems at once\nIf you're looking for a great night sleep now is the first perfect time to do it as I said call eight hundred eight nine oh one aid for three years the promo code Larry we'll go to my pillow dot com\nForm a call ... ... who will go on a call ... ... ...\n... ... yeah well ...\nAlso ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... that promote a book called them all over the all ...\nAll all recall God will ... ... ... ...\n... ... lower and lower the Americans are going to the polls on ... on the world though who will ... ... ... ... ... will go on the job ...\nWe'll ... we'll call them ... recall lawful shown over the walls to use ... mobile ... shows to a mobile\nYou said a very well Richard let's go you know Claire Wisconsin to Ken Ken you're on with mark\n[noise] um yes I voted for President Trump simply because he said he was going to during the ... ... if you were a Democrat or Republican you were banned the restraint and you're you're out and make America great again and\nIt didn't matter what side you're on but if you were bad and all these people that are against them or one in like little dogs between are like\nThat and I think the Democrats overplay their hand let's go to Joe in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania you're on with mark\nHey mark I just don't understand I Can't get this through my head why Hillary Clinton isn't being held accountable when she opened recalled for civil unrest last week um until the Democrats are back in power when you do that and you have a national or international audience\nGo wackos or want to come out of the woodwork and she should be held accountable for making that statement\nYeah but Joe she's on the other side she can say anything she wants\n[laughter] right [laughter] I you know what it means the other day as far as that tire rant concern out how to ruminate all media coverage say hey we're going to let them in the ... the registered Republican\nIn that delivered [laughter] you're not hearing anything about the cabin anymore yeah you're a great\nIn fact a ... you know I I agree with you if there was any thought that illegal immigrants who are voting for Republicans in huge numbers certainly even in a majority\nWhy do I have a strong feeling that the Democrats would be against illegal immigration like they were four years right there are a lot of clips from bite into a Clinton or to Hillary Clinton all of them are against illegal immigration but now it's convenient and they need the vote by the way\nIf they lose a minority votes in the proportions that Trump seems capable of doing the words they Democrats are always get what Ninety Ninety five percent of voting Obama's case if it ever starts to go the other way they are in huge trouble\nBecause that's what they count on that count as I mentioned the store with large month that they cannot just wrote here's what we do we vote for the Democrats they care about the poor the fact that they have and help the poor the fact that if you look at the school system I teach part time and see what it's like in inner cities none of that seems to matter their immune to that\nBecause what they have on their side they have to press they have the media they have the schools certainly have the colleges they have so many things going for them that it's no wonder that the Democrats get so many votes from minorities because they don't know\nThey don't know that a lot of the stuff they've been hearing and listening to all these years has done them no good\nThey told over and over again Republicans are evil they hate you for big business yeah we didn't even get the big business and all my time\nMost of the rich people in this country voted for Obama and certainly it wasn't a Trump vote for Hillary Clinton so this idea that Republicans for for of our big business and the Democrats and the poor and the people who and we had a court challenge me on that or for the poor and and the disenfranchised each not true\nAnd that's what President Trump appeals to\nAnd people because one of the things that gets him in trouble like everything in life there's a balance theory also helps them they know he says what he's thinking there is none of this being and all the stuff the politicians usually do would you say one thing and then lose another way to do with a different way\nThis guy is different he's surprised me he says some things on Twitter and do you know ... some things you wish you wouldn't\nBut the American people are thrilled that they finally got a president that standing up for the United states of America finally got a president that understands that free enterprise is the thing that builds everybody\nThis is what makes America special it was in exceptional experiment in the course of human history and Paul Donald Trump in his own way get so let me know what you're saying had eight eight eight nine seven one sage Marcus\nAll through all of

eight seven seven three one two three eighty one one Seventy seven three one two three eighty one well now I have a question for you ...\nI think it's a question I I Will be the first on radio at least ask but before I ask it I Want to look at this here with you or word right scoop [noise] her body Brian has a list of all the crimes committed\nBy the domestic terrorist I'm not talking about ... and the bernadine darn I'm not talking about the FAA all and they got all the parts from Clinton and so we are no no I'm Talking about this guy\nAnd boy I'll tell you what\nHe committed a felony in Nineteen Ninety One domestic violence of Nineteen Ninety four numerous parking violations another felony and two thousand for this guy was drunk court more parking violations or had a foreclosure let's see uh [noise]\nLike criminal traffic violation other traffic traffic traffic has on and on the other third degree felony and other parking violation misdemeanors recently twenty ... how's this guy not in prison he's committed multiple felonies but here's a bigger question for you\nLadies and gentlemen and this was sent to me by buddy of mine the New York\nTimes and other news outlets keep referring to this guy is a registered Republican right\nBut he's previously been convicted of selling these according to their same store and these other stores\nSo he should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote in Florida\nYou know the Democrats and the blue states in the blue cities they keep pushing for the rights of felons to vote after they've served their time you've heard it over and over again you're Gillum mentioned it and one of the debates summer even pushing for the ride of felons to vote while they're in prison\n\nBut let's talk about the facts here it's Florida\nHe should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote and it could not be restored until and unless he applied to the Florida clemency board and was approved\nFlorida is one of the states that does not does not automatically restore the writer felons to vote when they get out of prison even though it's who might by the way it goes so left but a referendum on the upcoming November ballot Barney of honor nice to do exactly that\nSo unless he had his right to vote restored he can't be a registered Republican quote unquote so I Would ask the news media out there the New York slime constipated news network MSL us day all of you\n\nHow did he become a registered Republican when I was supposed to be stripped off the off the rolls\n\nAround once again you don't automatically\nRestore the ride of Ellen's devote when they get out of prison in Florida even though the left has a ballot measure right now for this election to do exactly that so that's not job would have had as right to vote restored Yvette past\nHe's a registered Republican\nHow do they become or how did he stay a registered Republican given the multiple felonies\nHow\nIt can be restored and the lesson utterly apply to the Florida clemency board unless it was approved is that what happened are there any media outlet media outlets that want to check it out I'm curious and by the way\nI Want to thank fabulous law enforcement local state and federal fabulous law enforcement the men and women of local law enforcement the men and women of state law enforcement the\nMen and women of federal law and for it I'm not talking about like how many times you know what I mean I'm Talking about the men and women of local state federal law enforcement that my last trashes every damn day\nThat the left that taxes racist as begging every day\nAnd yet here we had Democrats targeted at local state and federal law enforcement people\nWere fabulous they moved quickly they moved effectively\nAnd they track this guy down what forty eight hours or so give or take\n\nBut don't worry and another week or two nobody trash in law enforcement like they always do like they always do\n\nAnd I wonder if this criminal justice reform stuff\n\nCriminal justice reform they called us how the hell that this guy get out of prison\nHe's got a criminal record not as long as his right arm as long as there's less than his right arm misdemeanors felonies\n\nHow did he get out and that's just the foreign criminal justice reform we spend way too much time worrying about convicted felons or people who played the felonies and not enough time worrying about victims of crimes\nWe've sped away too much time worrying about illegal aliens rather than American citizens we spend too much time worrying about illegal alien children dreamers rather than an American citizen children\n\nWe allowed to talk about these things I mean I insist on talking about these things now the president has correctly pointed out\nI Know he's an avid listener to this program and I greatly appreciate it\nThat the media really of lead the way with the rhetoric\nWas references the Hitler with the references to racism anyone they disagree with on the left and that includes a media of course that's how they frame the issues get ...\n\nAnd there'd been a number of very smart articles written today and yesterday pointing out hey look\nPolitical rhetoric even bad political rhetoric\nDoesn't justify doesn't explain what a nut job like this does and did\n\nIt simply does not I just gave you a laundry list of the crimes that he committed\n\nOften to and through twenty fourteen Donald Trump wasn't even running for president up and to and through twenty four Cheney committed multiple felonies by that multiple felonies he was already radicalized\n\nHit any Donald Trump or anybody else to push him over the edge you was already over there which\n\nHe started committing crimes at least from the public record since Nineteen Ninety One all the way through twenty fourteen\n\nSays nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing whatsoever\n\nBut the left the media the Democrats have a quote unquote registered Republican\n\nAnd Donald Trump and he's driving around with what Trump and Pence on his pictures of them and their names on his on his van\nSo they make this connection there is no connection\nThere is no connection whatsoever\nThe media trash in law enforcement the Democrats trashing law enforcement that left trashing law enforcement and now I think we can see why we need a law enforcement\n\nExcusing antifa excusing black lives matter ignoring Obama's relationship with actual domestic terrorists bill layers and burning door and among others\nPresident Trump has no relationship it never did what the actual domestic terrorists underground student terrorists who are actively involved the bombings\n\nNot Donald Trump has not partnered terrorists members of the FAA all what the Puerto Rican separate his organization you can lay that on Clinton and Obama\nTrump ever did that Trump or even suggested that Trump has been supporting the law enforcement that same law enforcement that just track down this job\n\nThat law enforcement\nBut I asked the question again maybe as a registered Republican this not job but how did he become a registered Republican how did he not lose his uh his right to vote he's not even supposed to be on the voting list or maybe a maybe there was an effort to remove them from the voting less but some left wing group said it was voter suppression\nI don't know I'd like to know\nBut you had a real mix of things here that's very fascinating to me I'll be right back [noise] money [noise]\nKnow\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former Ford Lincoln and mercury owners are less ... can receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to call it an air bags and their vehicles\n\nThe way he was ... or the perpetrator before he was caught was portrayed\nThe insinuation from Schumer and pillows for the insinuation from CNN and MSNBC was there was a direct line between Trump and his rhetoric\nAnd whoever was doing this that was the insinuation that pushed him over the patch and that this is what causes it sort of know it doesn't but has multiple felonies in his past the guy threatened to use a bomb and two thousand two\n\nThat's pretty ah\nLong before Donald Trump even started with the idea of running for president United States he was arrested in two thousand two according to the Associated Press on charges of threatening to throw place projector discharge any destructive device\n\nAnd as pointed out in the Washington Examiner he made the bomb threat because he was angry at a party utility worker St people do not make these threats\n\nAnd commit these other felonies and I suppose would be governor Andrew Gillum medical you answer Andrew Gillum\n\nWhat say well the police should pull out guns are tasers or Billy\nClubs or anything of this or no no no they should figure out how to make the guy he'll be more you know community relations my community relations\nI tell you what\nI'd like to know a hell of a lot more about the situation I really would not from a conspiracy perspective or anything else I just want to know more of the facts\n\nAnd I'm sure now that the New York slime so washing compost the constipated news network MSL honesty and all the rest of them are working feverishly to figure out how he became a registered Republican or retain that and I think the New York times is obligated since it was the first report is to tell us how\nWas because Florida\nIs not allowed to clear up it's a voter rolls because of all the left wing are suing is because um [noise]\nPeople on the Florida clemency board game as registration what exactly are we going to rethink this idea that that one

specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but\nYou know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiencies are not like I'm going to have a water main break into where you have a real notice all things considered little trips a little leaks here and there and so we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time you up to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] Dr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium any of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles museum actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take the comments formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I heard he ate at a

gone but I I drank it over ten day period it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or even even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady\nWas suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body being hernia could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I are the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just to the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of uh the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends\nSo that is amazing and when I use is with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles and real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact or the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years of the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium museum in the system well very drugs that are training the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fish and in many of them\nIs also blocking further absorption\nDoes and it's it's really it's really a rat race or sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah nothing to lose\nBy folks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred eighty two three

remember you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free so that number to call is one\nEight hundred eight two three eight eight five seven oh give it to you again it's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight five seven\nDay just tuned in we're talking with Dr Michael Pincus about stress and the negative effects that everyday stress has on your body whether it's job stress financial stress family stress any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body and Dr ... ... you were talking about how your ... formula\nCan help us in this battle against stress\nAnd I guess this is something everyone should be aware of whether you're twenty four or Ninety four\nI've used it for many many years as as a younger person and I'm Eighteen [laughter] so I use it then it definitely helps me sleep better it helps control the stress of the work in the world and many people just be amazed how this actually work\nBecause our formula have a chemical reaction occurred before you actually ingested mhm Mac is treated off it doesn't get lodged in your system and so what happens is that when people drink the Mac\nIt's like an infusion into your body is like like compress it and so people who aren't paying they take the comments the calcium and he didn't get into the muscles and it starts to relax it\nDr biggest you talked earlier about how stress affects your energy and I'd like you are to elaborate a little bit more on that subject if you would I mean the stress really affect our energy levels\nQuestion 'cause like the biggest thing right now like people chronic fatigue syndrome PMS fibromyalgia\nLike white people and that's the key to low energy is a lot of it's caught by paying feeling old your joints don't well it's kinda wife's you out it drains your energy and then and then you get tired and you go to sleep I guess what you don't\nKnow I'm telling you like common scenarios total lack of calcium and magnesium in your system when you have the comics and the first thing that happened you take it twenty minutes before you go to bed mhm good night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed energy coming back\nIs comic safe I mean you're telling us how powerful ... and I'm just wondering if you can ever take too much or if it's safe to take if you're already on a ... any supplements or medications\nComics is never ever been shown to interact with any medication okay it's a hundred percent natural state and you know formula doesn't contain sugar\nWhich isn't a lot of calcium product wheat gluten lactose or anything that people are trying to avoid doesn't have any of that but you see the point is is that if you're a person at a diabetic and high blood pressure you had a bypass surgery guess what\nYou are deficient you are deficient in the calcium and magnesium\n... unfortunately we're about out of time or any any parting thoughts I mean who who can really benefit from this\n[laughter] I Wish we had more time because this this product I'll tell you if you're over the age of thirty five [laughter] definitely be taking the comebacks formula\nJust daily preventative basis yeah but if you're someone who's more of a senior citizen or someone who can't sleep well or your experience do a lot of muscle cramps a lot of it can and your body this is an absolute it's so simple but it controls most every function and your whole body you're someone\nThat's been diagnosed with a condition your blood pressure medications always saying how Macs is so unique it's something that I urge you to try and help you\nTime you do it to me when you catch my program each weekday morning lives six AM and an east coast and on demand twenty four seven\nLearn more you you're a dot com\nNovember midterms are scarcely more than two weeks away\nMail in ballots are already blowing in early voting underway Congress was in the crosshairs of the electorate will Democrats get power back in the house and what about the Senate ... actually gain seats two three four several current democratic streets or in the spotlight\nGoes in North Dakota Indiana Florida but none more than Missouri is incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill wants to hang on to her seat against her variable challenger Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley my colleague Larry Elder spoke with James O'Keefe of project merit Josh\nThis time keeps investigative team do deep inside the McCaskill campaign we've got\nSome news biggest Claire McCaskill shots to respond to to our hidden camera investigation she attacked a video of course but she made a false statement in this state and she put out\nA she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John Paul II had fortunately embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct\nI had nothing to do with Josh ... never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved with this investigation\nAnd just for your listeners know our investigation McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that come up and McCaskill on a bottle policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that other staffers talking about banning semi automatic rifles and the capital herself was calling hidden camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that there would be gun ban of some type so the capitals now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only does the Stanford talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they talked about handguns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets in the Senate will vote with the so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there is a red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are moderate they're not left is they're they're they're moderate\nThe pro life pro gun Democrats ... thing in Missouri indoor than me slaying state so whether it's an aspiration exposure is is that in order to get elected in order to get elected\nYou have to lie to the people and that's what our staffers are saying anything moderates we'll just have to get over being lied to very devastating very powerful I mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because of the ball hitting\nUS Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling her a wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill response James okay\nWell it is some startling and Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently in betting on me and my campaign\nNice the attorney general in the same as he starts to be going after fried not participating in it [noise]\nSo um there was nothing there I think very up prime al my positions I made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment really telling about this is how how far they're willing to go too far in bed somebody in my campaign\n[noise] world first of all it didn't mean to fly categorically unequivocally falls\nJosh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I'd never met him and she didn't live on a local TV in Missouri Larry to what's going to happen next to this this rather than a candidate John always going to tell you that had nothing to do with it\nChicken at respond to that so I think we're we're achieving our goal of holding people accountable and I think that she's in a lose lose situation\nHurricane and ravaged the Florida Panhandle northward from the Gulf was horribly unpredictable and that does now passing thirty\nAnd all air force base near Panama City took a serious\nAnd it's one of the size of or a leader deaf twenty two fighter jets which they were concerned with our nation's fighting ability ought to be concerned about that I turn to a regular on my program Congressman Mike Gallagher of the house armed services committee offense experts in the marine corps intelligence veteran himself let's\nGet right down to it the danger zone\nHas receded according to I'm writing a real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seen see six districts will hurt Andy Barr Mike Bost Rodney Davis Brian Mast John Katko receipt and to save comfortable territory [noise] it's it's we're down to twenty to thirty districts that are competitive and\nVery sound pretty optimistic it on hold the house or Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party offices we have around my district in northeast Wisconsin we've seen in a surge in volunteers coming in people coming in that aren't necessarily party faithful to take up signs and ask what can I Do to help so I Do sense a slight\nMomentous shift I always thought this was going to be a nice that when we talk about control the house you know five seats one way or the other\nUh but also my understanding is that our we have real opportunities to pick up some seats from Democrats in Minnesota and other Democrats are pulling out\nOf a couple of states that look if you try to get our direction so again we got to run through that you have this you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down\nThe candidate quality and sort of the twenty to thirty states that we're talking about here\n[laughter] sorry let me talk to you about some defense or she was first of all the F twenty to ten dull a it's a murky picture I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt that bad but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe a things to sell technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment at why by the way we keep as twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell you trying to read through this and I'm looking forward to being back in session in November So we can ask questions of video deed figure out what exactly happened it seems like Seventeen twenty Jews are damaged I think ten of those are cats and the storm right at hangar\nBut no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus miles per hour winds and seven of the center of the Seventeen when Lester rated hangers\nI think it's important enough that no one thought this would be a four to five little working forty hours prior I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here on the planes are basic and do so that they can have access to the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want to budget that twenty two is going into super cruise over Kansas it's too disturbing to the local communities\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country so as best I can tell him talking to officials pocket experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be repaired but the problem here is the skin on the plane\nThere's a lot of radar absorbent material wham involved and the repairing and replacing could be very expensive\nAnd my understanding of the initial site survey suggests that the air frames appear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back on track but repairing the scans will be a very expensive proposition finally I just say coming to your question you know why we're so many their ground\nThis goes back really to the Obama administration decision to the program at two thousand nine factory gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on air force personnel and train maintain ers and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that show many were on the ground and the first place\nWith their engines pulled it because of the lack of spare parts and a lack\nOf train people to repair that\nOur president is doing the

[noise]\nSo Robert was a great general change our debt [noise]\nAbraham Lincoln\nHe couldn't be Robert ... he was going crazy I don't know if you know the answer but Robert Daly was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln gamma reason I can see\nThat one day\nIt was looking really mad and he just said\nYou hardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a

John Boehner I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the ... the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday what are the second offends me six a sufficient to the United states\nWell the question here is has turkey shared intelligent Turkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe the radio of from inside the conflicts showing who did what a mix of the nation you know they've got they've got the goods\nIf they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence got it buys who often work very closely with the Turks and that's one thing and if they haven't if they only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on us\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared\nReally All right now doesn't impact for example the war in Yemen this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses who's a Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTrying to confront these were sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome as being a necessary course correction middle aged\nI'm not sure they had any impact on me and rainy and all that I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish tennis whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a robot operator before the Saudis had begun to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nCan their arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it is an exotic story and read like a thriller ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long Democrat or a\nYeah I think we're trying to say before where it's going

their businesses and their insights and there are no out to help diversify the Saudi economy\nHe's gonna find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because

clean the whole area with soapy warm water just to make sure you get that residue off of there [noise] okay so\nNow we're going to talk about crayon marks on TV screens\nMany of you have children and chances are you have found crayon marks on walls appliances not to mention TV screens\nFor those of you aunts and uncles out there who babysit your children or grandmothers and grandfathers who haven't had them in a while and suddenly you have an art gallery on your walls or your TV and pray on there is a simple way of removing crayon drawings from your screen simply use WD forty\nI never would have thought of this but applying WD forty two a towel and holding it against the screen surface instead of spraying it directly on the unit is what's the key here\nYou know here's some things that you can do at least as far as a dog goes the pet safe spray shield animal deterrent it it detracts animals with a powerful ... percent and it helps and aggressive dog unlike pepper spray it has no negative side effects\nFor you or the dog but there's enough liquid in the canister just spray it ten foot stream for twelve seconds\nThe spray comes with a belt pocket clip making it easy to carry

with bears you want to be as big as possible scare them off you know\nSo it's that same concept to be as noisy and as big as bright as possible to attract attention and scare off\nI'm your attacker whether it be two or four legged okay so\nNext I Want to mention something\nThe latest road trip which I Will be talking about next week on\nThis show I went to ... Texas with my family and I ended up doing a long road trip through New Orleans and going up through Vicksburg this was this was our little fall break trips so\nThat was we were supposed to fly out of Dallas and our flight got cancelled by Expedia\nSo as you can tell I Am non plus about that but I had to rent a car last minute due to the hurricanes it's hurricane season and all of the flights got booked so I had to rent a car to drive back to our beautiful state of Arizona\nAnd it was the last minute things so you know in my case and in many of yours you know we're all we're all out getting out there and and doing stuff and in order to be safe to do those things it's important to pack an emergency car kit\nAnd the reason for that is so many things can happen just keep it if you even if you're flying\nTake it in a suitcase because you don't know if you will be driving home like I did last Sunday [laughter] Seventeen hours straight with my parents and the children it was ... imagine [laughter]\nYou go from flat Texas through New Mexico when we cross that Arizona border it was a huge cheer you know but the point is is that you need to make sure that you've packed this cat so\nHere's what needs to happen I\nGo in and you you can build your cars emergency preparedness preparedness kid by packing blankets and extra clothing and shoes so if you're traveling\nLike I did you already have the clothing and shoes but you can pack a blanket that'll little pack down something potentially nylon\nOr um you know but that has a little bit of warm to it but it has a little bit of um [noise] not natural fibers cause they typically won't pack down is tight so\nI'm polyester does really well for warmth and you can add um\nProtein bars and a favorite snack um as long as it's packaged you can bring that on the plane they don't care but they do care about liquid so um you know when you're when you're stopping make sure that you get some water and\nPack that away with your cat as well and leave it in the car so you'll also want to make sure you have a first aid kit in your luggage or in your car and has stock to\nBandages antiseptic gods and other basics\nSo this last trip we did was ah through you know Gulf Coast area up in ... Mississippi Louisiana\nI Will tell you you know many nights we we we had to stuff toilet paper in our ears ... imagine sleeping trying to sleep and you hear it and\nSo I said kids go get the toilet paper\n... piece of the toilet paper in our ears so we can get some rest we woke up a little bit in up so I Would suggest as well in this kid making sure that you have either drier sheets to get rid of the you know the bugs and as well as you know\nWhat do you call that calamine lotion [laughter]\nBecause the local shops you know in in this area don't seem to notice you know either they're immune to bug bites\nBut it's not super easy to find unless there's just a random Walgreens around there so if you're going in the southern states of the United states of any sort I Would say calamine lotion should be in your emergency kit as well\nSo also you're going to make sure you have\nRoads layers and um you know things it it very frankly you should also be checking to make sure that you have a spare tire if that\nIf your vehicle will fit like a donut tire 'em in a in a changing tire kit um [noise] as well in the car so if you're a rental car doesn't have that you can ask the rental car company for a kid um you know because some of these places are so remote\nI really don't know how long it would take triple A.\nOr one of your toe companies to get there you may want to try to get into a station where you can get to a hotel get to somewhere where you can rest and you're not on the side of the road waiting for hours for until company potentially with all of the mosquitoes [noise] so\nUm you know all of these things are super super important so that you have a a nicer trip\nUh like I said I learned after the first evening of bugs or what to do so I Would just say you really want to try to pack some of these things ahead um\nYou know and make sure that they're in your bag and ready to go so you know your road trip is is much more streamlined and successful [noise]\nAll right so you also want to have a cell phone and a charge or seizing call for help and stay in touch with your family you might also considered keeping your kid and in a backpack and keeps you need to lose lead the car and so my kids travel with backpacks I travel with her so\nThat goes with their stuff all the bottles of calamine and gold bond medicated cream\nAll right so let's see here\nNow travel mistakes as I mentioned I have had a few the bug thing was was definitely one of them I was not prepared for that so\nI have done a lot of traveling and I feel like in many respects though I I have the system down and so whether by train or by car it's still easy to make some mistakes and we're all susceptible to it it can be anything from choosing a destination to packing navigating maps\nThere is a list of a few more of a common travel mistakes here and you know\nJust do what you can and have them as my parents put it were making memories [laughter] so [laughter]\nThat's what it's about and sometimes\nWhen you have the ... news it's it's fun to talk about ... and laugh about afterwards but not in the middle of it but here in some ways to avoid some of these mistakes so trying to fit to many destinations into one trip I have actually done that as well\nUm and we had one of the days where I had not planned for the size of the drive a that we had\nSo we didn't get to do as much in the city that I had planned for and it's the there are travelers who actually have attempted to visit ten cities on a two week vacation to Europe\nIt sounds like fun but in theory it doesn't give you much time in each city as I mentioned before you get there you look around everybody get back in the car so there's a certain amount of time you'll spend flying or traveling on it in a car on a train\nAnd so the best thing to do is map out what your trip priorities are read opinions from other travelers about the minimum amount of recommended\nA time needed per city and planned rest days to alleviate the stress and get the Mossad they experience without being exhausted\nRemember you can always return if you don't fit it all in\nAnother little tiny tip what this is you know when you're doing a road trip that you're going to have a couple of long drives bring the neck pillows that you would bring on a plane because for the non drivers the if what is that the law of the carpets everybody to sleep and you don't want to wake up at the quick and your neck\nSo that helps as well so standing in long lines\nAt attractions is another aspect of a ... of a mistake you know you might be entertained and museum or Parker seeing such sites as the Eiffel Tower but waiting in line\nHas been ready to DC for politically correct I tend to dismiss learn the Larry Elder [noise]\n\nLarry over here that said from South syndrome unit bizarre\nWay down the Marines are welcome to the program because we got to kind of just a guaranteed\n[noise]\nCrippled eight nine seven one S.

could make it clear that was trillions now feel yeah right but thirty trillion would kick our national debt in into oblivion a national debt would be so big it'll bankrupt that should be a horrible horrible thing\nBut Dan Obamacare solve all our problems remember when Joe Biden said yeah it's a big deal I thought it solve all our problems\nWell I'll tell you what Obama said you can keep your doctor if you want to and that was a lie this one here\nYou can't keep Medicare Bernays plan replaces Medicare itself with Medicare for all the different kind of policy\nNot only that there is twenty two million Americans people who have Medicare Advantage plans which are run by private companies and they would eliminate all of them that would be an increase fishing is fish would hurt seniors especially and that's why a Mac is against Medicare for all\nWhen when you want to get a left wing persons drawn to tighten the Dan Weber ask him or her who's going to pay for it who's going to pay for that but he was going to pay for thirty two trillion dollars over ten years yeah\nThat's right and in addition to that you're going to have rationing\nPeople say oh well Canada and Great Britain have great plants\nEverywhere I should keep this number line twenty two weeks that's how long it takes for a major surgery and Canada\nAfter they examined you may take months for the you have been examined that now they say yes you need this major surgery twenty two weeks average wait a lot of those people cross over the border and they get their operations in America\nThan wherever is my guest founder and CEO of a Mac ... association of mature American citizens now Dana probably mangled this guy's name but I Know the father of the Canadian health care system in Canada is named Claude Gaston ... or something like that and he won that sounded it in Quebec\nAnd all the other provinces ultimately adopted it he still alive as far as I Know in his nineties and have come out and recently said\nThat I was wrong we should have had more competition I should not have outlawed private care and he pronounced the healthcare system Internet in Canada pretty much a failure\nYeah yeah and well we just gotta look socialize looking at a Cuba they don't even have\nA aspirin available in a local drugstores look at Venezuela they socialize the medical care thinking doctors running too much and now the poor people literally are dying and it's a shame socialism doesn't work because under socialism the individual mandate from nothing\nAnd I'm often asked people this question whenever I have a discussion about this Canada Great Britain they have a a socialized medicine Canada has a what I think Obama wants to have which is single payer in Great Britain has something very similar but when you take polls the majority of citizens in both Canada and Great Britain seem to like their system why is that\nBecause if they get a sniffle they can go into a local clinic than they were in a long time to go to a local call and I got to get taken care of and it won't be any money out of their pocket\nUntil they have a serious problem not only that the recovery race after cancer operations at the heart operations because of the way they rush medical care\nAs much less survival and Canada and Great Britain compared to the U.S was something depending on what type of cancer\nWhere somebody between twenty and thirty percent higher survival rates because it's not a machine like they have over there well you march in March out your number you know stop what is your relationship with the doctor it's horrible system or we don't need it and America\nMy guess is damn wherever founder and CEO of a macro association of mature American citizens and we only have about ... seconds left what ideas as a Mac ham on how to reduce costs of health care all\nWe got this free enterprise for example we have a bill in Congress now with mine co sponsors age are fifty eight fifty six listening to this so called the seven million people for free\nWe give doctors local doctors can take a simple tax deduction for treating a patient for free [noise]\nThat'll cost the government about fifty bucks for the tax deduction for the dog versus somebody on Medicaid who goes to the ER as a couple of testing costs a thousand dollars\nSo every time a person goes we estimate seven million people could be covered it will save billions on Medicaid and Medicare for the feds and for the state so that's what I was pushing\nThem wherever thank you very much for coming on founder and CEO of a Mac association of mature American citizens Dan thank you very much I appreciate it\nThank you God Bless God Bless\nMedicare for all forty thirty two trillion dollars over the course of ten years and when I was angry Ocasio Cortez was asked to pay for it she says well we're going to modernize things and and we're going to make things much more efficient don't you love it when someone who's never worked in health care\nHas all these ideas on how to make things more efficient because the people working in healthcare too stupid to figure it out we're going to have you were raised you're paid to Fifteen dollar

once again based on drugs for a reason\nLove and it's\nTown you can make this river or\nYou can make this race or\nYou want to talk about Donald Trump on force errors Gallo you can make this self\nAs Warren affectionately refer to as the bad Pocahontas you want to talk about stepping in it in a way that is spectacular\nAnd Donald Trump and his ... says not manage to do what is a little bit Warren has done to her cells inside of about twenty four hours\nIt is ... or ... friend Bryan mud or do a morning show W. J. you know in West Palm Beach ideally mid morning show\nW. I. O. D. in Miami and occasionally I I think when they are uh you know kind of desperate for so many people on TV Fox News looking around to doing something with me in the end it's not that was that last weekend the mid term elections\nAnd it was great actually it was kinda waiting for the moment like I'll give anything illegal or try once\nAnd I was waiting for them to uh to to try to get me and they never\nActually was just a a good experience so a baby or the world a special on the mid term elections that was actually a lot of fun now we are three weeks away three weeks ... days Twenty one days from the general election\nOn the entertainment it's endless hit absolutely analysts Elizabeth Warren poke honest about it when\nYou take a look at her test CNN headline here Elizabeth Warren releases test with strong evidence of ancestry now and the series of events that unfolded yesterday you had the Boston Globe and I believe was the first to kind of lose their board over the\nStairs to his Native American and I don't think they actually ended up really looking into the whole thing they simply ... she's got to have it in\nThe Boston Globe even miscalculated family\nOnly by a factor of about a thousand how much native blood she may have in her but they weren't the only wants to run with it it's it is CNN they ran with it to you here's an excerpt from a story there's yesterday\nSenator Warren has released the results of a DNA Analysis showing she has just in Native American ancestry and an apparent attempt to preempt further questions and attacks she run for president in twenty twenty\nOr and first face scrutiny for her purported Native American heritage during her twenty twelve sitting a race for president Donald Trump has revived and amplify the controversy has the eyes weren't as a possible liable frequently mocking her with a name broke on us\nWarren has now been documented in in obtaining documentation of baggage per family lore\nAnd and now it's just I've heard genetic data performed by Carlos Bustamante I get all of that name to write bustamante the\nName of credibility a professor of genetics at Stanford and an advisor to ancestry and twenty three and me\nIn a row video what bell warns heritage to Massachusetts Democrats as seen sitting behind a laptop as she calls bustamante\nNow the president likes to call my mom a liar\nOr and asked him what do the facts say a bustamante in response the facts such as that you absolutely have a Native American ancestry in your pedigree isn't the way that humans to talk to one another by the white\nPedigree isn't that one more usually like talking about the brain of an animal nothing if it's high it's just\nI have never in the in the context of this conversation when they were sent in my family or with somebody else and talking about their answers for like your your pedigree and tell me about your your pedigree so anyway bustamante talks of her pedigree\nWarranted show nominee bustamante for report now posted on warns website along with others supporting documents in interviews detailing her background according to the report oh this is\nJust kind of a minor detail here the majority horns identifiable ancestry is European oh however the report as however the analysis also identified find genetic segments\nAs Native American in origin at high confidence bustamante is analysis places warns Native American ancestry between six generations ago with a report estimating generations\nUh okay let's take a look at something here this is where\nThe Boston Globe and they're they're\nReally got off track by the way really got off track trying to figure out a the the six to ten generations okay so if maybe there was a little bit of a Native American thing going on let's say eight ... rations that go\nAlong with that equal here and the answer to warn as it turns out more lily white middle Whitey white folk like perhaps you want me\nIs what the experts have actually been able to find after they dug into the report on our website warps\nNow throughout the course of the day\nI have heard from my my friends still lives here in the in South Florida has been talking about this and the noise continues to be allowed out there and social media and it is fascinating the dearth of knowledge on this particular subject that seemingly the average Alaska to want to be socialists\nActually has about Elizabeth Warren received a question why is it why is it that this is even an issue well the first thing happens to be made in one again [laughter] and she was already ill nobody told her to go out there and get oh actually President Trump did\nPresident Trump did in fact ah do you have cut three ready\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] uh let me think about that one [noise] she's on being a minority [noise]\n'cause they always say well I'll let you guys are saying is [noise] and I apologize audience tonight [noise] apologizing [noise] ...\n[noise]\nYou know even the liberals are saying\nTesting is entertaining and president Donald J Trump president of the United states at a rally back in July she says she's the one who put it back out there you have to wonder\nYesterday that the president prompting her like that you think she was asked\nIf she supposed to be ideally educated right\nWhen you actually like try to figure out exactly what the results of your test would mean before you go out there and say yeah you know I'm a I'm turkey\nHere it is and then the experts you\nActually know lighter than the average white folk here in the United states just saying go either way but that wasn't the best smack down the ball now in the grand scheme of of entertainment and uh the the full fledged W W E version kind of smack down here\nThat came from none other than the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior this was the statement that he put out yesterday\nCrying DNA test do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were in detention it's in North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations said the only legal requirements for citizenship in a while DNA test can be used to determine lineage such as fraternity to an individual it's not evidence for tribal affiliations\nOh by the way he was a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA testing and it's a legitimate uses while also does honoring a legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who is heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interest with hurricane tenuous claims of tribal heritage\nIs once again so goes the dynamite any questions you can have the the president the United states were forward to\nElizabeth Warren a bad book on us as he might say as a fraud\nBut we only have to do is listen to the secretary of the Cherokee Nation that she claims to be enough\nTo call for re fraud\nOh by the way how many details you know these little things part of the the liberal argument that I've heard of answer out today it's well I mean what difference does it make anyway in Trump's tax returns okay let's talk about the tax return thing real quick so let's\nWater phony he continued you went down there he had a lot of fun just worried that now that her claims of being Indian Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam an ally\nElizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetuating this brought against the American public Harvard called her a person of color amazing God and would not have taken her otherwise and again this is the important point here we're talking about the Elizabeth Warren deal is not just oh it's another politician line it's not that\nNumber one enemy is a lie it is a fraud but she has kept up her entire adult life\nBut secondly it's not a victimless situation she committed fraud for personal gain every single step of the white educationally professionally even went in because a couple of steps along her career path\nThese institutions and identify her as a Caucasian\nShe made sure that she was always referred to and had it would have changed that she was Native American or a person of color seriously seriously\nBut in the president's always end up he said thank you to the Cherokee Nation already feeling that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas you can just see him and hear him saying that to ... is a complete and total fraud and again\nYou don't have to listen to me you don't have to listen to the president United States all you have to do taken straight from the tribe that she claimed to be part of\nA kind of tough for her to rally back from that one of the way the the president in terms of toys holy cow he had all kinds of moments today including moments in with a story Daniels now to be ready for it to you was I guess horse face\nThat that that happened today but uh we we have a bunch of other stuff obviously it's been going on in the news including the Saudi Arabians situation will be discussing that a little bit of a leader in the show we have the oh by the white Honduran caravan part whatever that says three point oh\nThat is on its way here and this was a really cool thing president twenty now\nUnited States has strongly and formed a president upon doors but at the large
