line by purity products have your host mark Simone so\nGlad you could join us today it's a power pack program in fact our story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated\nAudiences around North America with a special segment of the French paradox\nYou remember the French paradox this is the counterintuitive concept that says red wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight\nOr energy healthy aging and even longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was spiritual yes ... the active ingredient found in\nThat's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nNow our guest today says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce Robert Twenty years Dr president has been an institutional New York radio host in his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a longtime products formula later and high level advisor for purity products that depressed mood welcome aboard\nMark always great speaking to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's touch and the reason we're it's also nominate those people out there who just to vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... and why is it all over the news today\nWell first of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals a week and every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically resveratrol is what we call a poly sci and all it's found in red wine it's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found and peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when raspberries role was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms that even some fish\nWell anything that extends the life of anything is going to pick the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow what by two thousand six\nItalian scientist discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and it even increase their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex and here's what really got them interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair\nReported that resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice by thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seemed to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon definitely supported normal and some attic activity in the body it improved indoor and\nWas even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring story aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school in New York I was just reading\nAt an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent well whenever our health is threatened any proceed to health threat like not eating enough\nCaloric restriction your body feels threatened switches on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the\nAccording to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard notice it's important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just step back from\nAre now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years under co Q. formulas but now the teacher co enzyme Q. ten which is just as important as reservists role especially for your heart health and your says in some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs to ten and what exactly is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick pick a what a co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place like a vitamin in many respects\nWell co Q. ten is the new trend that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful antibiotics and and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's awhile ago\nWhile I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point and this is Nineteen sixty three\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heart beat they were literally looking at hearts and saying\nWhat is making this darn thing beat well they found out that was co Q. ten and that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell\nKnow there was a key molecule found in red wine which is studying at Harvard and I knew that it activates genes are those are just to to talk to us about all the excitement surrounding ... and why you specifically wanted him this formula while\nI tell you the researchers at Harvard under the leadership of Dr David Sinclair this is what they found\nCaloric restriction eating less slows the pace of aging\nThat's pretty darn impressive and what they found in the laboratory studies of animals is that an extended lifespan and it appeared that caloric restriction eating less food and you're eating right now by a certain percentage increases your longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity of what we call a longevity gene\nThey get switched on they help improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt in fact this is Jean helps increased tissue repair and its switched on by a group of genes called sirtuin now they found two things at Harvard number one caloric restriction\nIncreases these longevity genes these are two inch\nWell so does resveratrol\nAt least in their animal studies and this is exactly ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works in humans as it does and these animals and I'm optimistic it will\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially using their traditional compound like resin ... actively target the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement that our health and our aging and our longevity\nWell now that the president you say that took you ten holds an elite status in the nutritional supplements industry because it's been so well documented and so well researched you call this evidence based nutrition maybe give us a brief overview of the research and explain why it took you ten research is so widely respected\nWell let's go back to Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin the Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight\nThe University of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana Stockholm University in Sweden the great study recently at the University of and counting and Italy on mitochondrial energy and co Q. ten\nThe University of Grenada and Spain talking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti ... article published constantly throughout the world\nThe archives of biochemistry and bio synthesis the proceedings of the national Academy of sciences major studies major universities right here in the United states and abroad the bottom line and these studies\nEnergetic mitochondria without co Q. ten you don't have energy combine that with resveratrol I'm telling you pretty darn amazing\nNow that you present purity products occasionally does these free bottled give away with this one sounds really special wasted is so important\nWell I mean you really get an opportunity you get a chance to see for yourself what I'm Talking about I mean you can hear me speak about energy and physical performance and there's nothing quite like experiencing it for yourself\nI mean you hear me say some pretty amazing things\nThat you say well that's pretty

the vitamin D council and it's made me a believer but you added vitamin D and you've added vitamin B. twelve\nYeah now many people go through life not knowing that they've got to co Q. ten deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine while I mean that's a lot of people\nAnd we found out some pretty amazing things with all of this research now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin date of bone on bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health and immune system activity quite dramatically in fact it also helps support and brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy cold on top of all of that\nAnd a great new study out of the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and colon health I mean who thinks that those things right\nYeah that's amazing so I think it's a welcome addition to this amazing formula to co Q. super boosts formula in addition to that I said to channel look\nWe should put some B. twelve and here as well it's called ... and I say that because the twelve convert the carbohydrates and proteins and fat that you're

endurance to bill stamina I went to lift the following nutrients\nCo Q. ten resveratrol the twelve and vitamin D day this is the advantage as we're speaking about at rather than going out and buying

trial I've worked with scientists\nIn Europe and also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field and meet with the top scientists and my conclusion is that\nGreen tea ... came in from Tim recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that\nEverybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super foods the green tea human different spiritual why did you want a combined three there's always a method to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other work better you call it a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason to\nPut them all in separate products they do go very well together as you said they're all food derives so it's kind of like you can make a salad\nIf you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both\nAntioxidants so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies and protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial in\nOne product with truly meaningful amounts of each one not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing I Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging\nBut what are you seeing recently in the press I Know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti oxygen activity in whole blood glucose ion you recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nWhat you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume\nBut don't actually wind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nBeneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood and concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating\nAround in the body and protecting the cells of your body organs\nEvery part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are that right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue to thigh on\nSo you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue the thigh on so it is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do\nBut it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nLet's switch gears and talk about this human which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula really offering free brought on a few minutes but talk to me about the human which is spelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it but scientists and researchers know it's one of the most\nOver time taking a green tea extract can help you to have a better fat to lean muscle ratio so from a weight control standpoint this is very good news additionally green tea helps to stabilize blood glucose or blood sugar\nAnd unstable blood sugar is one of the contributing factors to increase the weight\nSo by stabilizing blood sugar you have an effect on weight control in weight management so it's really quite remarkable stuff you need enough of it we've got enough of it in green T. C. R. it has to be the right extract when you've got the right extract but the sciences there for healthy weight management\nRight now Chris you see that with purity\nFormula it provides you with about three cups with green tea in each to Capitol serving obese cutting edge liquids off Joe so you know the green tea is concentrated benefits for energy for heart health for alertness in just too soft gel caps plus you get the ... human and the ... too so it's easy you call it\nYour daily short cut to better health explain this idea of a healthy short cut and explain some of the top benefits as well\nWell I mean you could for example drink three cups of good concentrated green tea each day\nEat at least one really rich curry made with a lot of tumor accrued and drink a couple of glasses or red wine you could do that every day most people will not do that every day but they still might want the benefits of three of the biggest\nSuperstar protective health enhancing nutrients on the entire planet\nSo when I call this a daily short cut I'm simply saying that you can get in a capsule\nAnd a good liquid the soft gelatin capsule or otherwise have to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large you know tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing the medicine and are now in this new green T. C. R. formula for purity it's really about the research share it with some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the human that we didn't get to yeah I Know this is one of your favorite ingredients for joint comfort and even for brain health\nWell I especially like\nThe liver protective heart protective and joint modifying\nProperties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment in fact blood and studies show that newborn babies contain two hundred industrial pollutants\nIn their blood at the time of birth so we need a functioning super healthy very strong liver\nWe might not think about our livers that much but we need that and and we know that curriculum and protect the liver at detoxify deliver it keeps a strong from a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart\nIt's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels\nFrom a joint standpoint we have in numerous bolt studies showing overall improvement in joined health\nAnd relief and stable inflammatory activity better joint mobility as a result of taking Kirk him and I like the brain protective studies as well you know I think everybody wants a sharper clearer mind\nAnd Kirk human delivers all this so I regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body\nSo I regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware pat but most people are not going to eat enough rock tumor Rick route to get the benefits that they should and that they can get from a concentrated curriculum and extract\n[noise] I don't want to remind people didn't call now to get started with a free bottle of green tea CPR for purity products this is their unique green tea formula would see Kirk human and the ... each of free bottled today just before Ninety five for shipping coal now operators are standing by one eight hundred\nFor nine nine seven five zero five again one eight hundred\nFor nine nine seven five zero five right back to the show 'cause I don't want to get to technical here but these anti accidents and green tea or classified as police females and they really aren't super powerful and well respected by scientists\nBut in this green T. C. R. formula there's more it's got the green tea it's got the ... the written very thoroughly we talked about\nClass grape seed extract pine bark bio fibroids vitamin C can you talk to me about this array of really super anti accidents and poli sci fi knows that you put in the formula\n[noise] well yeah I won't say that we kind of went over killed but I Will say that we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here\nGrape seed extract in pine bark extract\nBoth contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds that not only do much of what I've already described but also enhance the physical integrity of tissue in the blood vessels and the skin so we put those in there for\nExtra boost in antioxidant activity\nBut also for a specific type of activity that isn't as much addressed by the green tea the curriculum and then there is there a troll the bio flab annoyed\nAnd hence the overall activity of vitamin C. and vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we can possibly take and so I Would say that we were very very thorough you know when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen\nIf we put in grape seed extract pine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C. we realize that we would have an orderly superior formula and just to reiterate pat\nI Want people to experience dynamic health I Want people to feel great\nThis formula the Greenpeace ER will make you feel great and that's the purpose of it\nNot Christian I Love this green T. C. R. combination formula and remember this ER stands for human ... spiritual loved that was his complimentary bottle today our listeners can get started for free that's great value what what people expect to pay if they bought all of these separately in the store\nWell I think if they bought high quality products that contain these ingredients they'd be into it for about Seventy five bucks or so possibly even eighty\nSo they wind up spending appreciably more than they're going to spend on the green tea see our formula and they still wouldn't get the grape seed extract they still wouldn't get the pine bark extract the ... the vitamin C.\nAnd Chris what kind of results can people expect to see what can they expect to see a once they start taking this formula\nI think that people will feel greater joint mobility and comfort\nI think they'll feel more energy\nBecause these ingredients also help to stabilize and maintain natural healthy blood sugar control\nI think they'll have more sustained energy throughout the day and I would just suspect that people will have an experience of greater vitality when you detoxify the body when you have a more highly functional immune system\nYou just feel more energy and better overall it's kind of you know like those days when you get up and go wow I feel great this is a while I feel great formula\nNow Chris the green tea see are limited history to provide you bought three cups worth of green tea and each to cancel serving plus you get the anti accident equivalent of several servings of fruits and vegetables plus\nYou get the ... of several servings of red wine and the joint comfort in brain function benefits of the curriculum and I mean while the only one formula in the last two minutes talk to me about this short cut to better health and why you want everyone listening to this program to call now from that complimentary bottle green tea see are\nOkay fortunately\nThere's and the man's body of science that has been growing steadily for the past Twenty years and it's really rich science now we know that of the various plant derived substances that exist green tea extract ... extract and ... extract are at the absolute\nTop of the list of protective\nVitality and ... overall health promoting compounds there just isn't anything like these there in the green tea CRC our standing for ... product in meaningful amounts people will take this product it will be\nRapidly broken down in the system very well absorbed they're going to feel the difference you're going to feel energy you're going to feel more vitality or just plain going to feel better kind of more fluid and in that flow of good health so I Want people to experience that and\nGiven that they can get a free bottle I'm also not saying that put yourself at great risk and spend a lot of money and say no try it free let the product speak for itself\nChristian them as always fascinated information we appreciate your insight thanks so much\nThank you pat it's always a pleasure to speak with you\nThere's an incredible free bottle offered today on purity amazing new green tea CPR super formula here's the deal purity products right now be one of the first thousand polish today just pay for Ninety five for shipping which is one hundred percent refundable if you're gonna rush you any complimentary bottle of green T.
