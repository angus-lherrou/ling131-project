worn there may be more out there uh thankfully none have been a a\nActually exploded no one has been injured but the breaking news is that a suspect has been arrested\nWe're waiting a an address by President Trump to comment on this arrest or just to give you a reminder this began back on Monday or the suspect has been arrested in Florida\nA twelve packages there were two more uh out this morning a to a senator Cory Booker and to James Clapper former director of national intelligence that was also said to us that one was to CNN again I think there was a partial\nEvacuation there we want to get into this uh for the beginning of the show and then we're going to get into\nThe election day because I've again folks you just can't ignore the fact that we are eleven days out\nFrom the mid term elections and the president's very busy on the campaign trail but also dealing with serious issues like the the migrant care available update you on that\nUh like the situation of all bing these bombs and or or potential explosive devices I think we need to find out more before we categorize exactly what they were where they fakes where they real about what we do know is good news is that the suspect has been arrested hopefully that is the person\nResponsible and let me go right to Andrew accountable for a U.S attorney Andy if this is the person responsible they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law\nRegardless of these were fake devices or not or devices that just did not work they were targeting federal officials are well known people former federal officials as well and using the mail service to do so\nThat's why these are federal crimes as well as ... crimes in each of the states\nUh start with the state's these are considered clearly acts of terror in in ... in Georgia for example we call them terrorists threats and that's usually the law and other jurisdictions federally they are the uh interstate transportation of articles use\nFor ... inflicting terrorist activities so these are both federal and state crimes and this person or should be definitely a interrogated in great detail or sue me he may I ask for a lawyer in which case the\nQuestion he has to stop but those are the extent law enforcement can get information out of him or that would be the best thing that could possibly happen\nYeah and it appears the suspect was arrested without kind of a fight that he's alive yeah um and so that he could be questioned a and find out more about this individual even see images right now on television about his vehicle or this happening all in a north of Miami in plantation\nAnd sunrise Florida which is kind of inland from Fort Lauderdale if you're listening from that area it appears to be and we knew that that was the post office the packages were emanating from was from that north Miami area\nA but again I suspect has been apprehended arrested\nAnd a two more devices intercepted today law enforcement instead listen just because we have arrested this person they could have mailed out many more devices so people still need to be vigilant especially those who would be a you can kind of put that list together and figure out who is a more likely than not to receive a package like this\nAnd uh I'm sure we'll find out more about this person whoever they are are they are someone who should be prosecuted\nTo the full extent of the law um politics aside here even though this seems\nPolitically motivated and that was an ideology there's a place where this American politics we have vigorous debates vigorous disagreements but we've never resort to terrorism or violence and full extent of the law the ... the law should be thrown at him\nAnd this person's has been a lot of time behind bars we'll talk about

arrested in Florida for these or what have been called pipe bombs none of exploded no one has been injured thank thank God uh twelve so far have been intercepted to high profile people mostly on the left\nUm in some in the media or the we don't know by the way just because this person was arrested\nAs a suspect does that mean there were others involved and it does it mean there are other packages out there and so if you work at the postal service or if you work for a member of Congress we have people who listen on both sides of the aisle\nOr listen to be vigilant still because ah this person could have bailed out many more packages or before they were they were arrested they've been under surveillance\nFor at least twenty four hours or we started hearing yesterday about this image dating in the north Miami area and that's in fact where the arrest was made and a vehicle taken the vehicle was taken 'em uh one arrested sunset and in what the patient a Florida it's just kind of a west of\nSo ... uh Fort Lauderdale north of\nMiami we have a name a Caesar say oc\nHe does have a criminal record for grand theft I'm a criminal ... nothing that would relate to kind of this pipe bombing or ... these kind of it since we don't know his profile social media whether there were other kind of warning signs about him whether he was acting alone but I Do want to update you on that\nUh that is the news as as as we have it right now the breaking news of today\nThere is also breaking news on the care of it and I want to get right to the phones on that now they have been is joining us and the second half hour broadcasts were going to go right into the mid term elections were only eleven days out\nWe got a lot to talk about the Senate and the house and races that are changing or some favoring Republican some favoring Democrats were going to get into all of that but let's first talk about the care bad because there's some news there as well\nUh let's go first to Tracy in Virginia on line to Tracy welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nThank you so much I usually when this all started when they were on your way up here [noise]\nWell I think we know that there was a organization behind this or that started this I've got that they're actually base to the United states in in uh in Oakland, California way below sin Fronteras which means village Without Borders\nSo it's a U.S based in geo that funds these caravans this is much larger\nThan the previous caravan that that we all kind of remember back in April\nThat started with about Fifteen hundred people dwindled down to around five hundred\nWho ultimately made it to the border more than a hundred of those were arrested for illegal entry some of the others were granted a their first level of asylum so they were allowed entry on it the silent basis or what it appears as it this group one of their strategies may have been in that case is to do the group down\nTo those who could make a serious claim for asylum but this is a again an activist organization based in the United states\nFor silent but this is a I get an activist organization based in the United states working with leftist politicians in Central America the different tiers this caravan is much larger\nThe estimates are anywhere between three four five six thousand all the way to fourteen thousand it's still pretty far away\nFrom the United states than but the president's taking steps to department of defense to secure our border and these two locations and even thinking about closing a border crossings using the executive order we fought so hard for on on uh the immigration and visa yeah a couple of\nThings during the first of all on the origins of the Caribbean I think it's crystal clear in this case to ... there were a lot of political motives of from the left it for the origins of this\nA Caribbean but still even so he leaves the United states in the in the predicament of having to sort through what the group looks like in the end whenever approaches the border so you're going to have\nA certainly people that should not be allowed into the United states then you're going to have people that will claim asylum those will have to be processed\nAccording to the law by the way there are some some statutory changes that probably need to be made but it is incumbent on the president to use all of the leverage that is available to him you mentioned the executive order he's already engaging the national guard the military to go down to the border of course he's also said that he would be denying foreign aid to countries that don't cooperate with us\nAnd Jordan I think maybe most importantly he has to distinguish between the countries that this caravan is passing through that might have the capacity to work with us to stop it I mean\nYou know Honduras Guatemala El Salvador they really didn't have a capacity to stop this hair ban\nBut Mexico does and you had seen the president engage the Mexican government\nOr their ... seems like they're cooperating it seems like the the it'd be goal here is to stop the caravan before I get here because Jordan if and when a group does get here the United states will have an obligation to sort through whoever's there if the borders not shut down and determine who might have a legal point and\nThey were talking about the legal claim for asylum right on which is different than immigration law and asylum you have to prove that your life is in jeopardy and you've got to have evidence of that\nYou also have to prove that the countries that you pass through we're not safe\nSo it's supposed to be the the first safe country you get to outside of your home country if you're looking for asylum is where you were supposed to declare asylum that's under the un standards of international law and US law so if you were someone fleeing Honduras because there's a specific threatened under us and you got to a town in Mexico\nOr city in Mexico you should be claiming asylum there\nAnd the Mexican authorities would then go through that process about whether or not you meet the qualifications now we know people want to get to the U.S and we have allowed a I think the walls are not tough enough\nPeople to keep crossing through multiple countries and then heading to our border and making an asylum claim and ... and say well you know I didn't really want these other places I couldn't be safe either in some cases individual cases that may be true\nBut the vast majority you should be able to claim asylum in the first places called the first place you land\nFirst place you touch foot in his outside of your home country when you're under the jurisdiction of a new law enforcement um and the new country or the new sovereign territory I could take your phone calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to remember our second half hour\nWe're talking all midterms are so ... and your calls about that as well eleven days out from the mid term elections will give you updates on the key Senate races house races how things are looking one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to that one hundred sixty four three one zero let's go to Roger in Virginia on line for Raj welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nTank you face Rosh\n... and what you're doing [noise] of course to the things that I kept comments on it specifically because this is also [noise]\n... but it being used in horse and miners\nYeah well we we know that there are a lot of our department of homeland security\nHas reported that there are known criminals gang elements middle Easterners or people who are not from Central American I just said and obviously those who would use a caravan like this to take advantage of it for bad any legal purposes and you're talking about the disease issue there's this these are all issues you have to face\nIf it makes it to your border and you decide to open those crossings to process the applications let me try to grab one more call quickly before we go into our our next break Laurie in a Arkansas on line one Lorrie welcome to Jay secular life\nAll right thanks for taking my call Troy scale Hitler any opportunity for the United nations to get involved to protect our border\n[noise] I don't think we want the un\nInvolves on protecting our borders they they get involved with their regional military conflicts like between two countries are not when the country should be able to work together\nLike the U.S and Mexico to deal with this so they're involved in Lebanon Israel border and Gaza Israel is places like that\nAt least in Africa not where two allies\nWere together so let's not get the UN involved much handle this between us and Mexico working together and hopefully long before this caravan reaches [noise] our southern border we come back mid term elections eleven days away politics get your calls in one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tenth [noise]\nIt's a critical time for nationwide I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for lunch or has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ online sign up right now the OJ daughter\nThe reason New Jersey tells such a story across the landscape the United States Senate is because the Democrats Jordan cannot afford to lose a single seat that they currently occupy and then they need to a U.S essentially sweep the competitive races that the Republicans\nAre defending if they're losing New Jersey Jordan it tells me that they are going to lose a lot of seats that they're holding and likely would not flip any that the Republicans are holding so you could be looking at a scenario where Republicans have fifty four fifty five fifty six\nFifty seven seats in the United States Senate if Bob Menendez is anywhere on the map Jordan the Democrats are in a lot of trouble in the United States Senate\nAnd if if the house where to go Democrat but you have that kind of Republican majority of the Senate it does give Republicans a lot more power bargaining power along with the president who's a Republican in the White House the executive branch\nUh to to deal I mean if you want to get things done first of all the Senate handles all the confirmations of officials and judges so it would not impact that if the house goes Democrat\nBut legislation obviously you want to be able to legislate get budgets through make changes make fixes there's some big issues like immigration is well there'll be a lot tougher with the Democrat majority but we're not there yet I mean I Want to stay on the Senate first let's move to North Dakota this is one\nYou say is is so key because I'm basically you wouldn't North Dakota that you know\nThe GOP at least keeps the Senate majority\nIn North Dakota is the reason that I'm convinced that the Republicans are going to keep the United States Senate is just a matter of margin and here's why Jordan because Republicans come in with a fifty one to forty nine a seat advantage I think there are only two seats that that the Democrats still have a chance to pull away from the Republicans that's in Arizona and Nevada\nSo then if they held every other seat that they have Jordan or they would only have a one seat majority well I think they're going to lose the seat in North Dakota I think Heidi Heitkamp is going to lose the congressman Kevin Cramer\nAgain like we talked about New Jersey the numbers are just moving rapidly in his direction the difference here Jordan is he is moving from a close race to a blowout raised in his favor as opposed to what Bob Menendez is doing which is closing the gap so I think\nThat is going to be a be a flip to the Republicans and then if they if the Democrats when every other ... competitive seat on the map it would be a fifty fifty spread for Republicans and vice president Pence would cast a tie breaking\nVote let me tell you something folks you are a politically in touch audience that were they want to hear from you or eleven days out have you\nTaken part in the early voting uh what do you sensing in your own state as you watch or even across the country because we can all see kind of what's happening as we're national broadcast in different places but we'd love to hear from you one eight hundred six eight four\nThirty one ten or you've vigorously backing candidates have you already voted are you talking to your friends and family about where do you get the sense that the momentum is is it by Republicans that behind Democrats and a lot of that will depend on\nWhere you happen to live and sometimes it's you know where you happen to live in what part of the state or what part of a city that you happen to live and give us a call we really want your thoughts on that one eight hundred six eight four thirty one time we know you all enjoy discussing politics and we have an opportunity to do it here was eleven days until the very important\nMid term elections so we talked about North Dakota Tennessee in Texas these were two states than the Democrats really had their eyes on in Tennessee\nIt was in the Senate race it was a Phil Bredesen or former governor a running as a supposedly ... moderate Democrat versus a congresswoman a Marsha Blackburn a well known to people who are Fox News and conservative in the conservative world\nThat race was looking very tight and President Trump came down\nCabinet news came out reticent tried to play this oh I Would vote for capital his staff got caught on camera saying he just said that for politics you added those two things together trumping down there\nHis staff being caught saying he wouldn't actually voted for Kavanaugh ... he was just saying they have to get elected and the poll numbers there have gone very strongly in favor of marsh apply for the momentum is behind the Republicans and there and the Republican gubernatorial candidate they're also so they they have a lot of 'em it's up to\nYou know for the first of all globally and those two states Jordan tendency in Texas I think these were the two states that Democrats were trying to broaden the playing field on we talked about how Arizona and Nevada look like they're they're only to pick up opportunities at this point\nI think Democrats were hoping that Tennessee in Texas would be places where they could at games and then we might get to Texas in a minute but I think that's why you've seen some of the fundraising numbers there\nAre but look Phil Bredesen or Jordan I'm just going to call it like I see it I I think he was running a strong campaign and then made a fatal mistake I think Tennessee voters\nA stand firmly behind a President Trump's a Supreme Court list I think they they stood behind the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd they were glad to hear that Phil Bredesen was going to vote for him and then it was revealed that that was just a political statement and he was making it when in reality if he'd been in the United States Senate there was almost no indication\nThat he would do it in fact his staff admitted that he probably wouldn't\nDuring the I think that probably was the last nail in the political cough and for for Phil Bredesen\nNow that would say whether we're talking about Tennessee or Texas or any of these states because of what you just described about at a early voting no matter what we say or anyone else you cannot take any of these races for granted because during that will tell you this there will be one state\nThat will surprise everybody on the map and I can't tell you where that will be so no matter what we say here you don't take any of these states for\nI mean listen in most polls Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee running for Senate against practice and has got like a six point lead one still has brought us in a recent poll with one point lead and other shows like her with a fourteen partly as stamps that people were voted early maybe before that British and controversy about Kavanaugh\nSo favor certainly going in Marsha Blackburn is direction and in the gubernatorial race there favoring the Republican is well Billy uh in that race so again it looks like that is no longer really in play\nFor the Democrats will tell you full breath says a lot of resources so he's up on TV there in Tennessee and we'll be through election day\nDon't take anything for granted polls are polls they just had to give you the sense of momentum you could see when things have really shifted it certainly hasn't Tennessee and let's go to Texas day into because that was another one where a again a very liberal\nThe and let's go to Texas day into because that was another one where a again a very liberal congressman or a ... a has a mass\nThis huge campaign war chest a but President Trump came down a things got a little more serious and now Ted Cruz's every single poll has got a lead outside the margins just barely but outside the margin\nYeah look anytime you raise funds like better or cash it's going to be a race that deserves a lot of attention because these are going to be all over the airwaves you national money pouring in a you know the ability to have aggressive get out the vote\nA key bay so did the dollars that bed or raise really were remarkable Jordan but look a in a in a in an environment where it's the state that is probably the most concerned about border security I think his position on immigration and\nAnd the borders and the wall is probably going to prove a politically fatal to him as well so look I think the polling their shows Ted Cruz opening up a six to eight\nA vote lead a I think at the end of the day he will carry that seat but look you if you're living in Texas Jordan you are going to see commercials nonstop because Beto O'Rourke has dollars to spend like we've never seen before\nA couple of states that we will get to give you a preview Arizona Nevada these are really a seats that are running margin of error is very tight races there or we will talk about when we come back and we had a quick question is Ted Cruz is sit on Facebook doing enough to be\n... it looks like he is I mean partnering with President Trump also has a big campaign war chest that he's got a lot of money to spend in these final days in early voting and all that but it's printing and Ted Cruz's direction he'll continue to work hard we know Senator Cruz well he's going to take anything for granted but I Do believe he will\nCarry the day there's nowhere eleven days out\nFrom the election in bed or certainly put together something if you will be right back\nIt's a historic move now

thirty one ten and we have breaking news on these are suspicious\nA hundred and sixty four thirty one ten and we have breaking news\nOn these suspicious packages bombs thankfully none that exploded or that the total couch so far has been twelve devices law enforcement has worn there may be more out there I thankfully none have been a a\nActually exploded no one has been injured but the breaking news is that the suspect has been arrested\nWe're waiting a an address by President Trump to comment on this arrest or just to give you a reminder this began back on Monday a the suspect has been arrested in Florida a twelve packages there were two more uh out this morning a to a senator Cory Booker\nAnd to James Clapper former director of national intelligence that was also said to us that one was sent to CNN again I think there was a partial evacuation there we want to get into this uh for the beginning of the show and then we're going to get into the election day because again folks you just can't ignore the fact that we are eleven days out\nFrom the mid term elections and the president's very busy on the campaign trail but also dealing with serious issues like the the migrant caravan will update you on that\nAre like the situation involving these bombs and or or potential explosive devices I think that we need to find out more before we categorize exactly what they were were they fakes where they real about what we do know is good news is that a suspect has been arrested hopefully that is the person\nResponsible and let me go right to Andrew accountable for a U.S attorney Andy if this is the person responsible they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law\nRegardless if these were fake devices or not or devices that just did not work they were targeting federal officials are well known people former federal officials as well and using the mail service to do so that's\nWhy these are federal crimes as well as ... crimes in each of the states\nUh star with the state's these are considered clearly acts of terror in in in in Georgia for example we call them terrorists threats and that's usually the law and other jurisdictions federally they are the uh interstate transportation of articles used\nFor inflicting terrorist activities so these are both federal and state crimes in this person or should be definitely a interrogated in great detail or sue me he may I ask for a lawyer in which case the\nQuestioning has to stop but those are the extent law enforcement can get information out of him a that would be the best thing that could possibly happen\nYeah and it appears the suspect was arrested without kind of fight that he's alive yeah I'm In some of that you could be questioned a and find out more about this individual even see images right now on television about his vehicle or this happening all in a north of Miami in plantation\nAnd sunrise Florida which is kind of inland from Fort Lauderdale if you're listening from that area it appears to be and we knew that that was the post office the packages were emanating from was from that north Miami area\nA but again I suspect has been apprehended arrested\nAnd a two more devices intercepted today law enforcement is that listen just because we have arrested this person they could have mailed out many more devices so people still need to be vigilant especially those who would be a you can kind of put that list together and figure out who is a more likely than not to receive a packets like this\nAnd uh I'm sure we'll find out more about this person whoever they are are they are someone who should be prosecuted\nTo the full extent of the law um politics aside here even though this seems\nPolitically motivated and that was an ideology there's a place where this American politics we have vigorous debates vigorous disagreements but we never resort to terrorism or violence and vote extent of the law the ... the law should be thrown at him\nAnd this person's and spend a lotta time behind bars we'll talk about at one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten we get into the caravan as well so if you've got questions about the\nPipe bombs give us a call the caravan one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten and then we're going to get into electoral politics one eight hundred six eight for three one one zero give us a call

Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is Israel's true capital\nOf the state of Israel and it's very right to exist as a lynchpin issue not only in the middle east but represents a critical issue to the world at large Israel is facing unprecedented challenges enemies about\nISIS come on the law in Iran\nAll pledged white Israel from the severe\nIn his new book New York times best selling author Jean secular presents a powerful political and historical rationale for the existence of Israel as a sovereign nation Jerusalem middle uncle and historical case for the Jewish capital presents clear irrefutable evidence to remove any doubt about Israel's right to exist\nIn the book do spells legal ... reported by Israel's in I mean\nHere's your copy today Jerusalem a biblical and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now an Amazon were born to know [noise]\n[noise] if you are\nJust joining us we have breaking news the suspect has been arrested in these pipe\nAnd we have a name now a just a name is ... is our say Iraq I think I pressed that right ah in Florida someone with a ... criminal history or for grants that back in twenty Thirteen or he's been arrested as the main suspect\nIn these twelve pipe bombs had been delivered so far\nThere were two more devices delivered a this morning I attempted to deliver they were all you know intercepted or those who were going to Cory Booker or the senator and James Clapper uh CNN contributor and former director of national intelligence that would just CNN again um the the so far this started on Monday\nWith a pipe bomb it it's a Soros home\nUh none of these have exploded no one has been injured but it has caused a lot of tear member the evacuation of the time we're talking about the significance that with the\nHotel with the office buildings with the apartment buildings with the grocery store shopping um with CNN located there I mean the effect has caused terror\nEven if these devices were voting or\nIt has caused terror even if these devices were phony\nOr just weren't built correctly a and that would be a good thing that thankfully no one was injured there's no place for this or politics eleven days out from mid term elections it's certainly a puts things into perspective\nUm but it does not mean we can't have vigorous debates and disagreements in our country or without resorting to not just violence but tear\nWhich is what this is is that acts as a domestic terror and the tempted uh to to terrorize other people and yet we condemn it to the fullest extent of should we have a name now a again of the suspect we do the location in Florida sunrise in plantation Florida\nI'd appears a vehicle was in one of those locations homeless and the other location\nAssets are north of Miami kind of inland from Fort Lauderdale\nAnd uh and we don't know yet or if there were other people involved this is the suspect\nSo I get it may not be over the president is planning to address this that happens while we're live on the air we will certainly cover it I Want to take a your your comments or Nancy on face became and we're taking your phone calls as well at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten\nNancy on Facebook rights and what kind of consequences does a person like this face and\nWell of course the obvious ... and then most appropriate and prudent and proper consequence is that he's put in prison because someone like this is not\nFit to live in the society of human beings and they're locked away for a period of time because they've obviously committed or attempted to commit the the most terrible crimes are and and then the worst scenario this could be considered an attempted murder\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ACL Jane member today it's easy to do is go on line sign up you know Jay dawn\n[noise]\n\nJason ... this is Jordan secular appreciate any kind of a joining us to talk about the law enforcement\nSide if you are just joining us there's breaking news I suspect has been arrested in Florida\nFor these or what have been called pipe bombs none of exploded no one has been injured thank thank God uh twelve so far have been intercepted to high profile people mostly on the left um in some in the media\nOr the we don't know by the way just because this person was arrested\nAs a suspect does not mean there were others involved and it does it mean there are other packages out there and so if you work at the postal service or if you work for a member of Congress we have people who is on both sides of the aisle\nOr listen to be vigilant still because a person could have bailed out many more packages or before they were they were arrested they've been under surveillance\nFor at least twenty four hours a week started hearing yesterday about this imitating in the north Miami area and that's in fact where the arrest was made and a vehicle taken the vehicle was taken 'em uh one arrested sunset and in what the patient a Florida just kind of a west of\nSo it'll in uh Fort Lauderdale ... of\nA Miami we have a name a Caesar say oc\nHe does have a criminal record for grand theft I'm a criminal side nothing that would relate to kind of this pipe bombing or ... these kind of it since we don't know his profile social media whether there were other kind of warning signs about him whether he was acting alone but I Do want to update you on that\nUh that is the news as as as we have it right now the breaking news of today\nThere's also breaking news on the care of it\nAnd I want to get right to the phones on that now they had been is joining us and the second half hour broadcasts were going to go right into the mid term elections were only eleven days out\nWe got a lot to talk about the Senate and the house and races that are changing or some favoring Republican some favoring Democrats were going to get into all of that but let's first talk about the care bad because there's some news there as well\nUh let's go first to Tracy in Virginia on line to Tracy welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nThank you so much I usually when this all started when he said that they were on your way up here [noise]\nWell I think we know that there was a organization behind this or that started a this I've got that they're actually base to the United states\nIn in uh in Oakland, California way below sin from terrorists which means village Without Borders so it's a U.S base in geo that funds these caravans this is much larger\nThan the previous care bandit that we all kind of remember back in April\nStarted with about Fifteen hundred people dwindled down to around five hundred\nWho ultimately made it to the border more than a hundred of those were arrested for illegal entry some of the others were granted a their first level of asylum\nSo they were allowed to ... ... asylum basis of what it appears is it this group one of their strategies may have been in that case is to dwindle the group down to those who could make a serious claim\nFor asylum but this is a I get an activist organization based in the United states working with leftist politicians in Central America the difference here\nAnd I did states working with leftist politicians in Central America the difference here's this caravan is much larger the estimates are are anywhere between three four five six thousand all the way to fourteen thousand it's still pretty far away\nFrom the United states than but the president's taking steps the department of defense to secure our border and these two locations and even thinking about closing\nA border crossings using the executive order we fought so hard for on on uh the immigration and visas yeah a couple of\nThings during the first of all and the origins of the Caribbean I think it's crystal clear in this case ... there were a lot of political motives of from the left it for the origins of this a caravan but still even show you leave the United states in the in the predicament of having to sort through what the group looks like in the end when every approaches the boarder she you're going to have\nA certainly people that should not be allowed into the United states then you're going to have people that will claim asylum those will have to be processed\nAccording to the law by the way there are some some statutory changes it probably need to be made but it is incumbent on the president to use all of the leverage that is available to him you mentioned the executive order he's already engaging the national guard the military to go down to the border of course he's also said that he would be denying foreign aid to countries that don't cooperate with us\nAnd Jordan I think maybe most importantly he has to distinguish between the countries that this caravan is passing through\nThat might have the capacity to work with us to stop it I mean you know Honduras Guatemala El Salvador they really didn't have a capacity to stop this hair ban\nBut Mexico does and you had seen the president engage the Mexican government\nOr their ... seems like they're cooperating it seems like the the ... the goal here is to stop the caravan before it gets here because Jordan if and when a group does get here the United states will have an obligation to sort through whoever's there if the borders not shut down and determine who might have a legal point and\nThey were talking about the legal claim for asylum ... which is different than immigration law an asylum you have to prove that your life is in jeopardy and you've got to have evidence of that\nYou also have to prove that the countries that you pass through we're not safe\nSo it's supposed to be the the first safe country you get to outside of your home country if you're looking for asylum is where you were supposed to declare asylum that's under the un standards of international law and US law so if you were someone fleeing Honduras because there's a specific threatened Honduras and you got to a town in Mexico\nOr city in Mexico you should be claiming asylum there\nAnd the Mexican authorities would then go through that process about whether or not you meet the qualifications now we know people want to get to the U.S and we've allowed a I think the laws are not tough enough\nPeople to keep crossing through multiple countries and then heading to our border and they're making an asylum claim and get and say well you know I didn't really want these other places I couldn't be safe either in some cases individual cases that may be true\nBut the vast majority you should be able to claim asylum in the first places called the\nFirst place you land firstly she touched foot in his outside of your home country when you're under the jurisdiction of a new law enforcement I'm In a in a new country or the new sovereign territory I can take your phone calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to remember our second half hour\nWe're talking all midterms are so ... and your calls about that as well eleven days out from the mid term elections will give you updates on the key Senate races house races how things are looking one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to that one eight hundred sixty four three one zero let's go to Roger in Virginia on line for Raj welcome to Jake check you alive\nTank\nTakes rush I'm sure you're doing [noise]\nOf course to the things that I kept comments on it specifically because this is also [noise] Xi's being\nThese horse and miners\nYeah well we we know that there are a lot of our department of homeland security\nHas reported that there are known criminals gang elements middle Easterners or people who are not from Central American descent and obviously those who would use a caravan like this to take advantage of it for bad any legal purposes and are you talking about the disease issue there's this these are all issues you have to face\nIf it makes it to your border and you decided to open those crossings to process the applications let me try to grab one more call quickly before we go into our our next break Laurie in Arkansas on line one Lorrie\nWelcome to Jay secular life\nAll right thanks for taking my call Gaylord is there any opportunity for the United nations to get involved can protect our borders [noise]\nI don't think we want the un\nInvolved on protecting our borders they they get involved with their regional military conflicts like between two countries are not when countries should be able to work together\nLike the U.S and Mexico to deal with this so they're involved in like Lebanon Israel border in Gaza Israel these places like that\nAt least in Africa not where two allies were together so let's not get the UN involved but handled this between us and Mexico working together\nHopefully long before this caravan reaches our southern border we come back mid term elections eleven days away politics get your calls in one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten [noise]\nIt's a critical time for our nation I Am for the world [noise]\nSo many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for lunch on has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ online sign up right now the OJ daughter\nThe reason New Jersey tells such a story across the landscape the United States Senate is because the Democrats Jordan cannot afford to lose a single seat that they currently occupy and then they need to a U.S essentially sweep the competitive races that the Republicans\nAre defending if they're losing New Jersey Jordan it tells me that they are going to lose a lot of seats that they're holding and likely would not flip any that the Republicans are holding so you could be looking at a scenario where Republicans have fifty four fifty five fifty six\nFifty seven seats in the United States Senate if Bob Menendez is anywhere on the map Jordan the Democrats are in a lot of trouble in the United States Senate\nAnd if if the house where to go Democrat but you have that kind of Republican majority in the Senate it does give Republicans a lot more power bargaining power along with the president who's a Republican in the White House the executive branch\nUh to to deal I mean if I Want to get things done first of all the Senate handles all the confirmations of officials and judges so it would not impact that if the house goes Democrat\nBut legislation obviously you want to be able to legislate get budgets through make changes make fixes there's some big issues like immigration is well it'd be a lot tougher with the Democrat majority but we're not there yet I mean I I Want to stay on the Senate first let's move to North Dakota this is one\nDo you say is is so key because I'm basically you wouldn't North Dakota that you know\nThe GOP at least keeps the Senate majority\nIn North Dakota is the reason that I'm convinced that the Republicans are going to keep the United States Senate is just a matter of margin and here's why Jordan because Republicans come in with a fifty one to forty nine\nA seat advantage I think there are only two seats that that the Democrats still have a chance to pull away from the Republicans that's in Arizona and Nevada\nSo then if they held every other seat that they have Jordan or they would only have a one seat majority well I think they're going to lose the seat of North Dakota I think Heidi Heitkamp is going to lose the congressman Kevin Cramer again like we talked about New Jersey the numbers are just moving rapidly and his direction the difference here Jordan\nIs he is moving from a close race to a blowout raised in his favor\nAs opposed to what bottom and then does is doing which is closing the gap so I think that is going to be a be a flip to the Republicans and then if they if the Democrats when every other ... competitive seat on the map it would be a fifty fifty spread from Republicans and vice president Pence would cast the tie breaking vote\nLet me tell you something folks you are a politically in touch audience I really want to hear from you or eleven days out have you\nTaken part in the early voting or what do you sensing in your own state as you watch or even across the country because we can all see kind of what's happening is we're national broadcast in different places but we'd love to hear from you one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one to enter you vigorously backing candidates\nHave you already voted are you talking to your friends and family about it where do you get the sense that the momentum is is it by Republicans that behind Democrats and a lot of that will depend on\nWhere you happen to live and sometimes it's you know where you happen to live and what part of the state or what part of a city that you happen to live and give us a call we really want your thoughts on that one eight hundred six eight four thirty one time we know you all enjoy discussing politics and we have an opportunity to do it here was eleven days until the very important\nMidterm elections so we talked about North Dakota tendency of Texas these were two states than the Democrats really had their eyes on in Tennessee\nIt was in the Senate race it was a Phil bred as sort of former governor or running as a supposedly ... moderate Democrat versus a congresswoman a Marsha Blackburn a well known to people who are Fox News and conservative in the conservative world\nThat race was looking very tight and President Trump came down\nCabinet news came out reticent tried to play this oh I Would vote for capital his staff got caught on camera saying he just said that for politics you added those two things together trumping down there\nHis staff being caught saying he wouldn't actually voted for Kavanaugh ... he was just saying they have to get elected and the poll numbers there have gone very strongly in favor Marcia lie for the momentum is behind the Republicans and there and the Republican gubernatorial candidate they're also so they they have a lot of momentum to\nYeah for the first of all globally on those two states Jordan Tennessee in Texas I think these were the two states that Democrats were trying to broaden the playing field on we talked about how Arizona and Nevada look like\nThey're they're only to pick up opportunities at this point I think Democrats were hoping that tendency in Texas would be places where they could add gains and then we might get to Texas and the minute I think that's why you've seen some of the fundraising numbers there\nAre but look Phil Bredesen or Jordan I'm just going to call it like I see it I I think he had was running a strong campaign and then made a fatal mistake I think Tennessee voters\nA stand firmly behind a President Trump's a Supreme Court list I think they they stood behind the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd they were glad to hear that Phil Bredesen was going to vote for him and then it was revealed that that was just a political statement and he was making it when in reality if he'd been in the United States Senate there was almost no indication\nThat he would do it in fact his staff admitted that he probably wouldn't during the I think that probably was the last nail in the political coffin for for Phil Bredesen now that would say\nWhether we're talking about Tennessee or Texas or any of these states because of what you just described about at a early voting no matter what we say or anyone else you cannot take any of these races for granted because door and I will tell you this there will be one state\nThat will surprise everybody on the map and I can't tell you where that will be so no matter what we stay here you don't take any of these states for\nGranted I mean listen in most polls Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee running for Senate against prejudice and has got like a six point lead one still has Brett is in a recent poll with one point lead and other shows like her with a fourteen partly as stance that people were voted early maybe before that reticent controversy about Kavanaugh\nSo favor certainly going in Marsha Blackburn direction and then the gubernatorial race there favoring the Republican is well Billy are in that race so again it looks like that is no longer really in play\nFor the Democrats I Will tell you a full bred says a lot of resources so he's up on TV there in Tennessee and we'll be through election day\nDon't take anything for granted polls are polls they just had to give you the sense of momentum you could see when things have really shifted it certainly hasn't Tennessee and let's go to Texas than too because that was another one where a

[noise]\nWashington the\nWells says one of the very surreal things\nWhat not you know people were not\nAn answer enough security officer for a number of years the fence around\nOf people in many countries we're paying for it and even though\nJust cause a lot of hurt that God is using this\nThis causes a lot of hurt\nI think that God is using that was planning to use this to bring blessing to surface now there are millions of people who've tried\nCommend us\nWhich can be inflamed passions yeah\nWe especially want to hang it strips and really\nA walk off that you can\nWas are engaged in some of\nYou\nBeen broadcast every one I thought we'd take this Friday to recap with a busy week but I Want to recap our conversation that\nWe had with pastor Andrew Brunson was the first long form interview he gave upon his release from captivity and turkey initially in a jail in house arrest came back to the United states this past weekend was with the president on Sunday we had him on the air on Tuesday\nAnd we had the chance to really talk to him about what is taking place and I thought uh it's really important for you to listen again to what he had to say now we've seen done a number of media interviews you heard of some of these in the open uh today's done a number of interview since then but I think the bachelor and what he says is going to do is he's going to go take a couple of months off he's going to write\nA wants to be deployed back on the mission field that's what he said he's calling has been his entire life to preach the gospel and that's what he's going to continue to do but I thought it would be very appropriate for us to reflect on the fact that this releases happen we'll hear from the pastor again but I understand the nature in scope of the work that went into this\nWe had both are legal efforts and that meant that the lawyers led by cc how our senior counsel was running that case for us uh she was in contact with the Turkish council during the entire process multiple court hearings up four days of trial over about five month period\nAnd you know that story then we also had the diplomatic effort of all this going on we were made multiple appearances at the United nations at the human rights council the U.N General assembly so we engaged on a whole host of levels the the UN's a commission or an arbitrary detention took up\nPastor Brunson case impact even though he's released were still responding to their inquiries because the Turks were glad they did this I think it was positive id will help us turkey relationship without question but\nYou can't ignore the fact that this was a terrible abuse that took place against a Christian pastor who's only crime was quote Christian nation which the Turks under their criminal system viewed as a crime\nThat that's what it was remember we translated the word and it said Christian ... so I say all that\nTo let you know I thought it would be important that we end the week to recap where we were and where we come from up in this case and to hear again from pastor Brunson a call your friends to listen in on this I ... I think it's really important you hear the words especially now that some time has gone up because look this is what happens with these cases they're out\nThey come out there is an initial flurry of news coverage and then it goes quiet as a pastor and his wife and family return to light back in the United states that are waiting for their next assignment and taking some time for freshmen and relaxation which they need\nBut again I Want to thank you all are members of the American Center for law and justice for helping us make this case happened here supported the ACL Jay allows us to do exactly what we did here and I also want to thank our friends in the media many\nOf you listening to this broadcast shopper political information as a member of media friends listen in every day as

there for twenty three years before I was arrested and our main goal was to uh go and preach to this Christ\nOne of the main things we were involved in with church planting we're of all that several church plants and then in the last couple of years when there was a surge of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attacks since area a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAnd he's the OJ member today it's easy to do online signed L. J. on\n[noise]\nWe're joined by pastor Andrew Brunson were thrilled to have in the first time we've had him on a radio\nBroadcast obviously just out of a turkey and we're glad that he's home in the United states having said that I Know pastor your heart though is for the most for the people of turkey and I'm sure that has not changed\nBut no we we still love turkey or ... years ago and we are expecting that there will be a great artist in Turkey\nYep so who do you talked about the first year you said you were broken in January we covered ear extensively you had a ... you were in a jail with twenty two people that was originally designed for eight or you had very harsh conditions are talking about the second year\nYeah so the first year of feel like I was broken down and a shattered again and again and then the second year it's when I feel that God began to rebuild me\nAnd a lot of that happened uh just what small victories\nA big uh declaring truth declaring that God is with me uh I think of as a fifty ten became averse for me where a boy were walking in the dark we hold on to our God so I felt that I was walking in the dark and uh\nIt was a time when I began to rebuild missile I wrote a song or I'm declaring has a lot for me and his faithfulness and especially focusing on the idea of endearing till the end and uh being faithful and that\nWell you certainly have been and and that's great see see I Know that we I remember in this very studio\nWhen we were first talking about those conditions are in the prison how cold it was on the number of people it was the people that this is a hundred year in Britain in any where it's not great but you can imagine in the country like turkey or it's these are pretty awful conditions\nYeah and let's say you know terrible condition and you know I was able to talk to Noreen and during the legal process you know I could give hope through what these steps are course we didn't know what Chuck humans do\nBut then as a Christian trying to get help ... you know even when you don't see it we have now the gods and now he's working and saying you know I Know that that was a hard process and when you're in a Turkish printing to see what's forgetting that can where's the help and that\nAnd that on Facebook says your testimonies incredible God Bless you pastor Brunson you want to go yeah I I was going to ask a pastor Brunson\nA question about the people he was in prison way it used to spend on ABC News\nBut the idea that it with some really rough people considering that you were so high profile\nI always wanted to underscore that to our us audience how high profile you weren't turkey like you said when the economy went bad when the two officials were saying should they blamed Andrew Brunson turkey ah they they made you have to be this kind of super spy in the Turkish media\nAnd then you get put into jail cells with people a predominantly Muslim or who have read a ... a pretty salacious things about you [noise]\nWell what happened is that\nUh at the beginning I was in high profile and they treated me they treated all of the other people are accused of being part of the coup attempt and being a part of the good line that's movement which say\nIt's basically an Islamic movement and so at the beginning of the difficulty I never complained about the physical conditions I was at a whether it was crowded or cold or food or anything like that it was more the\nOr whether it was crowded or cold or food or anything like that it was more that I was in prison [laughter] definitely and the truth is it a lot of the people I was in prison with a word choose to being part of the gulags movement and there are police officers or military or\nA ... they were just very strong Muslims and the most difficult thing for me during that time with the spiritual environment because they were all very committed\nVery strong some so there were constant prayers going on recitation of the Koran that was like a Muslim ... prayer twenty four seven uh and I was only Christian and I had no fellowship or\nAnyone to pray with so the the spiritual environment was difficult as I became more ... higher profile after President Trump asked for me at the summit that he had made two thousand Seventeen then I'm within a couple of months they moved me from that sell\nTo a maximum to a higher security prison that I had been in a and put me in a smaller so with with just a two other people and the reason they did that was to provide more security so that people would not hurt me in any way so nothing what happened\nRight let's go right to the phones were holding on to talk to your pastor Brunson Laura in North Carolina online find Laura welcome to Jason you'll live\nThank you I Want to thank you I really do a little nervous hair era humble [noise] um [noise] and\nThank you for what you know I'm so glad that you're back home I mean they're praying for you than not we ... we saw that come up I\nSigned the thing on line that that petition online and was not ...\n... or ... down and praying with uh our president\nYou let me ask you about that let me ask you about that one uh Andrew that was quite a moment I mean I'm I've been in that room on on many occasions but that was certainly a different one what was your sense of that I mean I Know you wanted to do it you you prayed about it and I'm obviously the president was receptive ... have been a little bit about that\n... had a dream about praying for President Trump a and specifically praying or words of Isaiah where a police spirit by eleven\nAnd and her dream she uh she felt like there was resistance to that she had the press through that that it was an important thing to do\nSo she determined that if there was an opportunity to any point she met the president to pray these versus over him and when we learned that we would be going to the house the White House we prayed together and we ask God to give us the opportunity to pray for the president\nWe believe in prayer we believe also and and partition that as we pray for people got can\nA pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on and so we we ask God to give us an opportunity when we asked the president and if we pray for him he was very receptive and it was a great privilege for us to do this\nLet's say one more call before the break here Julie California on line six Julie you're on the pastor Bronx ideally\nI encountered in Dr ... because of all that's why I'm a member of the the L K they care about one individual and they care about is that the whole world\nAnd pass to burn burn my question is pitching field prayers people around the world prank Cleveland concern it's hard to lift up her friend Corey\nOK so first I Want to tell you something about it so they said they they care about the individual and so my wife told me how cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day goes through a whole day at work\nAnd just the personal care there was a really phenomenal ah ah the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know no no the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for me one of the fears that I had it's an irrational think perhaps\nBut when one one that's isolated the way I was is it would be forgotten that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that per because I I felt very weak and so\nAt I look back uh on my second year one God was rebuilding me\nI didn't feel God's presence very much\nBut ah I I Know very well that it was a ... of God's people that was a there with a grace coming to me that often was not felt it was like a hit and grace\nAnd I wasn't aware of it at that time but then I I Would look back and say well I came through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right and we're taking a break we'll come back with Sandra ... runs the moment but interesting statement\nWhen you said where you felt like you were alone and they were those times we we've had other cases during where people say the exactly the thing was they feel even though it's irrational they know it's a rational need those situations there can be completely forgot\nI Will be back with more than Andrew Brunson did just a moment\nIt's a critical time more nations in the world\nSo many challenges facing our country we're going to be American Center for launch has never been more and more of them\nWere engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom and\nYou can become a member of the ... sign up right now we don't\nCame out here but we're went up and I should I mean even three weeks ago I said some months ago I guess I said something about that we were encouraging the winter and they said and I think one of the reporters one of the magazine financial magazines maybe and CNBC I'm not sure said a secular made the statement and the lira came up select sleep which was absurd in one sense\nBut it tells you how tied into the geopolitical do people donors this was a NATO ally ... almost made it more\nComplex right and it didn't make it more complex I want people to also realize that we never had an minister ancient engaged like that so bad precedent it worse I think being quick it's because we had an inspiration State Department as Congress fully understand\nIf president that was going against and paying to send it to the house right\nYeah I mean on the human ... I was gonna say the single biggest reason that this case ended in a positive manner and a quick reason is because of the most powerful nation in the world spoke with one voice in of course\nThat was under the leadership of President Trump it authorized the vice president the secretary of state down the administrator of the executive branch or to do so but Jay then you look at the impact in the United States Senate very bipartisan very biking ... Jean Jean from New Hampshire who doesn't agree with the president on a lot of things one of the most vocal in the United\nStates and it looked like a free pass it runs in and and the staff was very helpful to let's go ahead and take another call passive back Julie's calling from Washington state on line to Julie welcome to Jay sexual live you're talking to pass the rents are Julie go ahead\nOh praise the lord has standards and um then praying to song the beginning of\nThe ear plug in your hand in there and has some gratifying\nFinding encouraging and I'm Wondering about the uh missionary about to go in there that are in their own why even say to 'em about that and what about the people that you are listening to them then how can we continue to pray for them those people that you may be spoken to their lives\nFar he was just a witness to I think he's still very much God Bless you\nFor your call Julie so it's a good question pastor one is advice for those that are there and and also those that are left behind that that you minister to\nVote one reality for people who are going at the missions and I but not just for missions I think are increasingly here in the states is it there is going to be a price to pay\nTo stand for truth and ah it's actually something very normal and the Bible is through that that we can expect opposition and that there will be persecution\nAnd so it's not just for missionaries but for people in the states as well as they stand for God and that society they're going to be people who will ah persecute a four\nFoot with the second part of the questions\nThat you want to know what are those that are are still there doing missionary work or what advice would you have for them\nAnd K\nType I think here's here's here's what you really trying to get to their armed people there in Turkey right now that we know are sharing the gospel we know that you were arrested for sharing the gospel you were charged with crushes them when we got an indictment and read it and it said Christians Asian as a form of terrorism we we all say that was absurd\nBut newer people you were measuring too that were impacted by your ministry and turkey are their shepherd to take care of them they're\nOkay yes and are are part of a yes\nOr how how do we also are pray for people who who\nYou know this ah right now there is increasing as long as they said that in the country and ah there we're seeing something very interesting that wasn't happening two years ago is now there are many people coming into the church and saying I Am no longer wanting to be some time now at this\nSo I'm believe in God but I don't I I Want to know how do I find him so I think there are increasing numbers of people and that's just something that God is going to use difficulties in the country I think that\nAre in the ... and and this time I had as as they become more difficult for the church in Turkey a effort people in general that more and more people will turn away from Islam and we'll begin to turn a blow to look for ... you know\nLet's go ahead more questions Brian calling from Arizona on line for Ryan welcome to the broadcast you're talking to pastor Brunson I ride\nA yes thank you thank you so much and a pastor Brunson that prayer was just so humble and symbols which made it so powerful um when you do that with the president is my question um you you brought the Holy Spirit up and I was just wondering you know when Jesus\nLeft he said I leave you an advocate you were not an orphan and I'm sure that that uh you felt like in orphans\nAt times during that a jail sentence and I was just wondering where one of the bigger doubts that transform a weakness to his strengths using this spirit that was a revelation for you in a crisis\nWell I I you know at some point I'm going to write a book and I go into this because they're actually complicated questions\nBut I questioned ah God's personal love for me faithfulness\nUh why he would leave me in a situation like this when I Love him and have dedicated to serving him and and these are questions at the heart\nMore than the mind sometimes just from the emotions and I found that I had to declare the truth and so I wrote a song in prison and one of the lines of Jesus the faithful one who loves me always good and true so that was a declaration of the things that I was doubting\nAnd I determined it doesn't matter what I feel or what my doubts are I Am going to speak the truth about gods character and that's just part of the some of the victories that I had step by step and ... and restoring strength to me was a declaring truth declaring God's character\nLet's go ahead and take John's call and when I think we can get this done before the break hey John calling from Minnesota you're on the air with ... John quickly please\nBalls that I just want to say that I didn't get to the heart of America are not very many people are the ... the president to say about this last year so I'll end up just loves to play for you in the in the future for you\nSo I'll end up just loves to play for you in the in the future you why why why they ask you one question what can you say to the persecuted church in Florida

the folks what you would be how long have you been there and what you were doing\nIn Turkey what was your call to go there\nWell we were there for twenty three years before I was arrested and our main goal was to uh go and priests to this Christ one of the main things we were involved in was church planting we're of all that several church plants\nAnd then in the last couple of years\nWhen there was a third of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attacks since area a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity not only to show the love of Jesus by helping them a humanitarian aid but also people who never had access to the gospel most Kurds have never met a Christian\nStanding with us you can make a tremendous difference in our country hand or culture\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAnd he's the OJ member today it's easy to just go online and sign up you know Jay on\n\nWhen we're joined by pastor Andrew Brunson were throw that happened the first time we've had him on a radio broadcasts\nObviously just out of a turkey and we're glad that he's home in the United states having said that I Know pastor your heart though is for the for the people of turkey and I'm sure that has not changed\nBut no we we still love turkey got this ... years ago and we are expecting that there will be a great artist in Turkey\nYep so you talked about the first year you said you were broken in January ... we've covered ear extensively you had a ... you were in a jail with twenty two people that was originally designed for eight or you had very harsh conditions are talking about the second year\nYeah so the first or feel like I was broken down and a shattered again and again and then the second year it's when I feel that God began to rebuild me\nAnd a lot of that happened uh just what small victories a big uh declaring truth declaring that God is with me\nUh I think of as a fifty ten became averse for me where a one were walking in the dark we hold on to our God\nSo I felt that I was walking in the dark and uh it was a time when God began to rebuild me slowly I wrote a song or I'm declaring has a lot for me and his faithfulness and especially focusing on the idea of endearing till the end and uh being faithful and that\nWell you certainly have been and and that's great see see I Know that we I remember in this very studio\nWhen we were first talking about those conditions are in the prison how cold it was on the number of people it was the people that this is an ear to Britain in anywhere is not great but you could imagine in a country like turkey or it's these are pretty awful conditions\nYeah it was very you know terrible condition and you know I was able to talk to you Noreen and during the legal process do you not to get help through what these steps are of course we didn't know what he was going to do\nThan as a Christian trying to get help ... you know even when you don't see it we have now the gods and now he's working in saying you know I Know the hard process and when you're in a Turkish printing to see what's the debt in that scene where so in that\nAnd that on Facebook says your testimonies incredible God Bless you passed the Bronx and you want to go yeah I I was going to ask a pastor Brunson a question about the people he was in prison when I used to spend on ABC News\nBut the idea that with some really rough people considering that you were so high profile\nI always wanted to underscore that to our us audience how high profile you weren't turkey like you said when the economy went bad when the two officials were saying should they blamed Andrew Brunson in Turkey or that they made you have to be this kind of super spy in the Turkish media\nAnd then you get put into jail cells with people a predominantly Muslim or who have read a ... a pretty salacious things about you\n[noise] well what happened is that\nUh at the beginning I wasn't high profile and they treated me they treated all of the other people are accused of being part of the coup attempt and being a part of the gay line that's movement which say it's basically an Islamist movement\nAnd so at the beginning of the difficulty I never complained about the physical conditions I was in\nA whether it was crowded or cold or food or anything like that it was more that I was\nWhether it was crowded or cold or food or anything like that it was more that I was in prison [laughter] I'm deathly and the truth is that a lot of the people I was in prison with a word cube of being part of the Gila movement and there are police officers or military or\nA ... they were just very strong Muslims and the most difficult thing for me er during that time was a spiritual environment because they were all very committed very strong listen so there were constant prayers going on reputation of the Koran that was like a Muslim ... prayer twenty four seven\nUh and I was only Christian and I had no fellowship or\nAnyone to pray with so the the spiritual environment was difficult as I became more ... higher profile after President Trump asked for me at the summit that he hadn't made two thousand Seventeen than a than a couple of months they moved me from that sell\nTo a maximum to a higher security prison than I had been in a and put me in a smaller so with with just a two other people and the reason they did that was to provide more security so that people would not hurt me in any way so nothing what happened\nRight let's go right to most people are holding on to talk to pass the Bronx and Laura in North Carolina online find Laura welcome to Jason alive\nHey thank you I just want to thank you I really do a little nervous if it's your humble [noise] um [noise] and ah\nThank you for what you what you are you know I'm so glad that you're back I mean then praying for you\nThan not we can solve that come up I signed the thing on line that that they should not wind was not ... no\n[laughter] yeah incredible ... a nail down and praying for with uh our president\nYou let me ask you about that let me ask you about that one uh Andrew that was quite a moment I mean I'm I've been in that room on on many occasions but then that was certainly a different one what was your sense of that I mean I Know you wanted to do it you you prayed about it and I'm obviously the president was receptive tells me a little bit about that\n... had a dream about praying for President Trump a and specifically praying or words of Isaiah ... Holy Spirit by eleven\nAnd and her dream she uh she felt like there was resistance to it and she had the press through it that it was an important thing to do so she determined that if there was an opportunity to any point she met the president to pray these versus over him and when we learned that we would be going to the house the White House\nWe prayed together and we ask God to give us the opportunity to pray for the president we believe in our prayer we believe\nAlso and importation that as we pray for people got can\nA pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on\nAnd so we we ask God to give it set up er tentative when we asked the president if we could pray for him he was very receptive\nAnd it was a great privilege for us to do this\nLet's say one more call before the break here Julie California on line six Julie you're on the air with pastor Brunson Julie\nI'm gay and Oregon after parent can custom all that's why I don't remember the hail today because they care about one individual and they care about that since the ... the whole world\nAnd passed up on her my question is pitching feel occur are so people around the world prank clean one person it's how how ... works for him to court e\nOkay so first I Want to say something about it so they said they they care about the individual and so my wife told me how cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day go through a whole day at work\nAnd just the personal care there was a really phenomenal uh uh the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know no no the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for me one of the fears that I had it's an irrational think perhaps but when one is isolated the way I was is it I Would be forgotten that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that per because I I felt very weak\nAnd so uh as I look back uh on my second year of one guard was rebuilding me\nI didn't feel God's presence very much\nBut uh I I Know very well that it was a personal God's people that was a\nThere was a grave coming to me that often was not felt right it was like a hit and grace and I wasn't aware of it at the time but then I I Would look back and see well I came through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right in by we're taking a break we'll come back with Sandra ... runs the moment but interesting statement when you said where you felt like you were alone and there were those times we we've had other cases where people say the exactly the same exact\nDay feel even though it's irrational they have no it's a rational need those situations there can be completely forgot I Will be back with more Andrew Brunson did just a moment\nIt's a critical time for nation in the world is so many challenges facing our country in the world to be American Center for Long Jones has never been more and more of them right now\nWe're engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family members and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional one religious freedom and\nYou can become a member of the the OJ on line up right now we see no during during\nCame out earlier when the lira went up and I should I mean even three weeks ago I said I'm a month ago I guess I said something about that we were encouraging the later they said and I think one of the reporters one of the ... of the financial magazines maybe CNBC I'm not sure said a secular made the statement and the lira came up selectively which was absurd in one sense\nBut it tells you how tied into the geopolitical do people donors this was a NATO ally with almost made it more complex right and it didn't make it more complex\nI Want people to also realize is that we've never had in many strengthening dates like that so bad precedent it worse I think being quick is because we had an inspiration State Department as Congress fully understand\nIf president was bleeding against and paying to send it\nTo the house right yeah I mean on a human ... I was gonna say the single biggest reason that this case ended in a positive manner and a quick reason is because of the most powerful nation in the world spoke with one voice in of course that was under the leadership of President Trump made authorized the vice president the secretary of state down the administrator or the executive branch\nOr to do so but Jay then you look at the impact in the United States Senate very bipartisan very biking really means yeah Jean Jean from New Hampshire who doesn't agree with the president on a lot of things one of the most vocal advocates in the United\nStates Senate ... Bronson and staff was very helpful to All right let's go ahead and take another call pastors back a Julie's\nCalling from Washington state on line to Julie welcome to Jay sexual live you're talking to a pastor Brunson Hi Julie go ahead\nOh praise the lord has standards and um then praying to what song is the beginning of the airplane and your name in there and it's so gratifying\nEncouraging and I'm Wondering about the uh missionary and about to go in there that are in there on what you can say to 'em about that and what about the people\nThat you are listening to them and how can we continue to pray for them\nThose people that you may be spoken to their lives far he were just a witness to I think he's still very much God Bless you\nFor your call Julie such a good question pass or one of his advice for those that are there and and also those that are left behind that that you minister to\nVote one reality for people who are going into ... says and I but not just for missions I think are increasingly here in the states\nThat there is going to be a price to pay a to stand for truth\nAnd ah it's actually something very normal and the Bible is through the that we can expect opposition and that there will be persecution\nAnd so it's not just for missionaries but for people in the states as well as it stands for God and that society they're going to be people who will ah persecute a for what was the second part of the questions\nThat you want to know what I'm for those that are are still there doing missionary work or what advice would you have rhythm\nOkay\nI I think here's the IRS that well here's what she's really trying to get to their armed people there in Turkey right now that we know are sharing the gospel we know that you were arrested for sharing the gospel you were charged with crushes Asian when we got an indictment and rent it and it said Christians Asia as a form of terrorism we we all say that was absurd\nBut there were people you were mastering too that were impacted by your ministry in Turkey are their shepherd to take care of them they're\nA okay yes and are are part of a yes or how how do we also are pray for people who who\nYou know this ah right now there is increasing as long as they send in the country and uh there were seeing something very interesting that wasn't happening two years ago this now there are many people coming into the church and saying I Am no longer wanting to be among some I'm now at this\nSo I'm believe in God but I don't I I Want to know how do I find him so I think there are increasing numbers of people and this is something that God is going to use difficulties in the country I think that\nAre in the ... and and this time I had as as things become more difficult for the church in Turkey a ... for people in general that more and more people will turn away from Islam and we'll begin to turn a well to look for ... yeah\nAll right let's go ahead more questions Brian calling from Arizona on line for Ryan welcome to the broadcast you're talking to pass the Bronx I ride\nA yes thank you thank you so much and a pastor Brunson that prayer was just so humble and symbols which made it so powerful um when you do that with the president [noise] my question um you you block the Holy Spirit up there and I was just wondering you know when Jesus\nLeft he said I leave you an advocate you were not an orphan and I'm sure that that uh you felt like in or friends\nAt times during that a jail sentence and I was just wondering where one of the bigger doubts that transform a weakness to his strength using the spirit that was a revelation for you in a crisis\nWell I I you know at some point I'm going to write a book and I go into this because they're actually complicated questions but I questioned ah\nGod's personal love for me faithfulness or why he would leave me in a situation like this when I Love him at a dedicated in my life to serving him and ... and these are the\nQuestions at the heart more than of the mind sometimes just from the emotions\nAnd I found that I had to declare the truth and so I wrote a song in prison and one of the lines of Jesus the faithful one who loves me always good and true so that was a declaration of the things that I was doubting\nAnd I determined it doesn't matter what I feel or what my doubts are I Am going to speak the truth about gods character and this was part of the the some of the victories that I had step by step in and and restoring strength to me was a declaring truth declaring God's character\nLet's go ahead and take John's calling when we can get us and before the break John calling from Minnesota you're on the air with pastor braids on quickly please\nBalls that I just want to say that I think it captures the heart of America are not very many people there ... there were a president to say about his costs are so I just lost to play for you in the in the theater for you\nSo I'll end up just loves to play for you in the in the future you why why why they ask you one question what can you say to the persecuted church in Florida so that you know national day up so that by quest to do last July cost to\nWhat about you what would you be your word to the persecuted church pastor\nBut there's very little that I can say that the church in China they're the ones who teach us but what I Do know that God is going to use China to bless the world and they are the next big missions sending there's going to be a wave of Chinese going out into the Muslim world\nAnd they are going to carry much of the weight of the missionary movement so I expect great wonderful things from China\nWere coming up on the last segment with pastor Brunson so I encourage you to keep going keep getting your comments in France said I
