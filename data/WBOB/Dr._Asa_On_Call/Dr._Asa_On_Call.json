the ... the state with may as well 'cause that [noise] I think you can help me understand a fan of what's happening in America project that I'm working on a\nGreat\nJob on by tied to the gym yeah essentially wanting to know what state sales but the last couple of years is a Donald Trump in office and find out what people are thinking\nOut by the judge he if he is the main issue with aids and they tend to elections and adults of what it means for the white politicians go about speaking to an electorate out to\nA camp by any twenty six thing that that changed so much about American politics and and so it was really interested to speak with you and find out to get a sense of how your audience say those things and and ah I guess ... not the case in Virginia as well\n[noise] okay well there's two issues James one is Virginia and when is national so the Trump policies the Trump America First policies and his administration\nAre not been can do serve to Republicans get elected statewide in Virginia\nAt one of the reasons for that is the number the growing number of federal employees that live in Virginia and work in Washington DC for the federal government the Trump Administration has not seen by federal workers as friendly to them as you know he's just asked for a five percent\nAcross the board reduction in all agencies which means jobs he also called for a pay freeze for federal workers because of the debt that we have\nSo Virginia is an anomaly than the tremendous numbers of people living in northern Virginia that are not Trump\nSo Porter is basically dominate the state and so that's why it has gone democratic and so the northern Virginia area it really makes it tough for\nTrump's Republican Party to win state wide now in other parts of the state of Virginia they are doing five south West Virginia southern Virginia or the shore area are they all have Republicans elected there and we expect all of them\nTo get reelected James nationally\nIt's very different nationally it is very different and what this president has done in these midterms which is very different from status quo when you know we use the great disruptor as he's barn stormed the country\nQuote when you know we use the great disruptor as he's barn stormed the country and he's made this midterm election a referendum\nOn his administration on his America First policies on the Trump autonomy on trade and on the success of these ads and basically he said if you\nWant jobs you vote for me if you want a country you vote for me if you want mobs and caravans you vote for them and so he is\nReally made this a simple choice and he's gotten in the states where many races are tied and right now twelve days out what looked like three months ago almost certain that Democrats would take control the house\nIt is now tied that's up for grabs I put it that fifty fifty three months ago it was like eighty five Fifteen everybody thought\nThe Republicans would win control and some people actually thought they had a chance to win the United States Senate that's not happening either Republicans are going to gain big there that tied with twelve days is starting to turn Trump's why James\nSo I'm really interested Johnson to understand the difference in the east side of that in the junior and what did the state than it is that because\nOne of the prices that are ... interesting in in things like what you're talking about the Donald Trump making these men tend to that himself he's in ... states represent to a\nWhen you have a good job and you feel secure in your job\nAnd you can bring money into put food on the table and support your family and by your son baseball shoes or\nYour daughter and New Jersey dress for dance or take them to a movie on a Saturday Night that's what you're for it doesn't matter whether you're a Republican or Democrat crack or\nThis or that that's driving Trump's popularity it's jobs it's economic prosperity its economic growth and it's being positive about what the future holds\nBecause many say that as many say some of the things that took care of and for example as as far\nAs what James\nWhere a lot of his opponents say like look at the ... on the caravan for example is as appealing to feel rather than positivity\nWell one ten thousand\nIllegal migrants are coming to invade your country how are you supposed to react you supposed to be excited about that\nI mean first of all we're a country of laws the laws are getting flaunted we have an open borders situation and so when ten thousand or seven thousand or a thousand\nIllegal aliens come in statistics show\nThat Ninety nine percent of them because of our stupid laws that the Democrats had been in favor of Ninety nine percent of them ended up staying in the United states now have you come in illegally and you stay in the U.S here's what happens you wind up in school\nSo you take resources that's number one the second thing that happens is\nYour a low skilled worker therefore you drive down wages\nSo you're not getting Fifteen dollars an hour like you should in the United states like companies should pay wages start dropping\nBecause you were flooded the market with access cheap labor so wages go down pay goes down\nAnd then if you've got two people competing for a job and one will take seven dollars an hour seven twenty five and the other one wants to wells who gets the job the one that was seven twenty five and that's the illegal so this is not a positive and what the president in a citizen of\nThe some of the ... and ... to ... and and something that they would cause as well you know they [noise]\nLike very ... and some of these ... was saying look we simply would not be able to operate without spending so many of them in that town initially illegally in life and I both to find a way to obtain a base at all but\n... who had come initially and they was that was certainly a strong on the standing\nOn the Republican side amongst a number of devices and and people that I spoke to the value of the ... of of having migrant workers who are paid to do jobs that they said they simply could not get Americans to do\nThen do it legally James and go through our visa application process and do it legally and then once you legal guess what you got to pay taxes you're part of the U.S jobs system\nAnd then you have to go back when your visa expires let me ask you something James if a a caravan of ...\nIs it expires ... something James if a a caravan of ships right now\nFrom Guatemala were selling into Sydney, Australia ten thousand of them and they just want jobs and\nWho knows who was in the Caribbean James some of them could be terrorists who knows rights could be human traffickers are better than there no one knows could be anybody but somebody funded them\nAnd fifty ships land in Sydney and they say look we just want asylum but Australian farmers you know they're going to be happy because they can pay us five dollars an hour and we'll\nDo while they're farming and clean their hotel rooms or whatever and so uh what was the reaction would be the Australian government would they'd be like sure come on in the world for all all for one we got plenty of money here or would they send them back James\nOr the the tower describing government would would most it and they did that to do on the\n[noise] the by the immigration in stride as saying a similarly fiercely ride gene was to for many years and a lot of it and his wife has done on very similar she ... the U.S close our\nBorders are in the woods that national anthem could buy the south a little bit more of a hurdle but certainly the issue was a ... a asylum\nSeeking loads of a papal coming on boats down from South Asia south east Asia as being a a a major [noise]\nAnd I just sticking plenty and strategy in politics as well for quite a while and I think it sort of thing and it goes in many ways to sort of what my destination what Easter people's destination is with with what happens in America because\nEvery one of the west the will of the Democratic well do the has has oh what a long look to America's at the lie on the hill and hitting a ton\nTo many of the debate which uh which is not unique to America at that which are important to buy a democracy the world either and at and and and the the interest in in what has changed in and says the influences which is shaping American politics today\nSo in Australia you've passed laws that basically except illegal immigrants on a skill and merit basis for instance if ... has a need for pipe sitters\nAnd there's a pipe fitter is in Somalia that apply to come to Australia and the Australian government knows that if they let them in and they go through the proper legal Australian paperwork that they're going to get a job as a pipe fitter and contribute to the Australian economy they let them it\nThat makes a lot of sense that's the kind of laws the U.S needs\nA merit based skill based system where if we determine economically that we have a need for a certain skill or for a certain job then regardless of where those immigrants might be from\nThey get to the top of the list because we're not saying we don't want him in Prince or we don't want migrants or we don't want people coming into the United states what President Trump is saying is we want them to come in and be able to get a job to come in legally and be able to contribute\nTo the betterment of society not come in go on welfare not have a skill get a phone get housing\nGet food get food stamps and overwhelm a local school system that doesn't make any sense right no country can ... if you do that\nYou basically don't have a country you have basically a massive land and eventually you go bankrupt the United states has a Twenty one trillion dollar debt\nThe policy of just open borders and letting anybody in because we happened to be really good people no longer makes any sense otherwise James no borders you don't have a country\nAnd I I mean I can certainly understand what the ... have that appeal to\nDevices I guess the the interesting side effect is\nTrying to understand what that means intensive like a ball that appeals to nice places what people think when they when they say does what sort of sentiments and emotion instead of I think has a [noise]\nEven listening to the Democratic politics now try to understand by the way that that got Raul waited I guess that role in twenty six saying that they were entirely blind to\nThe appeal of Donald Trump and his appeal to the working class [noise]\nIt's really interesting to try and understand Sybil which messages appeal and and I I'm\nKind of interested as well to to to ask you if you if you feel the Democratic party has learned anything from twenty six day and and what you observed by state and local races in it at a national level what are they doing differently I learned anything do you think\nNo didn't learn nothing that you just look at the policies that they've been acted if you look at the national democratic agenda right now\nDo you have any idea what they stand for or what they're attempting to do other than the hate Trump do you have any idea do they have a single policy\nNo they're going to impeach Trump and roll back the biggest tax cut in history\nAnd they're going to open up the borders and they're going to increase sanctuary cities in a whole bunch of them want to get rid of the only law enforcement organization we have cold ice that's the acronym in order to really move illegal so the Democratic policies are\nGoing to be two million dollars a year it's spent on food assistance programs like food stamps wake and free school lunches for illegal criminal aliens\nTo point five billion dollars a year instead of the Medicare for illegal criminal aliens\n... billion dollars a year it's spent on primary and secondary school education for children here illegally and they still cannot even speak English John seven million dollars a year and then for education for the American born children of illegal criminal aliens also known as anchor babies\nThree million dollars and day it's going to incarcerate illegal criminal aliens\nThirty percent of all federal prison inmates are illegal criminal aliens\nNineteen billion dollars a year and spend it on a little pleading for welfare and social services by the American taxpayers\nHundred million dollars a year and breast American wages\nAre caused by the illegal criminal aliens on housing and six illegal criminal aliens how I'm forty five million dollars and Ramadan says to their countries of origin\nWhen you add all this cost up this is a whopping three hundred and thirty eight point three million dollars a year\nOut of your pocket the my pocket our children's pocket and everyone listening to us right now\nAnd I encourage everyone listening if you want to understand more about the problem we are dealing with\nAnd go to the nearest book Barnes and noble store and buy my book rise rise in defense of Judeo Christian values and freedom because we are losing our country before our very eyes also for more information on that stuff\nPeople can go to our organization's website pack for America dot org\nBack for America dot org we named the organization act for America and I think America now which for America now how for America and I pray for America\nBut for America because you can do all that but if you don't take any action nothing happens\nFor America today is the largest

got twelve days in the midterms you vote Republican you're voting for jobs you\nVoting for economic prosperity you voting for a continuation of the America First policies led by Donald J Trump you vote for the Democrats are voting for mob and Taliban that's it and you want to turn the clock back on the tax cuts and everything else\nNow what you're gonna have to do or through the next twelve days\nOr say polls because now we have a new system in the United states ladies and gentlemen you know it's big news is now we have big poles we're big polls to drive fake news\nTo draw the conclusion let me say it again in the next\nTwelve days be very wary of what the legacy media is going to do here's what the legacy media is going to continue to do the New York times\nCNN\nThe fake news said polls\nDriving fake news for fake narrative for a fake inclusion it's all fake\n\nAnd you've got to get the food's right here from your ... of the truth in America and that's me once CNN puts a poll out showing\nMayor Gillum and Florida up by twelve boys override the Sanders and he's a socialist that is absurdity beyond belief that sort of real poll none of these polls are real\nNot one of them are real they did this do you do thousand sixteen and they're going to do it again\nAnd these are not polls to disseminate legitimate information these are polls to drive a result so you're going to get from the legacy media fake news with fake polls\nTo drive the fake narrative to get a fake inclusion and here's what they want you to do they're going to continue to tell you and lie to you with these polls are they take with fake metrics than false information these are pushed falls\nTo trying to get a result and here's what you're going to get\nYou going to get a constant drumbeat for the next world they just like they did in November two thousand sixteen saying there's a blue wave coming in the Democrats are going to win a hundred seats the generic numbers of widened to Fifteen all the Republicans are the press don't bother to work\nDon't hear that a flyer don't knock on doors don't make phone calls don't do anything because look the polling numbers show the Republicans are cook\nAnd so why waste your time go enjoy the weekend the a football game and have a beer that's what they want you to do they don't want you to work they don't want you to get involved they don't want you to be enthusiastic so they're going to lie to you with fake polls driving fake news to get a fake narrative\nAnd at the end of the day they want to fake inclusion drawn\nSo they can get their own sake result polls by these legacy fake news yours\nNo longer to disseminate legitimate information and inform the public they are done to drive a narrative\nGentlemen information and inform the public they are done to drive a narrative to buttress whatever result they want\nAnd so that's why I've been telling you for weeks you just take one district and that's the tempted Virginia just one and I've been telling you for weeks Barbara Comstock is either tighter ahead and she's going to win that race out finally a poll comes out showing a tide finally some legit poll somewhere\nAll the other fake news polls\nShowed her down by Fifteen\nAnd I knew for a fact that was not true same thing now they're showing spanberger ahead in the seventh fake they're showing coal burning ahead a recommended a fifth regiment is going to win that race by double digits\nThey wanted the press Republican turnout and depressed or volunteers and they do this by lying to you\nOr we're beyond fake news now\nNow we have networks of the legacy media that won't even report certain news items if they think it's going to interfere with their narrative talking points of the day which is to defeat trumpet the Republicans\nAnd look I Know there's a lot of Republicans out there that drive you nuts and you don't want to vote for them and they voted this way or they voted that way they didn't do this or they didn't do that or there was some in fight or a primary fight or a few going on\nYou got twelve days\nHere's my thing let's unite now let's keep the house Republican\nLet's build the Republican majority in the U.S Senate so President Trump then continue his phenomenal America First policies and keep this country moving ahead what we do that on November seventh then we can fight again let's wait now fight later\nOh I don't like this one because he didn't he beat cancer okay whatever go fight with Dave later oh I don't like Scott Taylor cause he beat Randy Forbes I fight with him later oh I don't like Barbara cushy voted this way or that way\nSo I'm going to vote no I'm going to vote for nobody or I'm going to vote libertarian or I'm going to stay home it's ridiculous\nRight now what Trump if you're a Trump supporter Trump needs a Republican majority period doesn't matter who it is and he's a Republican majority\nYou want to pick your petty fights and we all have them I get it do it later\nThere's a lot of people not getting on my show that I have few did with and you know who they are not going to mention their names and they come on now every single week why because we've got to bring everybody together get everybody on the same page for twelve days and when this election\nBecause we are we are we're working against\nHundreds of million dollars in swat money hundreds of millions of dollars from the Hollywood crazy left wing hers and the entire fake news legacy media network which has aligned now behind the Democrats\nAnd so that's what you're finding so fake news is out there and I'm\nGoing to say it again you're going to get fake polls which is fake news to drive the fake narrative to get a fake inclusion and the end game is to get the result they want which is Democrats to take power so they can do what roll back the tax cuts impeached Trump\nYou ... you were two thousand Eighteen ...

and you continue [noise] ah\nTo improve your financial situation or something like that goes on and says what are the three things you should ask yourself number one do I spend all my salary every month number to do I have six months worth of expenses in emergency savings fund\nAnd number three others were his number three oh\n\nGosh oh do I have to have retirement shame he got cut off the end of the page do I have a retirement savings\nSo if you look at what they're asking them do I spend every penny of what I make I came up with three questions you should ask yourself are you say the least twenty five to fifty percent of what you are going to do that and say you can't do that okay look I got kids living right here\nThey lived with us up until they're in their late twenties in fact one of the kids still lives with her dad and\nShe's in her late twenties you're living at home you have no bills\nRight\nYou have a job she has a job she makes good money and she sees quite a bit of it she got quite a bit of money saved up she doesn't want to admit it because she's embarrassed that none of our other friends have any money because they spend every dime they make\nWhen you were in that situation no matter where you are life you start somewhere where we have very little overhead if you don't raise your overhead that first paycheck you get a hundred percent more than what you had the day before you could start with fifty percent savings plan right that\nEasily just like the guy saying if you get a raise that raises you don't have it right now you could save half of that race\nIf you can only afford twenty five percent as you go out and buy assets and they start to increase in income that pass if it's on the outside of what you have right\nYou need none of that because you had none of it so every dime of what you earn passively should be saved so now you've got you're saving twenty five percent of your paycheck and every dime of what you make that we now have your total net worth your seven closer to fifty percent\nWith that kind of ratio and with re investments you're going to be a millionaire and no time at all second question you ask yourself is how much passive income to the last year how much more am I going to earn this year\nThe mount a passive income blows my mind when asked people okay everybody room please write down how much passive income you have and they all just looked at me like black like uh I don't know to be how do you have no passive income\nWhere in the world can Ninety five percent of the people in this country not

savings and retirement accounts\nThere just saving\nAnd turning very little return even though they're doing the other two things right they're saving right you know they're working the earnings are saving\nTheir not managing the returns and the returns of people are seeing when they do this test me in my class are so low it's frightening less than one percent for most people not more than five

I don't care if this journalist or Muslim Brotherhood I don't care who is allies for I don't care what bin Laden\nIt's relevant and he cannot conduct himself if he wants to be a western society ... chatty rabies modernizing frankly NBS one Saudi Arabia to modernize economically young so he can stay in power the same way\nThat Trump is trying to deal with Kim Jong il gave up new can joke about

Saudi constantly than this damn bowl but you know come out now they say well maybe it was rogue murder that he went in for interrogation but there's no official statement\nComing from king Salman who denies the whole thing and now the Saudis threatening other there was any sanctions or they're going to retaliate and disrupt the world's economy and shoot up oil prices ... what the hell is going on here\nWell ah this individual who's not a judge lifted opinion piece friday's loaded American he was the original alien he's been caught up in the middle of a geopolitical competition\nBetween two Sunni nations who want to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that turkey which is becoming a new ought to him and his feel go see on the\n... and Saudi Arabia where Islam was founded in the seventh century of of this person was recorded in the middle of an individual who who if the reports all true about what happened to them didn't deserve what happened to him\nWas a very very shady character with a very close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood even to the bin Laden family I'm an individual who was the nephew of the biggest problems due to the twentieth century ... so it's it's basically an individual caught in the middle of a giant geo strategic competition\nSo the president's sending secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Riyadh to try to get to the bottom of this find out what happened obviously the Saudis the first day when they put out which was that this individual was there an hour got his paperwork and\nDeparted but they said the dog ate the cameras or something they couldn't produce the footage of that now they're changing\nTheir story how does this affect the U.S relationship with the Saudis as it relates to Mohammed bin Salman\nWell when we were in the White House uh we were very encouraged by the reforms NBS was initiating we we always used the term behavior modification Saudi Arabia had\nBeen in bed with the wrong people for far too long of key members of the elite had been funding and supporting a jihadi out the audio ... how the activists\nAround the world that was going on a very very positive Paul this is not what we expect from a nation that says it's recalling itself so Mike Pompeo is a tough guy I talked with a couple of his closet Westport over director who CIA\nHe will get to the bottom of it and if the reports turned out to be true about what happened to ... that will be a consequences for Saudi Arabia definitely the ... the arms trade or if my expectation\nTo think that this might affect the United states backing of the Saudi Emirates coalition and the Yemeni civil war said\nYes oh so the the big Big M muscle move but right now in the region is when we were in the beginning of the administration\nBut gee Sisi the Gulf Cooperation council turned its back on ... which is the worst offenders in the region when it comes to sponsoring radical Islamic groups that that's going to be the primary concern that we we we maintain pressure on ... and the G C C continues to\nTo behave in ways that that will lessen the impact will the importance of these radical groups on top of that ... that the ... the second of the ... uh uh order effects most important of all being Iran so you know that there is a balance in the region but\nThe instability in Lebanon and other major issues and\nSo this actually has the feeling of a potentially a watershed time in the relationship\nI think you're right and there's other issues as well the consolidation of power by\nNBS Mohammed bin Salman arresting all of what you might consider his potential rivals calling it corruption putting them in a hotel the administration look the other way on that I kind of got it their business or write the kind of went with it\nBut then you've also got the blonde Gulf\nBlood K they did against Qatar which really made no sense and it's because it's backfired on them because the nation of cutter is now better off than they were so that's backfired and blow up in their face now they're trying to\n... as you know ... you know there's challenges with cutter but has also the\nThe home of a major us air base of the all you need air force base in subtle rent and not have been able to prosecute the war against ISIS without being able to use that base a base on two occasions one so the the glass of nature of Saudi Arabia toilets auto a\nProsecution of a humanitarian disaster by most accounts in Yemen and these other instances and you know I think for a long time hey let's be blunt the basis of their relationship was that the United states needed right\nOff from Saudi Arabia that's less less the case in the United states now becomes a lot of energy ... for a job up our own energy sources\nAre in our need to rely on oil from Saudi Arabia and current are had the other direction on human rights issues on equal status of women a prosecution of political decisions dissidents et cetera and we don't have to turn our had any longer\nAnd I think now that and I tell you what I don't want this to become on how we navigate their way through it but as you know I'm In non intervention list and I'm a victim and Lee opposed to the\nOur involvement in supporting the Saudi Emirates\nCoalition and voting the civil war against the Yemen he's fifty thousand people dead people are starving children eating bark off trees I mean the thing is horrific\nWe've got the whole buses getting blown up with bombs and made in the u._s._a. I mean the whole thing is a disaster we shouldn't be there bomber got us in the president who as you know I'm a big supporter of campaign to get us out we're not out\nBut the other day this is interesting and I I just want your comment on this one of the strangest alliances of all time your colleague Lindsey Graham wants a muscular national response to everything as you know part of the new concept aligning himself with\nRand Paul the non interventionist in getting out of this war and Rand Paul saying he's going to bring it to a vote on the Senate floor how would that work and when would that be\n[noise] um we we are I'm John we're out and tell Veterans Day we'll be back in the day after Veterans Day and I think you're going to see a lame duck session like no other I think it can be extremely intense in November and December\nThere there are different ways is can come up for a vote 'em\nIn the Senate you know you one senator can sort of stop action on virtually anything until you get your way on something else so I think the two issues you'll see come up and you are right to point out when Lindsey Graham who's an interventionist says it's time for us to get out\nThat really tells you something about Rand has Rand Paul and I and Chris Murphy and others have been in the in the position of trying to block arms sales to stop activity in Yemen for a while but with Lindsay and others coming on board it does show that changed in a relationship so I think you'll see\nA for a vote on the Senate on one of two and maybe both you may see a floor vote on\nOn blocking arms sales and you may also see a floor vote on a stopping\nAny us support for the war in Yemen we were in Yemen battling ISIS and al ... there is an ISIS and al ... presidents of Yemen that then separate to that the civil war between the who sees and the Yemeni government started\nAnd us activity has sort of bled over from the battle against ISIS Zapata\nInto active participation on behalf of the Saudis and the civil war and I think it's time that we that we stopped at\nA let's move on Senator Tim Kaine with us here on the John ... radio network and he's running for election to a second term that will be decided on November sixes Republican opponent is Prince William county chairman of the board of supervisors Corey Stewart\nCenter the Honduras Guatemala caravan now up to four thousand people\nTraveling to the United states there want to come to the country illegally\nThese are not refugees for filing they're calling themselves economic refugees will senator there's four billion people around the globe that could be economic refugees that could find a better life in the United states\nAre you in favor of just four or five thousand people just walking over the border in this caravan and being absorbed into the U.S and if we do that what's to say the next one isn't going to be forty thousand or fifty thousand\nYeah no you know you're right John ... that we we have to have laws about who gets in and who doesn't and we have to have border security I have voted\nFor repeatedly has you know I was part of that group in the Senate in April I'm Sorry junior twenty Thirteen that passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill and in that bill folks often don't pay attention is in that bill\nWas forty billion dollars of border security over ten years President Trump is now asking for twenty five billion dollars in border security\nOver ten years or less than we originally included in the bill that we did\nWe we need comprehensive immigration reform or where I I mean I Am not for open borders and never have been we make we need to make sure we invest the um uh the money in the right way so uh when I worked I actually worked with Lindsey Graham in February we put it\nThe right way so when I worked for I actually worked with Lindsey Graham in February we put a deal on the table for the president that the deal was Mr President can you take yes for an answer\nThat deal involved protection for dreamers which the president had said Congress should do banned it involved the complete twenty five billion dollars\nThat the president had asked for over ten years with\nCongressional oversight to make sure it was spent right um but the president when we put the deal\nOut their trashed we at eight Democrats and Republicans the president could have accomplished something that he said that he would do when he ran for office and he chose to attack it because he wants to dramatically change family unification and the diversity visa program\nEt cetera but with respect to the care of and shouldn't be able to just\nCome in their state from Honduras from from Denmark or from anywhere there there have to be rules and they the rules and to be enforced and that's why it's time that we do a comprehensive immigration reform\nWell I think the president is open to Dr negotiation I mean I think he does realize that these are children in the United states they know they know no other place I think the real negotiating issue now becomes the president is adamantly opposed to the continuation of chain migration\nAnd he would prefer a um merit based economic system\nOf immigration like Canada or or stroll you has it basically says if we have a need for pipe sitters and there's ... in Somalia they go to the top of the line because if they immigrate to the United states are going to find a job so that's the issue that's going to have to get worked out as you guys go forward with this but and and\nJohn there may be a discussion I mean in\nThe lame duck I was talking about that earlier how many issues that are after um as you know we we avoid a government shutdown at such a phony and appropriations go I'm most of the major categories of government before the end of September that was good that the one\nI'm item we just did a continuing resolution to early December for continued discussion is on the border funding area so yeah we're going to have all between the\nElection in early December will have a major discussion with the polls and about that and he wants to border security money which we've been willing to vote for and we want reforms as well\nI'm ... and we'll we'll\nWe'll get into office cashing in the next month or so\nAs this caravan get through Mexico and gets to the southern border of the United states senator Kaine what should authorities do what should we do\nWell well first I mean let's let's not wait I'm getting to the watchers or not to the bottom allowing Mexican border yet so we need to work with a\nGovernment some Guatemala and Mexico I'm On this and you know I Hope that the president's especially you know often tough talk about Mexico et cetera does not hurt our ability to\nReach and a quarter was ... I think one\nOf the issues that's important is you gotta have allies in the world and and when you have allies you can work together on joint solution is the best thing is for the caravan of people in Honduras or or not even get to the border with the United states but that would involve the U.S having a cooperative relationship\nWith Mexico for example and not spending time trashing Mexico which the president an awesome does so I Know that a U.S military and north command which basically is everything north of the Mexican Guatemalan border\nWhere you were already\nAm six hundred WB you'll be

about marketing and a distribution and customer service\nAnd sales and really started working with dad when I was about twelve or fourteen so I really work with and all my life including when I was in high school up until the time that I was in college and then I worked for for about four years after college\nUp until the time that I was in college and then I worked for him for about four years after college and then he saw this business which kind of broke my heart but that got me going and I moved from El Paso to Dallas and changed careers and that's when I got into care sales\n[noise] so that's interesting so you you went from that that family business and\nThat really entrepreneurial paradigm which is is very different than working for for someone else what was that transition

I was working with my family\nAnd gosh living in Dallas Fort Worth and it was the least an hour and a half maybe even two hours round trip every day getting to and from\nWork so and then I had a boss that I recorded too and you know there's always that fear like oh am I going to be laid off\nAnd not going to get fired I wasn't really working for family anymore you know I was just one of many

about their family history and in childhood and it's really interesting because you guys came from really entrepreneurial backgrounds and\nLeo you had you know commercial real estate background and then you began to Journey Out and do all sorts of different things from there\nAnd ... you know we really look at some of the things that we we learned in childhood and and how it directs our lives how it it\nForms are thinking about things and Peggy you talked about um you know your family and just that strong entrepreneurial spirit and how you were heartbroken when they sold the business and you moved into corporate America which must have been an incredible shock\nAnd awe your ... you know working and and dealing with the corporate structure that you never dealt with before\nAnd can you talk a little bit about about that you know you you touched on the pressure you touched on I'm having a ... you know to find that that next deal when you were in sales and then what what happened as you moved out of sales\nWell what I did I I was really in a quandary trying to figure out what I wanted to do I just wasn't sure you know where I fit in with my my God given gift and so what\nI did I I did several jobs on contract where I was able to go out to get for corporations\nAnd I'm In one day I just thought she now on doing this I'm not getting any benefit on working\nWell in those days I was just working forty hours but it was more as time went on but I thought you know if I'm going to be putting in forty hours a week then I probably need to to land something and so I was at a bank and they offered me a job and I ended up staying there for Seventeen years\nAnd what was happening to me like I Would maybe go in at eight o'clock in the morning and\nUm I Would leave for about nine o'clock at night you know banks were really doing a lot of lay offs and you know if the other people's jobs Scott cat then you know\nOf layoffs and you know if that other people's Josh Scott cat then you know they needed the people that were still there to handle the workload\nAnd I was fortunate to live at the ladder because if a person that I was reporting too and um and so I ended up I was like working for a bank president and so we had our regular line of business you know the\nBusiness that we were in we were in corporate banking that paid our salaries and then we had\nThe presidential duties and that was fine but it was a lot of our ... my boss laughter bank which was stressful and I wanted to hang on because I wanted to stay there long enough to have health insurance right so I scramble called all these departments around the bank that people that I've known\nThat I got you know from being there for so long\nAnd then I landed a job and treasury where corporations would call in with issues and I was in\nCorporate customer service than we would help and you know solve their their issues in their problems and actually when I got there and they told me that my salary was going to be kept because I made more my prior job\nAnd and again that was long hours I was staying after to keep that and um you know I liked it I Love the clients that on one state passed a like rule of sixty age plus number of years of being there you could early retire and so I asked to do that at that point\nNow yeah and that's you you get to that point where it's OK here I Am I I've worked all my life for this and now I'm they're telling me that's it I can make any more money and um and no no way really within their structure to earn it\nAnd Leo ... you and in sales and you've got a variety of different things that you were doing and how did how did you experience that with your career\nAnd [noise] well I tell you all and I'm\nStarting out of the commercial real estate brokers ... my ... our our ... or a tech and show about the YMCA that I ended up you know I just got for us better at all like I've been on a date and all like three years and that's how I got to order the\nTo the wine industry and doing that I Would always do it all happened as you'd end up they give you a territory and you build up your wine cells um and and and\nAs time went on you would end up getting it tore you'd be lacking pretty good money and then I cut your territory but you just go and they call you and and that's the you know instead of getting two and three quarters\nOr satellite yourself you're going to end up getting you know we're going to give you tune in at a quarter and it's just you couldn't say I'd say you know like that wants to marry and built this up I've met all my all this and you're going to do this to me and I just say that's the way it's going to be in because\nThat's the word came down from ... headquarters and I'll just I'll tell you what my blood pressure or just go right through the roof\nUm and it was time run on the other part of it we got older older a lot of times you have going on at two o'clock in the morning go do grocery store reset um on wines and um you're doing it for a lot of other people in the next thing you know that is doing a mentor is on once a month and the warehouse and\nThey just kept that and the net and things to it and I'm Sorry I just ... when\nThe uh add printing business and picked up and I found some pretty lucrative jobs I did that for a long time and that was that was good odds and when I got out I like I had mentioned in the past I never really enjoyed\nManaging people can sometimes you know it was just a manual job on the other end of the ads running machine but it was just also door that maybe they wouldn't show up or they wouldn't and they'd be compliant and or they want more money while you're in and it's just\nThat was a first right in and of of that business along with going on and um I had a tour\nThere's many in by members of my family die of cancer\nAs time went on I kept coming back home or tell patients that you know what my ears are ringing well and the pad printing business using as a um oil based inks were pickup damaging to drop it off on the on the item that you're praying\nAnd Peggy said you know what there's there's it's kind of a family business and um\nMaybe this isn't a wise thing to do\nAnd so I'm with my family being and having some cancer\nAnd everything I thought you know what I've run across inscribed charge that wanted to end up he kept bothering me you're going to bomb a business and I kept telling them you know or he wanted me to teach them how to pay for ... I had to learn on my own and it was really it is it's caught it from technicalities to it\nAnd so um I thought you know one of the fellas go after this God or get out of this thing and um you know just met mom on top of the world right now I'm off work it out at the top and so that's\nWhat I ended up doing and I'm and I'm Glad I did it because I'm Still alive today and Myers aren't rain and I'm saying was I Know that that was a a by didn't have problems that's one thing about being a ... but it was such a a neat and business and there were so much in demand for it\nAnd I'm a because a lot of people never heard of it and um I mean I could pick up customers and it just got better and better but you know if you aren't going to be alive what the heck\nYeah what what does it really adamant in those those right instead of you and ... you know this trans transformational story of you know working through the traditional model coming from entrepreneurial homes than getting thrown into more of the traditional model that most of us experience with work\nAnd then realizing the need for change and this is Len Morrow with Peggy and Leo on the Dell wants the radio show in in a moment we'll be back with more of this story as we talk about change and discovering where we really fit in life if you have a question for Peggy or Leo age\nSeven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven we'll be right back\nUm because what\nHappened is that all came back to me with the knowledge from the family from law from um\nUh just you know going to school and learning about real estate but I had you know uh but there are certain things about the oil they all family you know with ... and all and cousins\nAll this kind of disenchanted because of after the past you know my parents and the market at all you know people there wasn't there needed to be a plan and great to be control on things and\nTo all kinds of disenchanted with that it ended with a real estate um aspect and so until I came across lifestyles and they saw road solve those problems one other thing that kind of got my attention is\nI just remember my father and uncle born under a deal down in Houston and it was a deal worth it was an apartment complex and I just got out of college and\nUh I like I said you know what why don't you go to the closing down in Houston and so that gave me the closing statement unless they want you to when you get this call the account and and I want you want you to tell them the numbers and everything it's like any of this closing statement ... she was\nI said I didn't tell me about this deal and stuff and I said how long have you on this and I said five years and I said I got through it analyze it and I thought I saw an ally of the hundred and twenty five percent for five years in less than that I said forget that they are such a\nA male is is this is unbelievable and there were just limit the partners in that situation it was last are gone and they'd gotten on a\nLimited partnership and I'm I'm Down in ...\nAnd that always stuck with me and I thought man this is all of a ...\nAnd so on that kind of let me go to the point where you know real estate was still on mom on and I'm Glad I had done what I'd done in the past and um it was painful going through the argument for family members after our aunts or uncles and parents and a passing cars or you know the ...\nThere needed to be a plan and that there was one and so that was a shame\nBut um I've seen everything from trade and ... and um you know just all the benefits that go with real estate so that that kind of bought me up to that point\nSee we're ready to jump in you know you you'd you'd seen that real estate work and it's really interesting I'm I'm a second generation real estate investor too and and it's really interesting how our parents don't actually teaches the nitty gritty of the business right into somehow it's something you do homicide while you pursue that\nTraditional route but Peggy I think you are a lot more skeptical about this weren't you\n\nOh I definitely was Lynn I you know I thought about the money that we spent to be trained on a stock

he will go\nBack to do on the radio show with me here today is um Mr Scott bad Oscar he is the latest news the most current multifamily mentor other Houston market area scot doing with the lifestyles for a long time on stubborn apartment complexes going after a few more right now and has been helping people diligently even before he was\nOn the mentor a team so Scott\nI'm going to ask you the probably the hardest question to ask any mentor\nAnd I don't know sixty days enough for you to come up with a robot answer but maybe just you're eight years of helping people's friends throughout lifestyle may give you a good sense of where I'm going with this and that is what every new mentors I said you know how do you grade yourself as a mentor\nAnd it's really difficult because you know he said well I Would agree to myself that no one ever has failed deal and you can err on that side by saying OK I'm just going to say no to everything the easiest thing for a mentor to do is to say no to everything or you'll never be wrong\nNo one will ever come back at you and say you were you man you were wrong and that's what I Love that but\nUh the other side we have the other kind of mentor Scott a we have a few of these guys that are just um I don't come the right word for it so it's not insulting a there they really really really really really want to help you get what you want\nTo the point where maybe they're not\nUsing enough of their own personal um ...\nConservative ... to ... them from making yeah restraint and and being able to if you look I Know you really want those I notice when really you know you really like this but there's quite a few things\nThat you know the red flags go up the hearing the back of my next going up this just doesn't seem like the right deal for you [noise] um [noise] you know there's that balance in the middle where Ninety nine percent of the ... people put through deals end up doing good ones the other one percent of people that don't listen to how to do what you don't want to do it uh that's the perfect\nAnd then the final indicator is okay how many people by retired and make millionaires out of that's good that's a good score card and how many people that I've consulted have become national park association winters so\nAnd how many people that I've consulted it become national park association winters so I haven't had this conversation with you yeah because you've been so busy since you got here and I've been so busy last couple of weeks also have you thought about any of those parameters constraints as to how you would grade yourself personally as a consultant\nWow I really haven't thought of that you know you hit on a lot of things there that I have seen it sixty days and I thought about sixty days but I hadn't thought about the overall kinda what do you want your legacy to be a deal and and this and what I'm doing now um I can tell you that\nWhen I Am working with people and I've done this and this is part of the lifestyles culture that we try to kind of pushed through and when and\nIf if you talk about people who are doing exactly what we're doing syndicating deals by deals whatever outside of lifestyles so many times I was in this conversation yesterday\nThose guys make all their money up front on fees and things for putting that deal together and they really don't have a vested interest in what the long term success as a any particular deal\nBecause we invest in every deal that we do in addition to taking other people's money [laughter] I really look at this and Curtis does a great job in a multi family orientation session of talking about the family office and that's kind of a new thought that he put in my head\nAnd really figuring out how to maximize my net worth and in effect grow it and so I look at every deal that way whether\nOr not and that now that I'm a mentor and so the two smaller deals that I've mentor people on there were no brainer sin and when I mentioned before sometimes you gotta give 'em a little shut off the cliff\nThat's what these war they were first deals for these folks but when I looked at him it was like as if you don't make a decision to do this I got twenty other people that I Know we'll do this today\nAnd uh and then they could potentially jobs and they're going to be great [laughter]\nUm the hundred and sixty four ...\nScott Scott ... you're just so you have the ... that are using the today I called the cattle prod mood you know what do you do with someone who won't take actually hit him with the cattle ... what does that and I used to say it'll tell us if you don't do this I'm going to do it or I'm going to give it to somebody else but we're not going to let those when get away so I've always called the cattle ... move\nOkay started a hundred or a hundred and sixty four year deal was one that we had to finance a little bit we had to do a little deeper analysis it wasn't so obvious a good deal\nAnd we we had to work at a little bit before we came to grips unfortunately Roger having run his own business and being in six am ideals are so far he's very smart very good at at analyzing the numbers\nAnd a way and we got through that but it took a little bit of work then that brings us to the the one that I'm working on this afternoon which is the out of town deal\nUm this one doesn't help that it's not in the Houston market were up an act or\nYou know ... for ten years now and I pretty well known sub markets and things like that that's what I had to do a little homework on\nAnd when he first brought back as an initial analysis I found some things that I thought he was trying to favor the deal a little too much and I did have to pull them back and say you know my job is to keep you out of a bad deal and here are the concerns that I have he's gone back and massage some of that we've gotten a more farm alone quote which can substantially affect the deal\nAnd so we're going to take another run at it this afternoon and so I have seen a little bit of the spectrum I guess how deals develop I haven't had a deal yet\nUh we had one on a a acquisition road trip that a few people were pretty heavy on and I did we didn't get very deep into it but I\nCame out on the road trip and I said the steel too rich there's not enough\nUpside to this deal to make it worth their while [noise] and uh we would call a couple of people off of that deal um but fortunately we didn't get all the way down to do diligence and get everybody's hopes up to invested in the deal but that's that's the biggest problem sometimes you get people that are doing first deals and they're emotionally\nInvested in them and it's hard for them to let go and and that's where I Do see my kind of position here is to make sure that people do get a little too anxious or lose some patience and make sure the good deal comes along because it took me\nNine months before I got my first deal under contract and I was completely blocking the gray line between unemployed and self employed for those nine months so uh I was definitely anxious and Emory a Jacob had to hold me back from doing a bad deal at that time so I've never forgotten that\nYou know I remember during your rise and so forth you were you an interesting personality your personality fears and nothing\nBut yet you're very analytical and I've had conversations with you in you know after our conversations where it's been like man the worlds coming to an end in which better be careful that hurt other conversation with you you know what I'm going to go do something way out here over left field but we've never done before because I just think it's interesting that my my really pay off\nSo you you got a lot of ah versatility in your personality for being able to consult people\nI Want to ask you next question though and that is this um about a year ago maybe six months I Can't remember time flies you know the last\nCouple of months ago on very quickly but we were sitting over gee Alexander's one day and you were kind of like you're kind of pulling back saying you know I don't know I'm really kinda the point where I might not do any more deals and uh I might just start buying Partridge out and then you know changing my position more like yours do ... more of it\nAnd then I'm looking at your your your work for the day and then you got like one new deal you just close into more deals you going after\nWhat did you do do do you do consulting changing but we had to go to a break so I don't know what you're talking to break but I'm just wondering did you take some new go Jews are taking our new vitamins or was helping other people got you back out there going\nMan the market really is good right now let's get going so what's the hold out one back if you guys want to ask got specific question our number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven\nI Will leave the phone lines open during the break and\nWhen you get in well for you to write up when we can go next segment we write back was got Ben Austin is a ... radio show\n[laughter] [laughter]\nAnd then the concept came to us for the first time ever to you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas I don't know what percentage I'm not good even guess what percentage I don't know how many units are not going to guess buddy it's a lot of properties a lot of units\nAnd we thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in all the taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would be like to take the money\nAnd the sophistication and the experience that we're the cumulative in this group and take some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or without being insulted elites they have less experience than we do\nAnd be able to throw that these properties in the markets outside of the Texas market area and ah you nailed one\nWe've had four or five others have gotten nailed them last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people coming to road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston\nAnd Dallas and San Antonio in going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to Phoenix and going to uh you know all these different places we had these deals\nAnd they're now saying we opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I you know you see that I think you're feeling that and I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated again\nIt absolutely so ah and you're absolutely right my wife and I are first two and a half years that we were married we lived in Cincinnati, Ohio when she got out of grad school that was where best opportunity was so we moved there for a little while before we moved back to Houston and\nBeginning of last year I had went on a big junk mail a\nCampaign and so I started an subscribing to all these things that creep into your mailbox overtime for signing up for various things and I sit on the couch with a a a football game or something on she was on the other end of the couch down whatever she was doing on her laptop\nAnd I was an subscribing and deleting all this junk mail and one of the things that happened a A R a which is one of the big brokers here in town and they are national\nOr had gotten bought by Cantor Fitzgerald and when that happened I had been on their website and I had set preferences so I only got deals and the Houston metropolitan area at the time that I started doing this I said why would anybody have to leave a city like Houston there's so much opportunity here to do any of this\nAnd I had I stated rule that if I couldn't drive to it and be home\nBy the end of the day I didn't need to do and so ah anyway as I Am sorting and and I didn't batch delete I was just hit and delete delete delete scrolling through the subject line the Cincinnati deal pops up and I went home and I clicked on it\nAnd I very quickly from looking at so many deal sized up that if this was in Houston, Texas it was a no brainer and they would sell for a lot more than the price was upon us a posting that I saw\nAnd so yeah I asked my wife what do you think about buying this deal out of town and we've got a business excuse to go fly up there a couple of times a year and see all those friends that we left behind Twenty years ago when we came back to Houston\nAnd she said whatever you want to do if you want to manage outside but it means that I've never had to do this but I'm probably gonna be gone at least one night a month going up there just to make sure everything's still running right and she said that's fine you know our our two girls were out of the house by this time and we just have one kid left there\nSo things are manageable if you'd like to try and do it so we ended up doing it um I went to my three\nUh kinda largest investors that have long term vision and I said guys a little bit of a flyer but boy you back you know the steel and they were all in\nAnd we did the deal's been phenomenal the ah we bonded since August of last year we're on pace to return Nineteen percent cash on cash and our first year of ownership Brennan interest only period so things are\nObviously cash along really well but it's a fifty five and over high yield play a property not not a a value play that we're having to fix up\nAnd we kept saying management group in fact it was a it was run and we're really well so I saw no reason to shake things up there we put it a little bit of cap it acts and we're making it even more efficient so that when the principal kicks and our cash on cash probably won't have to tip\nWill just a cover it with our increased threats that we are getting out of this place\nSo that's a great place I was actually up there about three weeks ago I guess and they really wanted one of my masters who was from Battle Creek Michigan founded the lifestyles on the radio show and came down here to invest they wanted him\nAt the Detroit road show that you guys had about three weeks ago and it couldn't be there so I got to go up and be surrogate and help out and really kind of tell his story and how we met down here and now we're investing in other markets up there and\nI got to tell you a J. B. data Durham\nHad a phenomenal presentation and not only walking around Detroit we were staying downtown walking the streets at ten thirty at night from a restaurant that we went out to the night before the event and\nI went into Detroit with a bad attitude and walked away completely changed have got a lot of metrics that look really good up there\nAnd I think they are probably a pretty well poised to to have some great things going on and we have members as as you said that found that show uh most of them came down to Dallas and so it was the closest place to fly into her drive to and I did their their studies they invested in some deals there and now they're doing deals in and around Detroit Michigan\nUh well what do you think that a place to take a break right there's got to come back we'll finish up on Detroit and the other national stuff you've been working on right back with Scott and often the Dell wants to review\nOf [laughter] [noise] [laughter] [laughter]\nYou're listening to the radio show will be back with more people are supposed to just\nYou know that every dollar you invest in real estate makes you money five wave cash flow of money in your pocket each month equity captures the thousands of dollars you when you have a right he meant by a white property using them right map appreciation we it was the increase in value overtime\nAll right property using the right man appreciation real estate can increase in value overtime\nEquity fail to pay down your mortgage each month\nAnd finally the tax advantage when done correctly real estate investors pay\nNo taxes on our cash flow and capital gains lifestyles unlimited these are the five ways we make money in real estate which is why real estate accounts were more millionaires in the world today than any other investment vehicle you should have some real estate in your portfolio to learn how to attend to lifestyles unlimited free workshop\nCalled eight six six Ninety seven one eighty nine Seventy or go to lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com\nAnd register for the next available more jobs\nThat eight six six Ninety seven one eighty nine Seventy or go to lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com\n\nYou have to decide I Will get it right now is the world over the world was going to crack\nDown on the question here you see how you can connect with down off the air on your radio dot com click on Twitter\nDown\nI Believe the good teachers as you said to be able to breathe through multiple levels of words that are completely different from one to nominate down that\nWe know you're out there\nHiding in plain sight living a life of quiet desperation wondering if you're going to beat your money to the grave\nThere's a better way a better life at lifestyles unlimited it's time to live the life you deserve you can only do that by creating passive income lettuce show you how it's just two hours it can't be worse than another meeting about meetings or another mine last night in front of the TV\nGotta lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com that's lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com\nOr tension all man here by a grand for your lead you down but your best days are behind you think again if you suffer from any type of the the regardless of the reader medical history but doctors\nOf the alpha medical group can help you in now\nThere is no needles no surgery no medication just knew it was debatable proven treatment from Europe using a boost the energy wave power after the ... medical device regenerate its blood vessels in a red tiled tissue was short being office sessions\nAnd it's all done with virtually no needles no surgery no medication told now from falling from Asian call and I know for seven six three fourteen hundred nine or forty seven\nSix three fourteen hundred one hundred percent\nNatural none of these are worried about six or a tile is function go nine or forty seven six three fourteen hundred today in your\nLife back when the alpha medical groups called and I know for his seven six three fourteen hundred for a visit our website in alphabetical group dot com\nIt's time to start planning your two thousand and Eighteen Christmas Party and the Salem center is the perfect location we have an auditorium back can be decorated beautifully and we can post your get together for a U.S twenty people or as many as four hundred\nPlus the Salem center has that wow factor you will want for your holiday party may sit down lunch or dinner yes we can do that a mix and mingle of and we can do that to an auditorium style Christmas program of course you can do what\nIt also with a memorable style at a price point that it's very reasonable to give us a call now we have space available but we are filling up very quickly the number eight six one zero zero eight six one zero zero\n[noise]\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one ...
