Congress edition and the blockade and the position that the administration has taken on that will there be any change in that will they looked at it differently being that the biggest military base that we have is their right but I Do huh how that might change if\nI don't think it'll have much of a change it'll make discoveries a little bit more welcome here in Washington but by and large ah we're all that we've now got to the point where the countries are comfortable with the relationship with us or they're having a by annual\nA strategic dialogue with us or they continue to buy large quantities of military equipment the basic functions very well if anything that base has become more important right\nOr so from the point of view I think this is a a fear I'd say it's not for us but they're already in a in a good place\nThe country that I think is going to be most affected by this and one of the other Gulf states will be the you ate a because my ... been sort of mine is seen as the protege\nOf the crown prince of the UAE he Mohammed ... who's a who's older and smarter\nAnd for or came over and it was meant able to use Mohammed been so much to carry much of the ... agenda I mean for example and it's pretty clear to everybody in the region or the campaign against cutter was dreamed up by the U.S have the ... of the reasons\nAnd uh [noise] my ... was persuaded to go along a\n... and also the you a he has a very much taken the lead Healy is pursuing a separate policy from Saudi Arabia and Yemen are you a seems to be trying to live off the southern part of Yemen make an independent country dependent on the UAE eat\nRight and the Iraqi has been using shouting power to pressure the money's falling in line with him so far successfully but they needed the Saudis to be able to do that\nWell\nAll of a sudden a Saudi Arabia is got to be rather toxic war or the ... as well so a large part of what they have been doing their own policies in the region\nHave been based upon the fact of fame and able uh because of the personal relationship between the two crown princes are they able to get the Saudis to back them under actually everything and that now becomes a much more difficult stories of south or in the region\nMissouri back to what you're saying\nSo I\nMiss her back to what you're saying is the Iranians might want to distance themselves from mom and dad and some a little bit and still has\nA I think at least in the public perception of it really going to have to do that\nRight [noise] and I'm only got a couple more minutes as your bathroom ... I Want to get your take on Nikki Haley's resignation I Know the president says he's interviewing five people you were in that world your former ambassador to the state of cutter now president of the U.S governor business\nCouncil what did you think of the timing of ambassador Haley's resignation and he sees a viable replace\n\nA the timing I think has two parts to it\nShe didn't want to do I make it look like shoes voting at the end of the first half of the term uh she needed to give the president enough time she's going to stay on the job till the end of the year ... which gives the president last time so I think she was I think she's got personal reasons for leaving\nA\nShe has been in politics for so long or they're in the newspaper stories that her personal family finances are or not and really great shame and I'll tell you or we don't pay and our ... very well I mean this\nIs a prejudice I used to be one myself\nBut we really don't pay or ambassador is very well\nAnd uh\nLiving in New York I don't ... even though there's extra as it doesn't come anywhere near covering the cost of living are living in being the ambassador of New York and all the things you have to do\nA ... it's a it's a huge burden we've got this problem in a number of other major countries around the world like blood and so forth so\nIf you ask me I think it was simply a she didn't realize being governor of state is one thing you know she's a she's a good person she's an honest person\nSo I don't think she was taking advantage of her official position but if you're in New York on a on the salaries of the state department pays the math or even the fact that you're tossing in the house so if they really\nDoesn't cover it so I think\nThey may have been a personal economic necessity to step aside for a little bit much should also be a great asset for the Republican Party in a couple of years' time she is she's smart or she can take middle positions\nUh she uh\nShe's very articulate she looks sassy a little bit sassy and breath but that's OK that works in today's politics\nAs well and of course she's now we'll learn a minority which is something that the Republican Party really desperately need [noise]\nFor its future I think she has a long term future she's young not so sure that when you're twenty twenty four maybe\nShe somebody Iran I don't know if she wants to run for president but she is going to be a a person who can get a who can really get a lot of people who today wouldn't vote Republican\nReplacement\nWho will be here replaced\nA replacement I have no idea uh I've I've been looking at a little bit at the names I it really boils down to whether or not a John Bolton has a\nBig voice right in this election or John boulders or for whatever it is good qualities are is very much a fire bomb thrower and he's going to be\nTrying to persuade the president to come up with someone like that which I think was a mistake when he was\nA part in the United nations or he basically lost his ability to control a to control that party because a lot of the way you the the us functions that a lot of the stuff that we get that we actually get a lot more done\nThen you would think from the newspaper accounts but most of that Congress because if you got a smart ambassador who reaches out to people makes a lot of friends\nOr the UN is a place for a guy who knows how to make out of ... grant small a lot of small favors add a lot of the small countries who voted the un really need those small favorite city of the U.S ambassador to the United nations\nUh\nKnows how to play these people well it fits a transactional game but you know I made sure of the city of New York doesn't really enforce all the parking tickets you guys got I get your vote the couple of things and this is the way the\nUn operates under the uh\nI did all the fancy stuff at the top are under the big news so what we need is some is issues or or this is a perfect place if there's any southern politicians there this is the perfect place for southern\nDish uh\nThese guys are real experts such closing so that's where I Would uh put my cars but whether or not they are so I can tell because I I it depends on who's who's got the president's here I'm just what I mean this is the most important ... oil position or\nThe bachelor or the United nations is the only American ambassador who sits regularly a cabinet meetings\nAnd has instant access to the president\nSo uh it's a very very important position\nOr you need you need to balance is so carefully as to who you're put in that position I mean that's the qualifications I don't know what the inner workings are right now inside the White House to decide who is going to be the the job or not\nWell we heard record now from Germany has a interview but we've also heard that the president is I'm a woman\nTo take the place to Nikki Haley so are those are in conflict so no no one knows we do know that he's interviewed by people but sounds like he's going to make it very deliberate decision\nBut it's very interesting what you're saying and certainly the profile that you outlined doesn't exactly say national Judy director John Bolton who doesn't exactly he's not ... ... ... type like can I say is humming animal\nWhat it looked at the first and most important job of any president United States it's productive citizens from all enemies both foreign and domestic and he swears for the constitution that he's going to do that and other than that commitment\nIs making sure that us citizens are protected\nAnd allowing seven thousand individuals who are undocumented come into the country is not a protection\nWe're the most welcoming country that will take a million immigrants a year into the country more than any other country in the world we are a nation of immigrants but there is a proper like you do this and so I think the president's going to work with Mexico to try and get their leaders to stop at at least slow this care of and that but also mentally\nWhat we need is a woman in the southern border and without the wall we will have a human wall of military people school ensure that people were\nCountry illegally are not allowed to do that and I know it sounds harsh and I'm not advocating for violence what I'm advocating for is the right way of doing things and if that means those people who are coming here I Believe many of them are using children\nAnd they're using you know look John think about it you're going to take a woman and her child and have her walk two thousand miles which is the distance we're talking about two thousand miles with nothing but the clothes on her back issues in her feet you know for child\nWalking through Central America and I'll up through Mexico and that's a good idea to hopefully get to the United states only to be turned around it doesn't make any sense I Believe part of this has been organized by people in the mid term elections or two weeks away and want to make this a political issue and I don't know who's\nFunding it but I Am gravely concerned about part of some of the people who may be in that caravan who aren't here for political asylum and are only here to try and hurt in the United states\nSo Cory is this going to backfire I mean if indeed it was set for or was inspired for political reasons right so that we can get back to the narrative of kids in cages in a zero tolerance and that a fiasco\nThat went down on that policy is this something that could actually backfire now when the Democrats\nWell I think it does backfire because if you remember John you look when Hillary Clinton was a U.S senator she voted for a border wall I Am going to war but the fence okay that was\nThere was money that was supposed to be allocated for that are complaining about this president has asked for by both Republicans and Democrats was give me the financial resources available on the southern border\nAnd what the president offered which I thought was very aggressive was a pathway to citizenship for those individuals\nOr in the country through what they call no fault of their own coming to refer to his dreamers the president offered that in ... in in relation to give me the for the wall you give me the money will put a path forward and the Democrats\nDidn't get that done they didn't want that done because they want to politicize this and now that we're two weeks to the day from the mid term elections the issue of immigration is that the forefront again\nAnd from in crummy issues perspective I don't think it helps for Democrats because they had been soft on immigration and soft on open borders and that's not where the American people are by and large\nAs we go into the midterms now Cory there's a new poll out by the Washington Post just today and it's basically looked at not just the generic ballot which has people running for Congress in Los Angeles and and a New York city ... center with wide leads\nThat influenced the generic ballot but it looked at the fifty most closest races all toss ups that are going to basically decide who can trolls the house of representatives\nAnd in this poll the post had to admit that all of the races that the Democrats are leading had tightened\nAnd now Republicans read the tighter ahead and the tide in the district that matter\nWas turning in the direction of the president\nAnd his party and the wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the president's approval rating is up to get this forty seven percent right that's up dramatically from where I was just not that far back how do you read this\nWell John it's clearly a good sign for the Republicans they had some wind up their backs if you look at historical\nPerspective this president is now more popular at his first term than many others going into their mid terms including Brock Obama but the media doesn't want to say that they don't want to talk about that narrative it almost always gets glossed over but your earliest point on this topic is the most important in the places where the Democrats are supposed to win in a walk\nIn seats where they knew that they had good candidate and they were going to walk up those elections and pull away early\nThey haven't been able to do that and then the competitive Republican district I just think Virginia whether it's a David Braddock Scott Taylor or Barbara Comstock in the races where the republic tend to eat we see\nThem not only holding on but expanding some legion in places with two weeks ago\nBy and large not on every case basis Republicans are in a better position today than they were just last week and what that means is\nVoters are coming home they're seen the more money in their paychecks they're seen more money in their bank account they're single or job opportunities and they know what's at stake in the November elections which is returning a majority\nTo give us less regulation more tax cuts\nReturning a majority to give us less regulation more tax cuts and an opportunity to grow our businesses or going back to the way it used to be which is putting a majority in place which wants to overburden you with government rules and regulations\nAnd believe that the government is the solutions to problems so I think people are realizing it squarely focus now part of the reason that they're squarely focus is the Trump Pence team\nHas been on the road campaigning all over the country in key congressional district key Senate races to make sure voters know exactly what's at stake in two weeks\nYou're with the John ... radio network you're Godzilla the truth in America we're with Corey Lewandowski\nHe is the author he's known authors kind of amazing you you went from campaign manager to Trump for president\nToo and author he's written a best selling book to let Trump be Trump a must read on the campaign you could buy that'd be Dalton you can buy that Amazon your favorite books written by wherever you want so uh it's really neat and he's also coming out with a brand new book on November twentieth\nTrump's enemies from within and he'll be naming names about some of the shenanigans that goes on in the White House every day and he's also with a vice president Mike Pence political action committee which is a hard it's hard money\nPack and so he's traveling with the VP around the United states trying to win as many key congressional and Senate races as they can Corey there was an article yesterday published in the New York times about an altercation\nBetween yourself and uh John Kelly chief of staff back in February where the alleged that he grabs your neck tie which seems kinda odd to me it doesn't seem like the kind of guy that would do that is that fake news or that real\nYou know John ... it's amazing they talk about something that may have transpired from uh eight or nine months ago right like I've got a very good relationship with John John Kelly on behalf of the president to make sure that the president's agenda implemented I Do it from the outside John does it from the inside\nAnd and we've agreed to work together very closely to make sure that the Trump Pence agenda continues to get implemented so you know the stories\nOf chaos in the White House are clearly over on the stories of mayhem a trail and this is on those narratives that the media wants to talk about because it suits their agenda as opposed to what's really going on which is more Americans back to work\nMore people working now than ever before in our history more of the lowest unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanics in recorded history the world's unemployment rate for women and sixty five years that for the American people care about and everything else is just salacious you know real rumors innuendo\nLet's get to the to show you fair President Trump yesterday Corey saying that he was not particularly convinced about the Saudi narrative what happens now\nLook at I I don't think there's any questions at the Saudi has a responsibility to place to show 'em but we should also understand that this should not be surprising to many people are this is something\nThat it you know I well I don't travel to Saudi Arabia or other parts of the world unfortunately happens all too often but there has to be accountability what that accountability I don't know what we need to get all the facts um but as you know the latest part of this story is that uh they had a body double wearing his show gets close walking around to\nMake it look like the guy was still alive they've now admitted he's dead\nThey said it was a result of a fist fight I called I didn't get a question about a national security expert and ... and that the American people don't have\nAre just entering a very basic perspective it seems very difficult to imagine a man of issue in age getting into a fist fight with Fifteen other professionals and I'm thinking that that's going to result in the outcome\nAnd and it clearly didn't put we need to make sure we know what an appropriate response is we have to get all the facts and it's something that I\nHappened very quickly because there shouldn't be accountability is what we believe transpired would transpire\n[noise] well I think the president is going to act he said he was going to get with Congress and find a bi partisan way to respond to this but we're

N. and find\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment second member to Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have\nTo figure out a way to monitor this so they can see what sort of this kind of hate pops up and then be able to take action before the clock ticks place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I think it's important for your authorities to see what they can do to\nPrevent the next attack and you and says armed guards at many of your scenario\nYeah that's that's a reality that unfortunately Jews face around the world if you go to London and offend a God you are more likely than not to see actually a policeman\nOr a police car outside same thing in Paris same thing in Brussels and other places around the world that you don't want to see that happen in America I Do think that on high holidays well Shawn and you'll keep poured many synagogues you do have\nA local law enforcement authorities at least since nine eleven\nBut this is just choose going about their business praying\nAnd in a synagogue on a on a Saturday morning and to think that every single synagogue in America needs that type of protection protection is it's sad but unfortunately at least for the foreseeable future it might it might be necessary not only to protect the population\nBut to give them a sense of security one thing that's important is for political leaders to speak out for very strongly against that I was very pleased to hear\nFrom President Trump I thought he had you know what the strongest combinations frankly I've ever heard I've never heard a non Israeli non Jewish leader say\nThose who try to destroy the Jews we will destroy them I've never heard that mark from any leader\nAnd not only was it that ... that I did was I heartened to hear the president of United States say that but I was heartened to hear the applause he got from the people who were at that rally in Illinois when he fit that\nUh and it's important for people on the right to spit out the extremists among them to David Dukes it's important for people on the left to spit out the extremist like Louis Farrakhan and others and to say that there's no place for this type of hatred in the United states\nYou know mainstream conservatives have never consider themselves for writer and brace David do we repudiate people like that but we do have a growing bbs movement in this country it's growing in our college campuses quite frankly it's growing in the left and there's haters everywhere every breed of every stripe and so forth and so on\nBut in some ways it's getting more and more mainstream the the UN is rabidly anti Semitic the bbs movement which has been mainstream did many with many corporations and many organizations and political organizations in Europe and even somewhat in the United states\nThis again this is this is intended as an anti Semitic anti ... anti Israel movement do you see this growing to\nNo question about it I mean for many years to the un has been ground zero France Semitism and holding Israel up to standard holds no other nation on earth when you have you know two thirds of the ... general assembly U.N General assembly resolutions against Israel\nThat's got to tell you something when you have more resolutions passed against Israel and the un human rights council that all the countries of the world combined\nUm that's got to tell you something and this is a deep problem people thought it was a thing of the past if not a it's a very serious and it's growing and that's why it's so important you know there there's a an old saying that you know it starts with the Jews but it never ends with the ... we have always been seen as can area of the ... in the coal mine\nIn of civilization so when you have those noxious fumes that are directed at the news\nUm it's not going to end there it's going to spread and that's why it's very important for people to frankly mark put all the politics aside\nAnd stand together whether you're on the right a conservative or liberal whether you're a Republican or Democrat and and they noticed kind of hate and and the lead by showing that this type of bigotry this type of hatred will have no sanctions and the United states of America\nYou know I agree completely with putting politics aside but I've been watching as I'm sure you have in the United states tier media and its politics first second and third it's politics morning noon and night it's politics trumped responsible for this is Trump this Trump this is Trump is\nAnd this killer this mass murder this this Jew hater he hated Trump he didn't like Trump he's headed to many Jews around now you have in President Donald Trump made my view the the greatest supporter of Israel but any American president\nHe's knowledge that Jerusalem is the capital the president did that before he's moved our embassy to Jerusalem they all promised they never did it before he took this Iran deal which was passed by Congress\nAnd the prior administration which gave tens of billions of dollars to the terrorists regime which has the United states in Israel and its sights he said no more to that\nI mean from my perspective as an American is a conservative who's who's been watching this stuff for a long long time this president has been the best friend of the Jewish state certainly during my lifetime\nYeah I mean I I said this before or we've never had a stronger supportive of Israel with President Trump\nA and frankly it hasn't even been close in terms of what he's done I mean you look at some of those things that he's gone you have a Nikki Haley ambassador Haley at the un pushing back against all this anti Israel sentiment obviously the signature on some [noise]\nAnd the case to be ... the most anti Semitic regime and the planet they call for the annihilation of one and only two state and you have Hezbollah uh ... Iran did actually one of his bowl as leaders that a few years ago that he hoped all the Jews will come to Israel so we can wipe them out there\nFor the president of the United states stood up to the entire world and withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran has storage sank tens and against Iran and in doing so he is starved is anti Semitic terrorists regime of hundreds of billions of dollars that would be used to pick your dreams\nAnd promote a Israelis are and and also to putting all of our Arab neighbors and everything else one good thing that came out of that that nuclear deal it's bought Israel or in the Arab world closer together but we we appreciate very much in a very grateful for that support and like I said I'm very grateful\nThat the president so forcefully\nA condemned or the anti Semitic attack I think it it is a very very important I think if people think that all of these things happened uh because of\nPresident Trump's election ... they're just getting themselves they don't understand the history of anti Semitism it's not only the world's longest hatred older sacred it's the most malleable hatred I mean Jews or or\nHad been attacked and killed you know for being a capital for being a communist for being a the biggest dollars for being the biggest hawks for being called for being called you know ethnic separatists\nHaters can always find a reason to hate us and it's been going on for a long time and I hope one positive thing that can come out of this horrific acts\nAnd I hope one positive thing that can come out of this horrific acts keep than together again at the ... is President Trump is not the reason why you have like Jeremy Corbyn\nAnd you know uh the head of the Labour Party and anti Semite it's not that we're in a while you have all these attacks and for many years and you're up against fortunately this thing is\nComing here to the United states and ... and is now eleven uh worshipers and hail a Pittsburgh but if anything can come out of it hopefully people can stand together and put politics aside understand that there are people who were anti Semite thoughts\nAnd people should stand together against this and out the anti Semite on the side of the political wild that's\nNot just calling it when it's on the other side but calling it on your own head whether it's David Duke whether it was there ever comes when it's not a college campus with people trying to think about Israel and fame and demonizing Israel and make all these charges that Israel's apartheid state races state a perpetrator of canon dot\nWhich I think a lot of people put a level of hatred towards Israel but you don't see of any other country this demonization ever is people have to stand up to it and I think in protecting the schools I think they're going

trying to turn the story and the Trump um that's perfectly fine things say whatever they want about Trump it's just a an easy just just far away\nBut if you bring up the fact that Obama was truly trashing cops and law enforcement and holder was too and they're nationalizing these ah these local police departments and some of the really reckless things that they said whether it was ... center

[noise]\nThis is going to be a one party town and will be like Chicago or Baltimore where you don't have different voices you know speaking up and and working\nFor our local region and so I think it's really important that we have a voice that it's going to be able to work with the administration for priorities for the northern Virginia\nNow here's here's your opponent West is not just a Democrat and I will be fine she's a radical she will join the radicals in the house of representatives I mean the hard core radicals reopen border radicals the mass\nOf government radicals and so forth and so on and I'm Nancy\nPelosi is put in over a million dollars in the race and now Bloomberg's coming in and doing two million because they saw what we saw in our polling which is the racist tied very close\nAnd they kept saying they thought they had it all put away but I'll tell you we're we're in here we're fighting because if we can get this great record that we have of you know growing the economy getting more people back to work um you know passing the opioid legislation that the president signed this week at the White House\nThat I was there with Democrats and Republicans celebrating that we got this national emergency in the opioid crisis six billion dollars that were doing to help\nAnd the press doesn't want to talk about that so I appreciate you being a place where we talk about issues and the good things that we're getting done for the country and my opponent opposes this agenda and just wants to resist were about results there about resistance I'm about you know getting things\nThat improve the quality of life in advance our economy protect you know our citizens public safety I been endorsed by the police benevolent association but I've also been endorsed by and supported by the federal employees pack as well as every business group involved so I brought together a diverse coalition\nWhat what kind of groups of back your opponent\n[noise] um well the uh the the metro union group that as a running an attack\nOut I keep threatening to shut down the um the metro in the Washington DC area and violate yeah and violate the law\nAnd they're attacking me for not raising taxes so my opponent attacks me and then people like this ... this is a union that was so you know that's functional that the Obama administration support it suited\nAnd that to supporting her and and other union groups but she hasn't gotten you know any business endorsements she wouldn't even sit down interview with the police benevolent association and this is someone she put\nHer own staffing to fake parties city costumes for police in or out to imply that she had the support of the police when in fact the police have endorsed and supported me because of my record on\nPublic safety on let me\nLet me ask you this before we run out of time roads big deal in northern Virginia [noise] on there's a lot of road construction going on and that's even before the president pushes through an infrastructure program but she's a heavy duty tax or on the toll road is she\nWas she was ... that there is forty six dollar told that you see when you're ... you're going to Washington she was for them before she was against them and you know she was on the committee that you know that they put through that but more importantly is she saying she was against them\nYet Terry McAuliffe who put that into place how she was ineffective in persuading him now you look at something where I Know we might disagree on this but I really advocated for the I'm a pay raise for our federal employees and the president and you know the administration initially was going to do a pay freeze\nAnd I went to them politely and made my case and talked about why it was important that the people who you know at the FBI or the CIA all this you know that they got their pay raises so they can do the good work they did and\nYou know arresting vis a character that they are not today and so um I work politely with the administration on that she was ineffective and getting Terry McAuliffe to do anything I'm In and get rid of those forty six dollar toes and so we need someone who's affected\nWho can work with you know a Republican administration or Democrats I've demonstrated that and and I've always been someone advocating lower taxes Terry and public safety which is why I'm thrilled to have the support of our police and\nI Do uh you are in a tough district to marginal districts\nIn what they're hoping of course is that they can scare the hell out of everybody in northern Virginia\nA particularly the federal workers and others\nAnd the teachers are the usual unions and so forth to turn those people out to what they've done and the Democratic party is they have selected the most extreme radical Nancy Pelosi like candidate they possibly could\nAnd they're hoping to turn the entire area blue so it's crucially important\nLet me speak to all of a nights out there many conservatives out there as well I don't know it is crucially important that you come out and vote up and down the ticket and you come out and vote for Barbara Comstock\nUm she may not be as conservative as you like but she's not a radical cook like the like her opponent who clearly is and I've known you for decades and I know you're a person of integrity and\nWell yes and I've known you for decades and I know you're a person of integrity and ethics\nAnd I think it's very important that uh that the people come out and vote for you conservatives moderates independents that the Republican Party unite as the Republican Party's uniting all over the country because this is a different kind of election I'll give you a sixty more seconds\nWell I I thank you mark for highlighting

a little more elaborate on that\nWell Mohammed bin Salman a king found man ... was not originally supposed to be crown prince\nOr his cousin Mohammed bin Nayef was supposed to be crown prince and there are a lot of forces inside the kingdom that would like to see him become crown prince including a lot of forces\nOr in the United states that don't like Mohammed bin Salman man and they're trying to score points with this I mean\nI guess it's normal uh assuming could she'll be what's killed we have no proof that he was killed we we're assuming he was\nA but once again a lot of the noise that's coming out on that it's coming out from the forces that oppose Mohammed bin Salman man the forces that I'm opposed President Trump because President Trump is aligned with Monica ... man and with with king sol man I'm\nAnd taken out little bags while he was still alive all this though alleged Edward this is a mess don't you agree\nYeah I Do I Do and yet as a journalist and I also listen to your um indignation I'm at six twenty six Fifteen [laughter] on the air and I was nodding in agreement with pretty much everything you said but\nI'm the implications of what is done about it are you know ah they they affect a lot of people maybe even everyone um and also as a journalist my reaction is\nNot to let something go by ... with people saying so many things that are not true I'm at and I'm not including you and not a buck or something\nCaught my eye I was looking at a daily brief article I don't even know who owns the Daily Beast these days not that we ever get to start with but at least it was tied with Newsweek at some point [noise]\nUm and an article by Kimberly Dozier for whom uh I I Would I I Know from a CBS she um was injured in Iraq\nAnd I took a long time to recover and I I don't want to criticize her or anything but anyway her story it's very interesting because she quotes David Ignatius the Washington Post\nEditorial it um if you want to call in that I don't know what we should call them really\nBut never mind calling him anything I Know he's Armenian and I'm Armenian to sell out I'll be nice to him and and not say anything bad\nHe mentions a Jamal ... ties to the Muslim Brotherhood\nWhich I Know because I talked to him for repeatedly over the last ten years and all I have to do is listen to somebody's comment to tell you that they sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood which which is fine I don't\nPersonally have anything against people who sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood but I don't like the Muslim Brotherhood myself and I had people criticize me for being biased while that's a good biased I I think I I did that with pride a specially after what happened in the middle east and what happened in Egypt\nAnd which got ... covered by people like David Ignatius but anyway never mind that let's just go to quickly to what he said he calls the Muslim Brotherhood\nA secret underground fraternity that wanted to purge the Arab world of corruption and autocratic rule it saw as the legacy of western colonialism okay I mean that's a nice way of looking at it um but\nUh they've also tried to seize power in Arab countries going back I think it's as long ago was Nineteen forty eight\nThese power in Arab countries going back I think is as long ago was Nineteen forty eight or they kill the Egyptian prime minister of the time\nUm I think his name was across she ... she people remember that but anyway they've also gone on a rampage than burned the opera house here in Cairo 'em when they didn't get their way back in the Nineteen forties I guess also\nI'm and I'm all you have to do is look at how they tried to seize power or institutionalize their power\nAfter they won the election here in Egypt\nUm to see that they were trying to stay in power forever and I have a friend um from college who I must say works for something called the Arabia foundation which is\nI'm tied to Saudi Arabia and I personally have no ties to that foundation north to Saudi Arabia or take any money from either and all I Know of of Alisha happy is that he was a classmate of mine that prints then in Nineteen eighty one\nBut anyway he said it better than anyone could he said the Muslim Brotherhood believes in one man one vote one time and I think everybody out during the middle East that knows anything about them would say that that's true yes they believe in democracy one time you vote one time\nAnd you can't get rid of them ever ever again unless you have the military step in as we had here in Egypt which got totally miss covered by the American media\nBut just look at guys up the Muslim Brotherhood which is a Hamas\nHas been in power there since they seized power in two thousand and and I believe it was two thousand and then seven I Can't remember if I could have been two thousand and six but anyway\nThey have done everything possible to dislodge them and they're still they're still firing rockets into Israel and\nI mean you can argue that the Israelis fire at them that's true that's not the point though they were not elected they seized power and they refused to allow the Palestinian prime minister to come to Gaza\nThey refused to allow the European Union monitors to man the border posts\nAre and then they complain that the places under a blockade which is which is a perfectly legitimate if you consider the fact that they're not observing the um Israeli pullout agreement that was signed saying that you need European Union border\nMonitors in order to keep the border posts open but anyway uh it says uh getting back to David Ignatius he writes\nShowcase the quote was moving toward his mentor belief\nThat democracy and freedom where the Arabs best hope of purging the corruption and misrule he despised okay perhaps he despised corruption and Mitch role but he supported the Muslim Brotherhood which is of course not a reason to kidnap him and chop them up into little pieces if that's what happened and I'm not saying\nThat to defend the people who would chop them up and take them out in doggy bags or by\nUh the the Muslim Brotherhood I I'm looking at all the people making noise on Twitter about ... ... and three quarters of them belong to the Muslim Brotherhood or sympathize with it and they stand to gain a lot or if Mohammed bin Salman falls and not only that\nThey stand to gain someone who sympathizes with them in power in Saudi Arabia because the other crown prince who was in power are before he he took control in June of last year\nUm Mohammed bin Nayef from what I hear it's also sympathizes with the Muslim Brotherhood and also has good ties with Qatar which sympathizes with the Muslim Brotherhood so this is the problem here in the west is not in our interests to support people who support the Muslim Brotherhood because\nThey are trying to a point in a autocracies Islamic\nAutocracies or that will be there forever and to promote their rigid version of Islam and they say that about everybody else but their version is is just as Richard if not more so so I think people need to ask that question and I'm not hearing anyone say that in the media\nAnd especially watching David Ignatius\nWhite washed the Muslim Brotherhood in this article he wrote um it it makes me irate because the one thing I must say from here in the middle east from last thing I say the only thing I say is the Muslim Brotherhood is not good and people in the U.S\nHave supported it in the past I won't say the name of the president before President Trump who did so for the CIA director before President Trump who did so but I think the public should put their foot down and say we don't want anyone supporting this group\nThe Muslim Brotherhood is behind as you pointed out and really rainy and uh a lot of bad things that go on around the world and you're right oh you have to do is look to the Arab Spring in Egypt and\nWhat a mess that was now there are Muslim Brotherhood people that are elected in various situations are there to actually hold office in\nA democracy and various parliaments and so you just can't make believe they don't exist but I Do agree with you a hundred percent\nI'm not sure where Ignatius was going with this article I really don't even know what the purpose of it was because these are not our allies and they're not very helpful people so I agree with that and I'm getting a lot of Texas here in tweets about\nBasically you know look this guy was not a journalist and he was a columnist or this or that or I don't think it matters ever went to ... ... you did for a living what does matter that he was living in the United states it was the Saudis citizen he went into a\nConsole to get a piece of paper and like the Roach Motel he never came out you don't bother me about this said would the brazen manner in which it was executed\nI mean if they really wanted something like this they wanted this guy I think there were other ways they could do it but this was pretty brazen I mean we are their ally we have done lots of the Saudis I don't like the fact we're involved in the\nEnd of the civil war as you know I think we need to get out of that and I have since the first day a bomb and got us in\nBut it was very brazen and it was like basically you know we can do whatever we want because we made a deal with Trump\nAnd that's the way it appears to the world right now and there is no bigger Trump supporter in the country then the guy you're talking to right now I Believe I Am a true believer in the president and his America First policies and defend them virtually seven days a week\nAcross all sorts of platforms as you know I'll just hearing otherwise\nBut I don't think he can sweep this under the rug and simply say you know well it's just not a big deal people get\nKilled by governments all the time it shouldn't jeopardize anything I mean this is one of those high profile things that were that is beyond me that MPs allegedly would allow this to happen and sanction it and now we understand that they rogue general that might have been involved\nGetting more businesses to expand are getting more companies started\nThat that was eventually going to pay for the tax cuts themselves much like the Arthur Laffer tax cuts curve back in the Nineteen seventies under Reagan and early Nineteen eighties where he actually decrease taxes and revenues went up the debt went up\nBecause he was running out spend as Sylvia said at the time\nSo my question is in the short term debts gone up do you see that coming down as the economy continues to expand\nYeah yeah I mean and that's the only way it will come down is with economic growth right and so that again she failed to offer any account of how the Democrats would generate economic growth and their anti business\nIt hurt her responses last night were all about evil corporations one after the other right and so there's corporate overreach and the big 'cause we have to we have to fight to make sure the small business person gets represented better up in DC\nBut it that much different than being anti business into revenues are up four percent this year and Virginia's coffers are overflowing as well but spending is up eight percent\nAnd as I said debate last night right the tax cuts or a hundred and fifty billion this year\n[noise] and so if you grow at four percent that's paid for right about what's not paid for is to get the budget we had to plus up spending four hundred billion not a hundred and fifty million for the tax cuts for a hundred billion in spending none of which is paid for getting nine Senate Democrat votes\nBits of it is confusing the people that we have the house and the Senate and the White House we do\nBut in the Senate you need to get sixty votes for the budget and to get those nine votes we've lost up the military and yet\nOur budget with Paul Ryan last year we did twelve approach bills they were pretty good still spending way too much but one way better than what the Democrats have and so but the Democrats to talk about debt and deficit it it it it they're just living on another planet\nAnd I've got a couple of a Texas questions here one from Rob in Chesterfield who says please ask the congressmen how do we pay for making Internet available to everyone in rural areas\nYeah well that's we there are grants available I brought that had an FCC down to the district the first year I was and\nAnd uh we we got a grant in orange county they've got a super innovator solution that will be a model for the other counties Louis says building towers but that that is right it should be part of our infrastructure plan that the kids to drive to like Donald's\nOr to be able to do their homework ... that's not good that run information flow these days\nThat that is the technology of the future and we we have to get that done and so that\nWe need an infrastructure package that the Democrats did a trillion dollar infrastructure package rubber back ... years right and no shovel ready jobs nothing happened right and so that's not the way to go I I think under Trump he gets construction or he gets on time delivery and I think we can do that and have a great product coming up in the next two years\nWhen you say grants are you talking about the state federal government I mean who pay federal\nWe've got a federal grant for ah Orange County and died of working out the the fed scooped up the payment to orange since I've been writing letters on their behalf over the past month or to try and get the check because they're already under construction for rural broadband but it's good news\nStand from Richmond says if you get reelected heard of the Republican's plan on raining in spending\nYeah well that that's the million dollar question and you know my opponent a critique me last night but it contradicted yourself 'cause I did vote against the budget because of the overspending\nAnd so the the the way you rein in standing is send up representatives who represent you and who will not vote for budgets that are out of whack and so I I've been a strong advocate on that I voted I've taken the tough\nVotes I get in trouble with my leadership on that once in a while\nBut I I ran I deaths and deficits an economic growth together and so I I I'm On the budget committee I've fought hard for the spending side but we need more wraps who will hang in there with us and we always get outmaneuvered by the Democrats at the end of the day right in order at the end that Iraq right up to Christmas right when that budget gets produced right\nThat everyone wants to blow out of dodge and I've been on the show you know numerous times on how the process works and it it it's almost intentional\nCongressman you were outraged by spanberger in this quarter almost three to one are you going to be able to be financially competitive here in the final Twenty one days\nYeah if you would have told me I raised ... million dollars and a quarter\nI Would have been amazing and happy as can be and so we get our message out right if if she has five billion dollars or you know in the same things that are not true and that don't appeal to voters\nThat that can be overcome very easily all you have to tell the truth give a positive account of your results until we have plenty of money to get an accurate account of what people in the seventh district want\nA you know if we didn't have that money to unfortunately that is the problem right if you don't have the money to go up on TV cause that Democrats on the mainstream media as well you you won't get an accurate account of what happened in that debate last night from the mainstream media for example that got scanned you know the the papers and then watched the debate yourself\nAnd see if the reporting in the Richmond Times dispatch for the Washington Post is what you saw on that video\nAnd uh so it's tough being a Republican about all the policy we win a right of people just voted on policy we went outside you can\nSo both of us agree that you did very well last night\nWhen the ten\nSo both of us agree that you did very well last night in the debate I tell you one of the debate hands down again because I didn't think spanberger put together a message that had an eco he's into it\nWhy not more debates I mean where are you cap and dissidents single debate I don't understand that\nYou know we we didn't cap but we had one fall through I I Can't go into too much detail other than to say\nA as a moderator was fired and upset the second debate plant so we're we're working on that and a reporter was fired for probably doing news stories on a in a balanced way and so what\nThat is problematic so we're we're working on the details and we'll work through them I I haven't kept anything yet\nAnd I I did want to draw people's attention today to Politico article\nIt's on it's on political right now\nAt that frames the Nancy Pelosi liberal agenda\nAs well as you can do right that's what I was talking about last night that political Politico article on line everybody gets to play but from my opponent and every Democrat nationwide and you can watch the debates see her go issue by issue by issue to all that money coming in she's trying to run as a moderate\nAnd hide from her positions at the Democrat positions are all their their her position on\nRight\nSame the same is on the website it on our own website\nAnd so it's fascinating to see the wind up above the Nancy Pelosi playbook and then my opponents strategy it's a one for one match\nI've only got a minute because you have to go so it gets too quick question with thirty second answers so is my radio debate which was debate number three is is that still in play\nYeah yeah everything's still in play and I think I Am late for my next interview John\nOr just just one quick answer sure\nOne thing you learned about Abigail Spanberger last night that you really liked one thing\nYeah sure where her dedication to the country working at the CIA and uh she's she's a mom in it by you know in my neighborhood area that the you know loves her kids and wants to serve the country and that that's a huge commitment anyone that's willing to follow that calling\nI commend for their service\nAll right we're all the time more information Dave Brat

from\nIt came from them those white slave owners\nAlthough Franklin ever owned slaves but you get the point\n\nThat for freedom of the press came from freedom and the press and freedom of speech was synonymous\n\nAnd they were promoting a republic they were promoting individual liberty they were promoting private property rights they were fighting the ...\nPositions in viewpoints\nThey were fighting them\nAlmost every day when you read a so-called news article ditch trashing\nOur country\nNow let's go back to the first sentence of this piece on bucks America has a massive growing racial wealth gap let me ask you a question\nWhy do people risk their lives to come here\nBecause that senses telling you that America is racist and there's not equal opportunity in America that's what that senses tell us\nWhy do people of color AKA non whites why are they flooding into America\nWhy are they leave in Guatemala and Honduras and Mexico in one country after another in central and South America why are they leaving one country after another on the African continent why they leaving one country after another in Southeast Asia even China\nWhy are all these people coming to the United states if there is a massive growing racial wealth gap there is no opportunity for non whites is that it\n\nOne of the problems we have in this country thanks to the left weather in the media or entertainment and elsewhere is a lack of promoting assimilation\n\nA lack of promoting assimilation learning English learning American laws learning American practices and bracing American culture I mean after all you came to United States to escape\nThat culture of your birthplace right isn't that what a refugee is isn't that what an illegal alien does otherwise white come to America and America you see is so racist as a country\n\nThat as Brock Obama and Joe Biden used to say by twenty forty four\nWhite people will be in the minority\n\nThere so race obsessed with America is so racist white Americans allow that\nBecause America as a country is not racist that's why\nPeople should be encouraged to embrace capitalism they should be encouraged to embrace entrepreneur ship they should be encouraged to embrace the private sector the profit motive creativity productivity rather than government government government\nBecause the vast majority of people do not succeed by getting a government check\nIt destroys them it destroys initiative it destroys independent thinking it destroys the human spirit which is exactly why the left pushes so let's go back to the story\nAmerica has a massive growing racial wealth gap now for the left of course that means more government more redistribution of higher taxes more regular you know in more and more and more to government\nGoes on the median white family today holds nearly ten times the wealth of the median black family\n\nSenator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing that gap that caught my attention his idea is to get lower income kids kids\nA sizable nest egg nearly fifty thousand dollars in some cases that they could use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition\nDid you hear this where are you familiar with this\nThese they call them opportunity accounts they don't call these Marxist accounts they call them opportunity accounts [noise] what theoretically no this is the article is just a news article it doesn't say that it's an opinion piece\n\nThese opportunity accounts with theoretically make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those who grow up in wealthier homes\n\nSounds cool right equality\nIt would be a dramatic change in our country to have low income people break out of generational poverty bookers set an interview with Fox we can rapidly bring security into those families lives and that is really exciting to me\nNow that will never be any discussion of where this money comes from\nNever nobody cares\nWhat kind of taxes for it to be increased who cares\nWhat kind of additional debt will have to be accumulate who cares none of it matters we're talking about the quality of results economic equality we're not talking about liberty\nDon't confuse us with liberty don't confuse us what markets don't confuse us with opportunity no don't you see\nWe have a racist country we need to take money\nGive it to poor people poor kids up to fifty thousand dollars\nSo they can move into the middle class or see\nSimple\nOne and I think of this why didn't anybody think of this these are opportunity accounts after all ladies and gentlemen were coming into the the modern era the modern modern era\nI guess economics\nDon't matter that does it matter tax rates are irrelevant\nWe needed opportunity account of the fifty thousand dollars a kid what's the big deal at ... at it free college\nAt ... at it for your health care and while we're at it open borders\nAnd while we're at it open borders\n\nAnd why were added why don't you destroy the country\nWhere the richest country in the face of the earth or even our poor people live better than most poor people in the rest of the world they don't have local state and federal welfare systems\nFood systems\nHousing benefits they don't have them in these other countries we have him in this country thanks to the productivity of individuals who get up every morning and go to work and come back in the evening\nAnd contribute to society\nWhy do we spend all our time attacking the people who create wealth who create this magnificent society who built things who produce things who make it possible for people who don't even do those things\nTo have some form of material well food clothing and so forth you kill the

or or get on a cable show or or pop off about about this that and the other\nAnd he's his he's been sort of adjusting his message is more information comes off that comes in and as he gets more advice on what to do plus there are things going on in the middle East that he's involved in in his staff's involved in that you and I can't even imagine\nSo what do you want him to do you want to let's say the royal families guilty I Know they're guilty or cutting off all relations with them would that make you happy\nNow oh I totally agree and for a far when you step but that last thing that you just got a second ago you're right it's an investigation my mind the big point is you know it's not over yet the information number one\nAnd then make some decisions right but he keeps defending those guys the Saudis they've got a nice guy the the really bad guy they do a lot of bad stuff and wave going what do you keep the little guys\n... whether to keep defending those guys despise those guys\nHe

so focused on this\nBecause it's important it's about truth about\nHonestly it's not that important it's a horrible thing that took place a horrible thing that took place but I I hate to say this 'cause I Know it will be twisted in four thousand different ways but for the United\nStates it's simply not that important\nI mean giving a hundred and fifty billion dollars to the Iranian regime which killed which was involved in killing thousands of American Soldiers that to me is a big damn deal\n[noise] but you know the media and the ... supported that deal Obama supported\nThat deal that is a terrorist regime that is an enemy of the United states now I'm not making any excuses this man was Florida and in a horrific way great\nHorrible horrible horrible horrible but I don't know why

it\nBut we'll wait for the investigation will get all the facts you know but\nWhat are you what the president to do\nHe says that they're going to be some fear that a severe ramifications but he's not

always been on both sides of the fans and on and play with the cancer and sounding egotistical you should have somebody called me back and let you let me tell you my entire story but in order to cut it short\nA very quickly I didn't vote for Obama I uh I'm I'm probably believe in gay rights I slowly and believe in freedom of religion I fully believe that a woman's right to a woman's right to choose [noise]\nI'm I'm Down the line I but I have always been I've never been calm to what anybody tells me without my own thought process behind it\nGood and so I Am the absolute I Am that moderate that everybody wanted me over and the other side we can\nCome in you know I didn't do it is very social liberal values\nHowever I'm off on this this is most of my adult life and I voted for time thing

wing\nGuy in there and do that because this point I feel that I have a better chance\nOf converting them over to my crew value booming we hear everything we can go to get everything gets bad\nBecause they they were coming from a crowded party and what they are and he only had like family knew me\nThere by ... and her ... the problem that makes me on the ball and my idea my idea is that I Believe than\nLetting you a ... year raise a number of interesting points and it sounds like you have been very much politically involved in the bowl leaned over a long window of time\nThat you're not a typical from a lot of likely Trump voters and even the ... is typical because I'm not sure if the delineation between conservatives versus Republicans versus moderate it's really hard anymore with labels\nBut what I Will say and I see there's a lot with especially younger Republican ask voters\nWe're basically describing is that you are a social liberal but fiscally conservative and ultimately is how do you want your government to be run\nNow and the grand scheme of things if we're talking about the values that you just represented as Donald Trump likely to strip the any of those potential rights\n... from any of the the aforementioned no is Donald Trump going to be the guy to to try to to push for the elimination of of gay marriage now he's on\nOr for that matter he's even told justice to stand down when it comes to marijuana enforcement you know there he's not the most conservative guy I mean take a look at his own personal life it tells us much so you do have a lot of fiscal conservatism I'll give you an idea you know I'm I'm a little bit of a quandary\nPolitically myself I you know don't generally talk about it quite this way but I personally am quite conservative and when it comes to social values I live my life\nAs kind of like a half assed Catholic and I said I was a good Catholic wouldn't be true so I Want to be honest [laughter] so I got to have as Catholic but I you know I had here too that that kind of value system for so for example\nYou know personally I'm pro life\nBut I Believe in a libertarian form of government so when it comes to social issues I Am more inclined to\nGet the government the way for example I don't think the government should be involved at all in marriage why is it that the government dictates marriage why is it that the tax code has ever delineated based upon one marital status we've created so many issues so many issues that way\nBut didn't have to be created because we put government into the mix\nSo I Am inclined or you know it's like with marijuana a lot of people think that uh you know because I I Will rail against it like we have ... you know medical marijuana legalized in Florida which a lot of states do and you had the recreational use in several more states oh rail against it and and people are just anti marijuana no not\nI don't care about your crap as long as you keep it away from me and don't hurt anybody my issue is that it's not legal you know I I Believe again and the premise and so in the case of something like marijuana well it needs to be either legalized or as a minimum decriminalize by the ...\nLike marijuana as well and needs to be either legalized or at the minimum decriminalized by the federal government otherwise all we're doing and all these states\nLike mine is something we never knows that the United States Constitution it doesn't work that way and that's the reason that we got all this kind of horse crap stuff going on where you can't use the financial system and it creates a whole host of problems under that and you have doctors that will go\nYou know given like a winter not because you can't actually issue a prescription because by the way you're trying to issue guidance on a schedule one drug\nSo again that is I I think where you're coming from more\nOf a position that is prevalent within a Trump supporter but even maybe even a young younger\nUh is the Republican ask again butters for the lack of a better label and certainly I think people who are constitutional as so anyway ah my my heart goes out to you for having been a victim best to you and your family or and may God Bless\nAnd by the way for a hike camp in North Dakota I mean come on\nEven the high camp in North Dakota ... you're you're talking about a state that Trump won by thirty six points and her she's voted with Donald Trump approximately forty percent of the time I I mean it doesn't exactly line up with the north Dakota values\nI mean I I don't I Would tell us what to say but

Michael Moore\nDuring his weekly general audience and the St Patrick's square now I don't know the pope who doesn't read current events doesn't read newspapers\nMaybe didn't know Michael Moore was and Michael Moore simply worked his way to the front and how to what the pope as if he was having a meeting with him Michael Moore is a left wing radical extremist he's a a contributor Planned Parenthood that\nKills about three thousand developing babies every day\nContributor to Planned Parenthood that kills about three thousand developing babies every day\nHe's a ah certainly an individual that does not reflect American values hard work perseverance fear of God love of country\nSo if the pope knowingly unwittingly met with Michael Moore I got a problem with that because especially as abortion feelings but nonetheless until I find out if the pope knew who he was and it's hard to criticize him and secondly and lastly\nBig fight with a couple of weeks ago with Kevin always largely over\nBut I did some statistical work on what was one with a cabin all Brett Kavanaugh and what lies ahead the Supreme Court which I've not had the honor of repairing before takes about eighty cases a year\nAnd the nation's highest court decides another fifty cases without oral arguments general unanimously\nAnd they normally take cases where there's a conflict between the Thirteen circuits that is if the second circuit as a conflict with sex or the night with the seven they'll take a case to resolve the conflict but just keeping your mind eighty cases a year they take for oral arguments eighty cases a year\nBy contrast the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two cases in a ... month period fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two compared to eighty\nSo if you throw on top of that the millions of cases and the ... district courts\nYou're talking about maybe a million cases below the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court and handles eighty cases so whether it's the hot button issues of immigration or gun control or or crime abortion whatever it might be\nThe the ... Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of those cases are decided at the ... circuit her district court level Ninety nine above nine nine nine nine percent\nSo to break it down even further there's Thirteen U.S Circuit court of appeals of the Thirteen eight are controlled by democratic appointed judges only four by Republican in one district is split\nAnd so the most important one is the U.S court of appeals for the district of Columbia which is one Brett Kavanaugh came off of the Democratic appointees they're seven at three majority seven three one vacancies now available but that's going to be one of the stray so it was gonna say seven to three\nSo Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the federal cases are resolved before the Supreme Court level\nAnd all those about Seventy percent are controlled by democratically appointed judges so before you get too far it up about Brett Kavanaugh I Want you to all those figures in your mind Supreme Court takes eighty cases the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty two thousand cases\nDistrict court about a million and so the great majority of the action is well below the U.S Supreme Court even with Brett Kavanaugh they're the only hope we have is normal God fearing Americans as for Trump to be in office another six years\nAnd if he stays in office six more years with the Republican Senate for all six years he may get as high as Fifteen Percent of those appointed by Republican judges so that is the mountain ahead of us don't get too high don't get too low\nSo what I'm saying is if Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the case it never gets U.S Supreme court\nAnd those that do generally dealing with the conflicts whether Brett Kavanaugh Neil Gorsuch are there or not it's certainly a great thing encourage more of it but it would take years and years of Republicans controlling the Senate and Trump controlling\nThe White House or parents after Trump to make any dent and the fact that about Seventy percent of the federal judges or appointed by Democrats and the way by thirty percent bother Republicans and the reason is the last two or three years of Bush forty three Chuck Schumer refused to do anything in the Senate he shut down completely\nAnd should two weeks from Tuesday\nThe Democrat to win the U.S Senate which appears to be a pill at this point but should that happen there's going to shut it down again and they won't be any appointments for the last two years\nOf Trump's first term in office I said first term\nContinuous more fun becomes available we have two lines open to be calling out seven seven three one two three one one eight seven seven three one two three one one bill Cunningham the great American in for the great ones [noise] mark Levin\nListen to what David as from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nI have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done ... absolutely right I truly love my ... and I know you will to trust me once you feel how much support the ex chair provide\nYou'll never want to sit in an ugly uncomfortable office chair again and your business owners ex chairs or the perfect investment that take the productivity of your entire team to the next level ex chairs on sale now for one hundred dollars off go to ... dot com now that's extra L.

Johnson ambushed and fired upon and killed a group of Dallas texas police officers to civilians are also wound\nHe stated impose things that the reason he killed the cops who was retribution for the number of times cops have killed African American men so he thought out officers to kill who he perceived to be white and he murdered them in cold blood using semi automatic weapons and then went on a course killed himself\nNow it's a big story same thing happened Baton Rouge same thing happened with the re most in blue officers in New York City\nAnd there is a regular event in our country where police officers or gun down not because of the color of their skin but the color of their uniform which is blue\nWhat is it and the national consciousness\nOccasion by the national media that causes such other disrespect for police officers that weak minded nationalist and other hate filled individuals many mentally ill will take it upon themselves to hunt down officers to kill the murder without good reason\nI I I like to see media coverage of that event tell me why that is going on and tell me why the president of United States\nBrock Hussein Obama wouldn't knowingly and willingly repeatedly made in the oval office with representatives of a group who would advocate the murder of those same police officers black lives matter del Rey McCann soon and others\nWhen they march around in Dallas and elsewhere what are we one dead cops wouldn't even want them now we want to kill cops\nPigs in a blanket crime like bacon\nOr what is it and so when we obsess over the death of Jamal cause Yogi at CNN and other news organizations are now doing it's terrible that I guess his fingers are cut off\nHe was decapitated it was butchered awful Assad citizen killed in Turkey and the worst way give it to imagine it needs to do\nBut the only way the media will focus on a murder itself that murder can be used against Donald Trump or Mitt Romney or George Bush or some other Republican tell me how this murder so the murder of Jason Allison barge down Kentucky butchered murdered\nOn an exit ramp at two o'clock in the morning leaving his wife Amy and two beautiful kids without a husband without a father there's no political benefit for CNN nothing that can't they can't use\nThe same way with the the murder of re most in New York City or the cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge advocate the murder welcome to the White House a group that advocates the killing of cops and get them into the White House get their pictures taken with the president\n[laughter] how's that possible so when the media obsesses over Jamal could choking it's done not because his life had more value that officers rained most in lieu\nIt's done because they can use that to ask the question is America complicit did the sides by some condominiums from Trump\nDecides go to a hotel near the White House to get Trump money it's all this crap in their heads losing out horse manure coming out of their ears as if it's murder has so much more important than the unsolved murder of police officers inside of America\nAnd it's sick and some others continue with more as we can tell you my producer rich cement is going to

are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then ah with us I said look\nWe want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're called me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and it has said that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately after the plan and came over and talk to now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with um I can tell you they want to sure but\nTalk to now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with um I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the building where\nFive hundred million a year five trillion or pretend we felt Shanghai we built Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airports they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's got to come back to America\nJust show right so China's been taking that five hundred billion dollars you know people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President Xi but I said we can't do a version of but we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've now put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs and by the way there's been no impact has been\nNo effect not what people do say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it's at twenty five percent\nSo it would take it and billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the product here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we\nUsed to do it so China has been look China's the biggest of them all by far probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over bill\nLeslie wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart it's a wonderful life I look at Bedford Falls\nBelow sea takes the house Schumer Texas Senate your life becomes miserable the last two years what are you said or middle class Americans all over the country that say you know what\nWe don't want Bedford Falls away it looks we want the New Bedford falls what do you say to those who say they met terms for lack of take it easy not important Renee say whether it's black burner Heller we don't have to worry about that what do you say to motivate the base\nWell I Hope one day she's going to do well first of all he's a great guy but I I just say just country what just forget it ...\nYou have to go out and vote my phone numbers are so good but a lot of people say I'm not running so we're not going to vote one percent Rasmussen fit we know we're doing great and and then they say you can add a lot to it because what people hang up and they say we don't want to talk to you that means that said Trump phone record of that's good or bad but that's what it means a we have to\nDo well I Will say I think we're going to do very well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice cabinet Fifteen Fifteen to judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly sure when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five it will be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice Kevin are because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the man of great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn under the law banana consequences because since I've had many women were spurred my air you know bill I with Kevin they don't want to say publicly but if you ... and ... in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican base or otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nHave been a great friend of mine and I appreciate it you've been a very terrific guy it's also a terrific talent you know a lot of people can't do what you do you know this is talk with others Russian about a ... not too many and Sean is you know showing us great\nBut these are great people in great talents and I appreciate it do we have to do well I think we're going to do well in the Senate I think we could pick up some seats in the Senate and suppose if you look three weeks ago and you look now\nIt's like especially black river walk her well she was she was ... points down now she's four or five points up Marcia

talks about you know it's amazing except as only during this period of time at six weeks after it's over so it's one of those things but\nI Hope it does well and uh I Hope that Steve\nDoes well I think he's doing well for example to when I hear is doing so I think that's very important and I'm here for him but I just want to thank you for everything you've done and and hopefully people are going to realize that just a very important election the terms I think\nFrankly I think people are viewing this as very important you know usually midterms are like sleepers people that they are energized and for those that say that the\nThat the blue is energized bringing the Democrats and we're not ... I think personally I think we're more energized you're not going to believe the energy well we had it in Erie, Pennsylvania the other night with twenty five thousand people outside of a twelve thousand of their way and it's been amazing\nAnd if that kind of you know action shows up\nIn three weeks and you imagine it's just a little more than three\nWe got the energy for the next three weeks because you're like Elvis\nLow I put you could only move this big equipment so often rock cafe and Secret Service and all of that but they were very very busy and we're going to the races that are close or slightly ahead or slightly behind and we'll make it a lot of ...\nBecause the president you're the best you're a great American to say that all the time you but you're a great America keep doing what you're doing for the voices you don't hear in the face as you don't see those people you're the hero I was with Reagan an eighty four when he came here I thought Reagan was the star he was the Rolling Stones or the Beatles\n... you're on the Ed Sullivan show I'm Serious about but I really do appreciate your support such an important voice and you've been with us and uh then I'll just say hello to all your people you have a lot of all you're a great America thank you thank you very much for thank you\nConstantly counting at Mr President thank you very much I'm sure we'll do it again I'm very honored to have you in office and now we're so much better off than we would have been a Hillary Clinton and one starts continue with more built counting the great American in for the great one mark Columbian [noise] hard\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead forth\nThe word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction the easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go well my friend Dr Larry on President of Hill's college says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer\nLet me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nHad Hillsdale they understand that true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is fourth he'll still students are challenged to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nAnd they learn the meaning of the three ultimate and related things the good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution ... for Hillsdale dot com that's L.

thoughts are on\nThis why how accurate where the pose the greatest polling in the world was done in twenty sixteen dozens of polls all the experts all the pundits that was a done deal and I'll tell

months ... months I had among several times and junior says to me you know my nicknames willy willy or we could have won this thing\nAnd I said what do you mean is that where we never had cases in Ohio we never had Rubio and Bush in Florida never had Walker in Wisconsin we couldn't get by in Michigan but you know we could have won this thing\nAnd so the Trump campaign believed on election day they were going to lose because they pay more attention to the polls that ... to the crowds and when you talk to the president he'll tell you that he went to Michigan like one AM in the morning on election day morning and it was packed with thirty thousand people\nEverywhere Trump went and I I'm In a state of Ohio\nAre unlike your state there there's a presidential campaign in Ohio every year that truly unbelievable so I saw the ads I saw the commercials are Hillary came through Trump came through\nAnd there were there was no comparison to the excitement that Trump cause as opposed to Hillary so all the polling in Ohio head of Hillary winning five to ten percentage points\nOut that turn out\nWell I Know that side that you know we have a huge turned around and the house that gets forty see but uh\nYou know at twenty traders twenty three states the Republicans have a twenty three seated bench\nRide it I mean we're amazing winning streak America and I think uh you know the Republicans shut will listen to this negative messaging at just get out and say yeah we're going to win both the house and Senate no problem\n... if you're a Democrat what are you running on it in the

companies which are thousands thousands of them are just Monsanto do have all these illegal aliens are ready to come walk for months at a low wages\nI I'm not disputing that I'm not out to let me let me say this real quick let's go back something you said the beginning and then and then we'll continue on on your your your turn it on your own thing I don't act like all legal immigrants are are coming here to break laws I Know they are\nOkay\nEvery moment and we're still with facts not emotions okay is it a fact that if you come into the country illegally every moment of every day whether you're sleeping working whatever it may be that you are breaking the laws of the United states of America\nAre you going to do this\nBut I went on even when they get Michael Michael it's a simple questions on a trick question you called me okay I I didn't call you the idea that you knew you were going to say that again answer my question you act like it is um some how ridiculous that\nI say that every illegal immigrant is a law breaker that is their intent to break American law that's when they break into this country and they don't solve the paperwork and tried to come in this country is an actual legal migrants which I have no problem with you try to act like the the breaking of the law is\nNot breaking the law so you say well I Know all you all you talk show host you act like these people were all wall breakers\nThey actually are Michael I'm not saying they all have the intent to ... to rape or to murder I Do think they all have they intend to steal cars they're stealing from America when they come in this country legally they're stealing from the American worker they're stealing jobs they're not paying taxes the right way many\nOf them under cut jobs and make money in cash and the number one stimulant Mexico's economy is illegal immigrants who take the money and send it back to Mexico so to act as if the action of breaking into a country is it means that you're not a lawbreaker ... is absolute auditor insanity\nSo I'll start back with a question you ... you said that all you talk show host act like these people are breakers I'm not I I'm not the one that made the all the law is the law Michael the law says you cannot come into this country illegally\nBy that definition they are all breaking the law when they're here the entire time there he\nLaw that says the companies lied on fast though and it's legal for them to hire illegal alien\nI'm In favor of e verify I'm In favor also of going after those that hire illegals I've said for a long time if you want to clean up this country and get rid of illegal immigrants you don't have to deport any of them all you have to do is start seizing hotels restaurants\nCars equipment on job sites when you find people that are working and employing people illegally\nI agree with you we have a problem with hiring illegal immigrants but you have a bigger problem is that you believe that these illegal immigrants or somehow not breaking our wall when they come across the border illegally and you act like it's at propaganda when it's not it's fact it is propaganda to treat people\nLike they are doing nothing wrong when in fact they're breaking our laws that is propaganda starting\nFortune of all with all these companies that hire really loyalists outcome start\nSo let me get a straight Michael why can't we start enforcing the law the way the president wants to do which is start enforcing the law at the border so these people don't even have the opportunity to come in this country illegally and then get work illegally why why are you still get hit out\nWhy people like that but when it comes to federal federal level all these other constituents there you know the politicians honey how big is Monsanto\nI I look I don't know how much money they make I don't know why you're keep focusing on one single employer there's there's there's Fifteen million illegal immigrants in this country maybe even more than that I'm giving it a low number here\nThere are thousands tens of thousands of companies you know I'm not I'm not saying you're crazy listen to what I'm saying let's focus on one employer one person let's focus on the factors tens of thousands of employers in America then employ illegal immigrant labor labor\nBy agree it's a problem but if you cut off\nThe flow of the illegal immigrant Les ... immigrant labor then that is a great starting point to get this under control why would you know it's a two part solution I Am in favor of that but when you have four thousand plus people coming here border right now\nThe president's job and and they're broadcasting it live on social media\nThey're literally walking with the middle finger to this country saying we don't care about your laws and were coming into your country and we're going to work in your country and we're going to undercut your wages and we're going to hurt the American worker and there's nothing you can do to stop us and this is how arrogant we are screw you America\nThat is the president's job\nTo make sure that those people are in handcuffs if they cross our border and immediately sent home\nAs far as far as that a news story or whatever it is a milestone now is that was rehearsed I Would say I want to go as far as saying that the Democratic party at that rehearsed\nOf course they do Michael I this is all propaganda for them in terms this is all propaganda for the midterms Democrats want to come out and say we love people we love it\nThis is all propaganda for the midterms Democrats want to come out and say we love people we love illegal immigrants we Nancy Pelosi the only time she basically get pissed off as if you were actually advocating\nFor a ... if you were trying to be a law and order president or a law and order congressmen that's about the only time that an suppose he really gets mad at you because she stands up for the illegal immigrant now the American worker she stands up for people to break the law and not be able to abide by the wall\nAnd then she threatens people when you get in her weight just like she did this week\nDonald Trump without a minute by minute ago hey down on it you know remember when they threw a big party at the White House\nAnd this is coming from Nancy Pelosi celebrating them passing\nTheir bill to get to get protections for people with preexisting conditions I mean she's talking right now about health care to try to move away from the other issue which is she's threatening the American worker the American family with her propaganda which is to give it legal immigrants the ability to come into this country illegally\n\nAnd ... and do that with no repercussions and it's for one reason she desperately needs them to be able to vote\nThat is what this is actually about the Democrats are terrified that they're not going to win back the house and Senate and they were gonna do it before they did they say character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh and it woke up conservatives who honestly we were kind of a sleep\n\nWe had a big when we think are Donald Trump's doing a good job I maybe I won't worry about voting\nAnd they woke up a bunch of you and I believe without the Brett Kavanaugh character assassination we would have definitely lost the Senate I think now we're headed in the right direction\nIt's not over yet but I think we're at least had in the right direction and Democrats are terrified\nThat they're not going to get the house the Senate and they need new voters in this country 'cause they don't have enough right now to win this thing I mean they want to I mean Hillary Clinton lost the Donald Trump you don't think\nThey're freaking out right now and they need new voters and the way to do is get illegals in here and given manage to amnesty and then they know they can win every national election\n\nWill get what bet to the fake Hispanic guy who wasn't even allowed to join the Hispanic caucus I mean
