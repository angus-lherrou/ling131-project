they're holding and get in the hell out of here\nAnd that's the most incredible thing of all roads that they come into this country with no gratitude the way our ancestors came by to talk about it Ellis Island they would never have carried flags from their home countries they were seeking freedom they were ... staking a new life\nThe whole point and it's so discouraging when they come here they bring a lot of the same culture in terms of even voting for people like try to get away from the get away from governments we try to tell them what to do with their lives and they both the same thing when they get here let's go to Paul in Littleton, Colorado Paul you're on with mark\nHey mark veteran taking my call Sean hey I wanted\nTo follow up on your comment earlier about the term illegal alien a button and a different a vein a you know the advocates of amnesty and high levels of immigration of always described the\nIllegal alien population is one made up of otherwise law abiding people who've done nothing more than cross the border illegally mhm\nFor the reality is is that they're coming here for jobs\nIn order to find a job they've got to fill out an ionized foreign when they do that and say they're here legally they commit perjury which is a felony or the other thing is is that they routinely make up Social Security numbers or feel somewhat Social Security numbers\nA surfer Immigration Studies suggest that about Seventy five percent\nOf the illegal aliens are here\nTo work uh have been violating these laws but nobody ever mentions it or not otherwise law abiding it's simply a myth or my daughter was actually a victim of a I D theft by illegal alien using her Social Security number was restored and when she was a child\nMhm so uh I don't know why the uh conservatives Republicans don't\nPush back on this whole illegal thing a fight by describing what's happening here in internally when people come here to work [noise]\nYeah just a one one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me\nThere's got to be an orderly procedure that house someone gets into a country we call the legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to to the people you want to give the opportunity to\nSeem so obvious to me and that's why you have to have the when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been\nA terrific a boost to the United states of America yeah legal immigrants but you changed the language let's go to Rick in

real point is I thought you were getting too they aren't all good people that they are they're going to be terrorists among them they're going to be people that don't value the ideals that we do in the United states of America forgive me even people with disease right they haven't been ... as one caller pointed out so you have\nTo have some means of doing this some orderly process that's the whole point his argument seems such such an easy one to win if you frame it in the right terms use the right language you know be compassionate people okay you want to come to this country I think we let a million people in a year\nThere's a way to do it here the rules here the procedures you have to follow them which President Trump to Republicans are going to lose this when either way right you call out the national guard or whatever you do you stop them from coming in what you got to do your evil bad guys as Obama said ripping children away from their mothers and everybody joins in with that right\nAnd if you uh don't stop them you have an invasion you have people coming in these people aren't coming in for some of that may be as some of them but a lot of them we know that kind of I

that's where we're going\nOur year will be over ten days hard to believe well hopefully\nWe finished the year strong will leave that to the lord and I know that he has no just so many of you are so many powerful ways we have been blessed in such a big way we are so grateful I Do know this and I don't want to say\nI'm looking at is what it is and I'm going to be truthful about it we are obvious this year again going to finish in a block\nWe never had a year in the raid to the house and then nine wise close must admit I panic a little bit to death and and I remember it well and then I was very um\nWell I Wish I were painted from my lack of faith because who came out just fine\nAnd uh this year is not going to be any different but um God continues to know each so any of you to give and you know I'm I've said this before but I'm so humbled\nWhen you all get to this ministry not mainly because I Can't believe I I Believe with all my heart that if you give to this ministry you're doing it because you believe in what God has done you believe or God is due\nIn one of these days you're going to get more powerful feel for exactly what he's done and what do you do is we we get that out to you and him better and bigger detail\nBut it is amazing that we're doing here in the ministry and um but more importantly I'm humble because he's a nudge you God as you know just you\nTo be is it certainly\nTo keep us on the air and to keep this ministry growing so we only ways you know so many opportunities\nHe is\nSeeing that he raises up the funds\nTo help us with all that as well to help us get to that place where he obviously what do you like us to get too so it's ... it's very exciting and we will be in that block this year of course we want to finish strong\nSo we've got ten days eleven days to finish a strong hope we do\nBut um I you know I\nKnow that I could get on the air saying we're going to go off the air and we're about out of money we're going to be in you know a trouble all those things and you want\nOut of money and we're going to be and you know a trouble and all those things and you want to keep us on the air I could say all those things but that would not be true we're going to be fine\nYou're stuck with me for another year at least I'm and we'll ... we'll see but um we've got a lot of a big things coming up this year particularly as we prepare\nTo build out a new studio and of course the expense with that is far more than um I I if I shutter to even think about so we're we're doing that in face\nKnowing their God that God has raised up this opportunity I Believe this is of God to do it and I think he's going to take care of us so um we're not getting ahead of them are going to raise a we're going to wait and so we have all the money if we have to stop in the middle we will do that\n... okay yeah I mean it's I mean there's a growing oh yeah\nYeah yeah I Would keep it I don't know how you know if you want to keep it that's fine I mean your other option of course would be too if you move it then you've got a um diversify it when do you think you're going to be calling on the money using it\nI I've been using it\nOh okay well then yeah I Would definitely keep it where it is\nOkay right up much ratio really pretty gutless you\nThank you Tom uh let me go to a let me\nYou know what let me just answer a couple of questions on YouTube that we're right back to the phones phones are aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three\nI'm\nCraig thank you drags just make it a comment on that particular stock or it is a great dogs ... very well um\nAnd and ah today you know maybe a good day to start you know to add to it a little bit but anyway great great company [noise] um let's see Tony asking me or if I said did you say\nThe forty four a was a foundational stock no I did not say that I say I was we were talking about or another stock there was foundation or wasn't he forty four though\nI'm don't remember what it was but it wasn't he forty four I'm so\nA ... oh I I Know what it was yeah no it wasn't it was in a wasn't even a a EnergyStar now we're talking about I remember yeah we talked about the same color or that stock but that's not the one that was the foundation of stock\nOr Dan is saying uh our preferred preferred valued\nWent inherited at the market or the ... you know\nA preferred words are always\nPart value that never changes now\nThe ... the value of the price can go down or up does the where it is right now if it's cold it's always going to get called at par value\nIf you inherited it and when you when Harry did it it was Seventeen dollars a share and the poor values twenty five then and you sell it\nThen you still have you know a stepped up bases so your costs space is going to be whatever the person you are an area that from bought it\nSo from a cost basis standpoint that's how you would figure so if they bought it at twenty five and a Seventeen when you inherited it or not when you inherited boat or a ... on the date of death of the person near a narrative from\nThen yes that would Seventeen dollars would be you were costs basis so if it's now at twenty and you sell it you would have capital gains tax\nOf that the three dollars per share so uh but when it gets called going to get called at twenty five I\nSomeone's asking me Dan I'm Richards asking me Dan I have an investment in income stocks I have a nice ah average yield\nUh butter small loss made me from to stocks I'm concerned about one of those stocks does it have a longtime term upside well\nIf you're concerned about it I Would sell it I'm not concerned but if you're concerned about it I Would sell it I it's an income stock if you have an income stock you're not supposed to be concerned about any income stocks you only concerned about the income that you're receiving\nAnd as long as you're getting income from it every thing on my list has been a long term upside as far as Oxford so I you know every thing on my list long term as an upside to it\nUm if it does and I'm probably going to put it on my cell list but um I Would not be concerned about that if you are truly an income investor if you are concerned about gross\nAnd your income investor then you're really not an income investor and probably shouldn't be an income investor probably ought to\nYou're then you're really not an income investor and probably shouldn't be an income investor probably ought to be thinking about some different kind of growth stocks so I don't know if that helps you are not Richard maybe it does [noise]\nUh let me go to sue sue is calling us from Texas to\nThe point and thank you for taking my call sure I I agree with you about it lately I disappointed and I'm going to face but I mean we have to remember that we pray for somebody that they were placing her that with any of the efforts also\nDue to a point in much better on the planet much better points that I made about any of that so yes a good point I appreciate your bringing it up because we she was such a strong person in that very important position\nWe need to pray that God raises up another person as strong as for sure good points thank you for sharing that\nAnd then you know it's getting so far for next appointment\nYes yeah yeah exactly 'cause I don't think she's going anywhere she's going to be in the\nIn the life for a while I Believe\nI I think it brings up a great many people they bring our country that are that we are saying\nNo doubt about it I'm with you on that suit God prescribing yep [laughter] I think you can I let\nMy husband and I are old self employed I'm an attorney think the real estate broker the company went one time we currently have three teenagers at home not wanting to say it on a pool or near Dallas that's the other two are in high school\nI mean they're not even paying for their college the system with everything they need to pay for college they get bored and they don't waste it so that that will sell for all of our other children as well right um but we had lost pretty happy over the last\nDecade on all things a lot of our our painting poor thing but we're we are right now we have to apartment building\nKept walkway awhile to hundred thousand dollars of equity I'm a little bit ... hundred thousand and it's a little bit more perhaps we're looking at selling those um\nAnd so and then we have about a hundred and thirty thousand dollar mortgage on our house we have no other that but we do not have the same thing go like why\nDidn't you know what we think is do we have plenty out of the apartment building and thirty one that into something out\nShould we pay our house and then start\nBuilding a bad fit me open Iraq's IRA you know what is a plan for it we can continue for war or a great long time but we are self employed and we all know often it but we want it to\nThat right so if you are getting your your obviously getting positive cash flow out of those apartment\nWe are but they are located in another state and about an hour one way drive so that was one of our thought what do we we\nAre a great state of high income taxes and high taxes will stay at that so now they are they are at the end up so that was one of his knee why we were thinking of selling them and then re purchasing closer to at least\nYou know so um I think that's a fine idea if you're okay having real estate [noise]\nUh I don't think you're going to do better from an income perspective and anything you do a\nBetter that's going to be better than the than the real estate\nAnd I think the idea of tend to you know I mean obviously I Would find it gets give some property lined up because you obviously understand the time limit there you have to get that reinvest it but I think that's a that's a great idea\nI I think that you know whether I don't know how much equity a you say you've got about two hundred thousand dollars in equity and you've got two hundred thousand or two thirty on your on your mortgage um I I mean from my perspective based on what you've said I probably would would I'm looking at\nUsing the equity to take care of your income needs for your retirement not necessarily to pay off the income or the mortgage now at some point in time when you do retire if you don't work if you stop working then there's always the question of it is you were\nYou know mortgage going to become burdensome uh to to pay for that every month and now the the positive cash flow that you have in this new real estate investment\nIs um you know going mostly to pay that mortgage since you don't have the income anymore and that's where you have to think about I Would probably take the approach that I Would\nI'm\nNot still still leave things the way they are if you work in another five years I Would wait you know that's going to you may be getting to the place in the mortgage where a lot more of your principal and maybe have opportunity with some of the new guys for [noise] slowly you generate to\nPay towards other principal\nAnd relieve some of the time you have left to pay that and I would rather see you do that and I think that makes much more sense so I Would do the ten cent or you want to change I Would get that done I think that makes good sense I Would do it sooner rather than later because I'm concerned about the ... the um\nYou know the the sale of the property you know I I don't know where it is but you do and it might be in a great area and you're not concerned about that but uh I Would do it sooner rather than later um get that sale and start reinvest\nA a man Dr one belt is one of the greatest speakers you'll ever here on how do we know God exists and how do we know that the Bible is really true and ran and I are going

can call in I can pursue it I I had this experience with my wife were shopping for an SUV first time I've always just driven a car\nAnd anyway shopping for an SUV and I am very rarely shop for cars because for much of my the last decades I have been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses in any way whatever it is it I'm now as we're having a new experience which I haven't had it in a while ago even car dealers and I don't want to give car dealers the business I Want to do with the Internet I Want to know what to do it with the you know with car dealers [noise]\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there were almost all young men with whom I took

didn't have an answer and they said with no embarrassment I'll look it up oh let me let me just looked at him\nSo I as I said at the end I think that if this is it all representative and it may not be like fully acknowledge that but if it is it all representative\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey I could look it up\nWhy why do I have to know if that is you can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the length of the of that SUV

right now they\nAre I Am so proud of them and uh we do have an office out in front of a ... because of all the gross out there um I Love driving out there for one I Love to go to the island when I Need to just a quick weekend I Love going out there 'cause I feel like a miles away\nBut my last tour over there when I took a drive I cannot believe all the construction going on all the growth\nAnd I know you had a lot to do with that um he went toe to toe with with a developer 'em and you saved your a community a lot of money I'm On taxes if I'm not mistaken once\nYou tell us a little bit about that\nWell I was the former mayor I mean the the struggle as a as a local official early is to keep\nKeep it nice of that to set of guidelines and uh uh\nTo to enforce the voting laws and to make sure it's a nice place up everybody wants to move in and build everything out but to keep it\nI guess I had a nice community burning the Nassau County I Know we talked about the uh the wild light a development which is gonna be a I think a big plus for all of northeast Florida\nAnd are currently Nassau County and wildlife officials are\nAre disagreeing on some things I'm working hard on bring them together I think there's going to be a happy ending down the down the road there's a couple of meetings coming up where I Believe both both sides will come together in a work things out to the benefit of the taxpayers as well as a future residents of northeast Florida\n[noise] and that if I'm not mistaken is I'm\nBringing a lot of new schools parks and um you're looking at probably twenty four thousand residence\nThis is over a long period of time um eleven million square feet of non residential use including office light a industrial and commercial but this is over a long many years\nIt's like a mini ... if you're familiar I mean if you had to be a city in itself there's already a school what's what's mind blowing about uh the wildlife development is they one of the first things that was built a is an elementary school wildlife elementary before the first house is out of the ground\nElementary before the first house is out of the ground the school is filled for six hundred kids stole my guys already full forward thinking yeah that's a\nReally you know strategy to get an immunity on your side\nRight as well and you didn't get a great job with that and I know it's ongoing struggle but um you seem to um to have done a great job and from what I understand they were trying to get out of pain but fifty million\nWell it's still it's really still a source of a debate\nOf the two sides of who's paying for for what I've helped Nassau County or the county commission or in a in trying to bring both sides to the table so it's ongoing as we speak right now but the next month or some key meetings I Believe both sides are getting them together and I\nI'm an optimist I expect a happy ending\nWell I tell ya if people are having a driven out there they really need to go up and take a look 'cause a lot is happening on Nassau County right now a lot of growth I Know we're happy about it\nOh yeah ... I remember a time before senator being before a representative being the former mayor the [laughter] it was a realtor being and I've\nTo ask you this question putting on your hindsight real estate professional ... Ninety nine thousand dollars or a cottage on the ocean front of a fern into you know if you've bumped it up a little bit a buck and a quarter were and ocean front home\nIn front of you know wouldn't our world be different ... up a few of those and made that recommendation to me yeah I'm Out there\nMy belly in the sand and Vernon Dana expecting houses and all\nYou had listings at a hundred grand on the ocean front and I got like nothing for ... I don't understand that\nWe were talking earlier about or just seeing prices seeing prices houses that are that I listed a long time ago houses that we've all lived in now and what they're selling for prices are just just a skyrocket\n... they ... I have a thousand dollar cottage on the ocean to ban is goes praised roughly ... ... and it truly was a a shack it would be nine hundred to a million dollars oh\nYeah that is tremendous the dirt alone huh there alone\nMy first house that I bought in uh in Ninety two I'm thirty eight thousand dollars and uh\nNever thought I Would live in it of course I got married I told my wife will never lived there and of course I carried or across the threshold that's our new house on you know we had to sell that when they get to the next one we have to sell out here and get to the next one and uh but\nThat first house at thirty thousand dollar house I think just sold for uh just under three ... three hundred two hundred and fifty I mean it just makes a good pretty amazing I have no part of it I'm just\nFor a guy who make six bucks an hour as a state senator and I guess we'll see you guys are generous [laughter] it's rapid\nFire here I I had no idea how I Am at me rapid fire that where the rock star or the way that we have a I have a question I was looking at some of your\nGoals and you have some um which we are going to talk a little bit about each of them but you're very interested in creating jobs that become careers or jobs in ... new businesses to the area explain how you plan on doing this [noise]\nWell it's creating programs I guess working with the schools and creating vocational ed programs in Nassau County we created a a a joint use the ... that's really doing well right now a joint used facility that are high school uses\nA and also a high school uses during the day but our Florida State colleges Jacksonville uses that night that teaches a variety of different skills and trade to ah\nTo kids and young adults ... so they can move forward with a with a job companies right now and while he knows his too we talked about it earlier they're looking for talent they're looking for people who can fill\nFill jobs in what's becoming scarce\nRight into the workforce development what some of the areas that you think of the companies that are either considering er here already need the most for someone interested in going back to school\nIt is literally all across the board and all across the board we did a bill this past year about I'm excited about really to help veterans okay that or if you've a been a plumber in the army for however long five years and years Twenty years uh\nYou you get out of the army should you have to start all over because the state of Florida doesn't recognize that you're uh have any skills\nIn plumbing and so we tried to fix that and took some steps to say state of Florida recognized experience in credentials from the military and variety of things whether it's fixing an air conditioning or bombing or ... or electric\nYeah always surprised when I first heard that was not the case you know because you know you're trained for areas and they're doing it to defend the country at the highest level of of skill and expertise but then when you go to civilian life none of that experience I guess up until this law was passed it was passed but we tried to do and I was really a\nGood that's fantastic that is awesome because my son is in the military so I'm excited about that [noise] stay with us and give us a call on I Know for tripled see you're taught that struggle to eight to five five [noise]\nAnd let's ask parent beans some hard questions [laughter]\nI'm excited to have you here Sarah [noise]\nGives us the Medicaid money that you're giving other states that would make a tremendous difference but do it in a way that brings free market forces to Florida where people get to uh use\nThat money to purchase their own policy rather than be put on a government type of program\nI think the market forces are a great way to make health care accessible and affordable\nThat bill passed the Florida Senate did not pass the or the Florida House but any way that we can use a consumer choice and competition those are the key things that are going to make a difference in Floridians access to health care\nThis past year a bill was passed\nTo allow doctors to\nHave a practice without getting certified by the insurance industry by the by\nThe a ... hour which is the uh which is a division of Florida that puts a lot of red tape on a doctor's practice well we have broken that free where a doctor can offer his his services or hair services for cash and we think that's going to again to bring competition and choice to the marketplace\nVery good that at that that answer your question\nReally guys thank you so much\nJane thanks for ah for illicit and Jane thank you and I enjoy your show\nThank you well that was the question\nWas you know ... one area where the\nThe actual ... customer very often had doesn't have any say on who they want to use you know that's determined often by big insurance carrier that's ... by the employer if we did a grocery shopping that way\nYou know if the only reason why we accept it you know imagine if you're you know well new order to buy groceries because of cost prohibited the nature of it you you have to go to where the employer decided you would be using and you can't go to public she got to go you know another one maybe all all do whatever they want us all to all these or whatever it might be\nGreat in your job would just be grateful that you got you know food coverage of as an employee benefits and um you know ... things that were the consumer can make choices themselves ethic that drives competition and makes it more affordable and then it also gives incentives to health care providers to be as innovative is they can to be better way to\nExactly especially like you said you know you are um you hold the children close to your heart and this here there's a lot of people that don't have and this gives them the opportunity of perhaps being able to afford to go in to get that to get checked\nOut we've got a challenge in our health system though in it at the uh analogy that I've given if I Know that Wylie is going to be paying for dinner when he takes me for dinner I'm going to order I Know he's not as much as I can but if I Know I'm going to pay for it then I'm going to be much more frugal\nAnd an inch and it wasn't as an insurance company paying more consumer doesn't isn't this cost conscious as they need to be as if it were their own their own money\nWe've got to figure out a way to harness that and that's why we want to bring free market and choice in to the to the marketplace a as a way of controlling cost\nI have a real quick as it relates to our money amendment one coming up to expand homestead exemption another twenty five thousand dollar exemption I understood that locally that impact could be as much as a loss of twenty eight million dollars\nHow what is the balance between not wanting to pay any more and the impact on services overall as we look locally and across the state if that amendment were to pass well\nThat is a great question real estate in Russia's any homeowner nose or how they value their homes that exemption if you talk to a\nIf you talk to somebody who thinks they paid too much in taxes they're going to say we do need an increase in our homestead exemption it's been many many years since it's increased as we've talked about real estate values have skyrocketed now\nOr if you talk to somebody and local government because the bulk of that money goes to a local government rice or they're going to say wait a minute this is this is our bread and butter money this is how we provide the\nServices are to them I've already voted for this in in the Florida Legislature I think it is time to have an additional a levee of protection for the homeowners in the state of Florida\nAre the latest polls show that's a that's an iffy if if the state of Florida is going to\nGo either way right now is it takes sixty percent of all the amendments sixty percent and uh right now there's lots of if he thinks of that that are out there to be settled from our governor to our cabinet races to the uh to be all the amendments that are out there as well which makes it exciting\nAt the bottom line though your vote counts and I know you're out of relentless Roger that dean talked about that every morning your vote counts who do it it truly does it does make a difference for a single one of them\nGive us a call at the triple to talk that struggle to eight to five five and we'll be right back on WB obey [noise]\nThere are some things you just

fail\nGeorge and one of the things that I'm ed is happening here in the governor's race and I've heard folks say that well that I'm a Mr Gillum is a a a socialist than I Do not believe that he is truly a socialist however he does is linked to lean toward the\nSome socialistic um um the the ideals and uh I don't believe we can can even start that road toward\nThose those things that he wants a sand and I'm In his campaign and his his campaign has there been very straightforward about telling you what do you use a intended showed so no one on this side of the um the fences is making up things to uh to uh\nPaint a Mr dealing with a with a bad rap and he has come right out and said I'm well one of the things is um he wants to legalize I'm I'm a recreational marijuana or went to\nThat one or just keep people spaced out like in California San Francisco so they do actually checking the details of what their elected officials are doing with their money\nAnd they ... they stay in a fog and I've been in a few countries are a few countries like that or whether it's just too much radiation from cell phones and the kids there's\nA smart meters which I'm finding that right now people are really upset and California about it are flat just lying to people and and making sure that the media does not cover\nWhat's really happening happening that Israel socialism and what Gillian Roth is just more and more power\nYes I'm like you George I'm I was in the navy for a number of years a little over twenty five years\nAnd I managed to um to make it one world cruise um those circle navigation of the uh uh the globe um and I can now I'm here to attest to the world is round it just not flat there somewhere we're trying to tell us [noise]\nAnd um I've got just gotten the opportunity to see how people live at street level I'm at a in different countries I'm In ... the\nPeople here in the United states have really never seen poverty\nI have I have seen poverty edits um edits absolute worst um I remember one time that uh uh we were talking with the um the military attache in one of the embassies that he had come aboard the ship and said you know what are you guys planning on doing well\nThe embassies that he had come aboard the ship and said you know what are you guys planning on doing well what we told him we had been out and in certain sections of the city and he says don't go there he says your life is not worth five cents and some of these places that if you've got a\nA gold wedding ring on or\nSort of wealth or you are an infinite target he says don't do it and\nI always end up with a shining path the socialist communism and likely that people walk up and they said ah we're we're we're not going to do this\nAnd then the Columbia with the FARC uh the communist and they were fighting with the drug cartels and the dark curtails for fighting with the with the ah the main government and they got kind of improve the country when we help them but the FARC still is in the government now\nAnd Mexico ah with with hit very hard in the twenties and thirties with people coming over from Russia\nOr to turn out the schools and the government and the media and to a communist state\nAnd they're still fighting fighting with that one uh Lewis and proving to to some degree and I just wish that every child could have the opportunity to spend two or three years and one of these countries and see how bad it is\nYes and in reality living there and [noise] and ah I just I have come to the collision that people just don't know and I when I walked door to door or a candidate for the most important questions I ask if what is it that you want\nWhat are your big issue and then you can go from there talking about why a conservative Republicans have a better way of dealing with the world than the socialist leading to communism lead into dictatorship\nOr George how how often do you have someone to tell you a question like that or I Would really rather prefer that I'm ... stayed out of my life\nWell actually I walked a lot of district Democrat ... it with was Republican and Ninety eight percent of the people there\nSaid they agreed with having a four one K. type system\nOr where they could have money to retire that they wanted the school system actually taught the kid something they could use 'em in in uh in life and work and they actually went down through a lot of things we promote but many of them are Democrats and they just really didn't understand\nHow their party was not moving towards the facts\nYes that would be my main goal I Would like to see less and less government all the time because the greater the government intrusion into all of our lives are I don't think is terribly beneficial now granted there must be regulations because there are\nActors on both sides that are that if you don't have some stronger regulations that points um they will they will try to um\nUh become [laughter] ... almost an an Amazon or a monopoly a monopoly if\nYou will you know they were all starting to understand government was the problem is I was talking to them and they didn't necessarily understand that when I started in ... I looked at the the Fox poll last night and they said number one is a health care health and health care and number two the the economy [noise]\nAnd um what we've seen to two groups pop up that would really caught medical care and a half and give us a better way of dealing with things one is\nAt the same day out in Wichita, Kansas and Sean Hannity who pushing they're there for years fifty dollars a an adult from a ... for the doctor can for children\nAnd then they cut their um make your medical in other words going to the hospital down and half down there by six thousand where people don't realize they and their ... their employer paying ... anywhere from ten to twelve\nAnd the other as a matter of share which you're sharing system for for a for Christians and it's on it's advertised on this station another station\nAnd when you go through and start telling them that you know the facts you start telling exact figure good grief I uh maybe I'll talk to my boss of out of\nA ... a ... than a I'm a ... it's it's amazing is that the folks want a lot of things and it's always available until the socialist run out of someone else's money\nYeah Margaret Thatcher said that she [laughter] socialism worked in Delhi runs out of other people's money does it produce and so you end up with the country bankrupt actually which is what is happening even for a while and\nThen the uh the government takes over and it becomes a dictatorship and they will tell you and they're in the last throws at that time of um of the the viability of the country it is it is starting to collapse on its own weight\nAnd um it really gets ugly after that started or inside thank you for calling in\nA and our next segment we'll talk about the ballot amendments and are those Republican candidates stay
