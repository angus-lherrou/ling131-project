deeply involved in traditional Marxist causes from my ratings everything they touch\nIs against the nation's identity there one world order new world order people those to having a son so don't confuse the two and here's the problem missed the shift by muted by merging\nThey're radical politics with the ...\nThey're radical politics with the legit\nReligious affiliation what you're doing is smearing the religion itself and making the the larger population come to believe that all Jews are radical leftists which is where the problem begins at I Want to go into that today certainly not in this in this moment\nBecause as I was reading about the Nazi who did this this cowardly not seek to defense will develop and ... developmentally disabled brothers or this or their seventies and eighties some Ninety this was a cowardly act there was no heroism here\nI was thinking about this how did he know that of all places ... how did he shows this reformed temple in Pittsburgh as his

on television and settled back and keep your jokes to yourself\nIf you were to analyze what triggered this guy you know you could say I was just crazy it's crazy he's also a cowardly the killer\nBut there's always a reason inside a crazy person's head I don't know if you understand that [noise]\nIf you study FBI profiling they will always show you that even a crazy person in their own mind as a reason for what they do I don't know if you understand that you have to undo maybe you've seen enough movies to even understand that that fundamental thought to even I met a person\nWould that committed an act of violence senseless violence\nIn their own mind\nThey have a justification for what they are doing\nShould this lunatics that I'm going in after we saw the ... coming in on the southern border now you say what's the connection if you can't see the connection I can help you if you want us to sit here skating around the truth is that I've been trying to warn you about I Can't help you\nI told you on friday I warned you after the impotent bomber was caught\nDo you remember what my words were on friday do you remember how I tried to warn you that there are likely tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of heavily armed trained people in this country or the breaking point and if you keep spending on them calling them white trash\nTalking about them like their garbage in non humans dismissing them as though they don't matter\nYour going to see things happen in this country that are going to make that input in bomber that steroid not look like what he was a clown and I wake up Saturday morning and I say oh my God\nOh my God look what just happened and who triggered this guy\nNow don't confuse my analysis of this cowardly madman for any sort of justification or apologies for him because I'm not offering that\nAt all but of course the vermin in the Twitter world will immediately tried to make that happen I've got one of them now from Miami, Florida who the FBI is tracking because their rhetoric is escalating you'll have no idea what it's like to be in the public eye today\nUnless you're in it [noise] it's very easy to sit in your house and listen to me or listen to someone else and have your own opinion and God Bless you for listening to the show but when you were on the front lines in the nation right now\nYou don't know what hatred is out there like I Do and the range mentality of these liberal progressive so it's something\nTo behold [noise]\nJoy the Savage Nation cold feet by ... four hundred and Seventy five a four hundred and seven to eight to [noise]\n\nFor many years I've been wanting to Savage Nation about a secret war on cash by big government and big tech to steal both your money and your privacy well recent reports confirm that this war is expanding like wildfire and time is running out to take action would you please not become the next victim in this battle\nPlease discover how to win the war to destroy your harder and savings\nMy good friends that switched America have detailed all the dirty little government secrets and there are updated report\nBut it's free it's called the secret war on cash\nPart too it's available now by calling the eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six but it's important to report the secret war on cash this documents real life events such as banks refusing to cash checks cash being confiscated from innocent citizens\nThe Israelis know 'em right\nMany many people have known I'm right with the churches in America many churches and are protected by armed guards but to a progressive the idea of using a policeman\nAn off duty policeman or an armed guard is such anathema they would rather see people defenseless them protected biggest they don't want to be seen as politically on the side of those of us who understand the power of protection of guns afford a ... show nuts\nSo those of us who understand the power of protection of guns afford a show none other than the lunatic of lunatics to blast ... in New York has the nerve to say no guns in needed listen to clip six and you'll hear the mind of a madman\nYou only have never allow the normalization of hate that's not what we will stand for and in that vein we have to say what was said yesterday I was also unacceptable no houses of worship do not have to have armed guards to be able to practice their religion that's not America\nYou know you are really stupid I'm coming to understand that there's actually no logical reason in the minds of a liberal waters normalization of hate have to do with protecting yourself in a synagogue or a church there is no connection between the two\nAnd I will say again there's only one solution to this protect yourself at all times because no one else will be that protects you\nKnow we can stance forward because I'm not ready to move up there yet I got too many hours to go you have to move up to it but at the end of this terrible tragedy where this this ah Nazis psychotic\nKilled on on defense was Jews who had nowhere to defend themselves it was the the police with guns Mr ... who went in and stop them it wasn't you with your mouse\nIt was cops with guns some of whom got shot shame on you to blast geo shame on you for the basing the police for doing this incredible job\nThey were the ones who tracked him to a little room where he was hiding and they were the ones who got this cowardly psychotic to throw as weapons now he's in a hospital somewhere being cared for don't you just love that\nLike the terrorists we've seen America after they kill people they're treated better than the people they shot what a wonderful country we live in but nevertheless I'm just a talk show host you're observing\nAnd trying to help you get through this day I Know many of you were waiting for my opinion I understand that I have a very loyal audience\nWho appreciates my view of things and so far I've given you several views of these things in one way or another but I'm not yet gotten to inside the mind of a psychopath\nI've also challenged you by saying do you believe that I'm correct that we need armed guards in houses of worship I mean it just such an obvious answer to the question what is the Blasio talking about what do you mean who's normalizing hate\nWas saying protect the people\nPut a policeman in engine that what we do with schools now remember what happened in Florida with that cowardly cop who hid behind those pillars remember him he was actually in the school to protect the children when that guy came up with a gun was hiding behind the pillows he's collecting a bench and now\nThe cop should be a president who ran away these cop should be invited to the White House which they will be\nOne of them are still in the hospital because he took bullet wounds in the hands thank God none of them were killed but some of them was severely injured because unlike the blast year they knew they knew that one thing guns save lives guns save lives guns save lives\nIt's a great group called juice for the protection of firearms ownership they know all about this\nAnd so I Want to play for you this sounds at this moment of the scanner audio at the end of this is the one at the end I don't want the one of the beginning we have the scanner audio the cops going in police played that one listen to this\n[noise]\n\n\n\nFor [laughter] for [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd they are the clock clock [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nWell that's the police scanner as they went in to take down the Nazi or after he killed all those innocent people but as you could see they went in with guns drawn\nNot with the white flag they weren't waving the French flag when they went in these are heavily armed ... highly trained extremely brave men who went in there it wasn't a bunch of liberals going in waving Mr Roger's neighborhood in book form\nAnd asking him to please join them for a a a a a snack they were ready to shoot and they got shot some of them guns can save lives\nAnd in New York by the way or the NYPD was sent to protect mosques I don't know if you know that the same ... Hussein guns and never the answer\nWe don't have to have armed guards to practice their religion why did he sent the armed guards to mosques anyone have an answer to that because he's a liar hypocrite period he's a ... he's a bombings a mutt\nEnjoy those Savage Nation coal no eight by four hundred and Seventy eight by bugs for number seven to eight to some of\nThe Savage Nation is sponsored by switched America the only company I trust with my financial future coal eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or switched America dot com here's the truth about most home security companies well they're like dealing with another bad you know old fashioned cable company\nYou're going to spend hours waiting around for technicians hours on the phone to get questions answered and then when that you're a breaking point you remember I'm locked in a three year contract with these people that look if you look at a protect your home go with simply safe home security why\nSimply safe is real comprehensive protection beautifully designed looks good on your home using it makes your home is actually much safer\nThe protection beautifully designed looks good on your home using it makes your home is actually much safer simply say patch back up some place to keep you safe protecting your home even if you lose power into that or some of the tax system best of all you get twenty four seven monitoring with police and fire dispatch\nFor just Fifteen dollars a month and unlike other\nSimply safe has no long term contract it's the best around the clock protection you could find it the best price get free shipping and free returns at simply safes average dot com now go to simply safes average dot com\nHello I'm Ted Yoho and I'm your congressman Florida's third congressional district I'm asking for your support and your vote in this upcoming November ... election let me tell you why in the past two years we've cut taxes in reduced regulations creating the best academy in decades today we have the lowest unemployment\nIn recent history across tall demographic a stronger economy means a stronger job market and that means higher wages increased benefits and better opportunity more importantly we're improving education for all of our children\nWhether it's in medicine high tax them in the arts for high paying trade jobs were making sure that every child is educated today for the jobs of tomorrow\nWe want to make sure our schools are safe so children can learn free of fear [noise] that's why we provided funding for mental health counseling and enhanced security on campuses across or district now is the time to continue this focus on growing our economy helping our children achieve their fullest potential let's keep the future bright visit\nTed Yoho dot com and please vote on November six I'm Ted Yoho and I approve this message [noise]\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and one ... gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to net is share for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month\nIn the global investment management businesses retention financial they\nLearned more in the G.

most people fear guns I've seen this my whole life I've heard people say I don't want a gun in my house and the answer is why well they're afraid they'll use it on themselves or they'll use it against the spouse in a moment of rage\nAnd then there are those of us who understand the difference between fear and reality and we understand that we have to protect ourselves in a society where you have to have a policeman in in every home\nSo we come back to the questions of the day which is should armed guards be placed in houses of worship absolutely no question about it just as we came to that conclusion with the school shootings were common sense would dictate that of course most schools have\nArmed guards around them but not to the progress of the regrets that line is so blind to reality

you want me to make the connections\nBetween the bogeyman of America today the one that you're allowed to voice contempt for the white nationalist\nI Will do so I'll be glad to do it for you\nBecause there have always been white nationalist in this country many of them died in World War two\nOh yes they mean a lot of white nationalist in America look at some of the revolutionary war cemeteries Oh yes they've been a lot of white nationalist intimate in America\nLook at all of the um military cemeteries around America will see an awful lot of white nationalist who went to die ... fight and die for their country\nBut all of a sudden the word and white in national it's been linked together by the radical left into one phrase that signifies something other than being Caucasian hula a Caucasian loves his nation suddenly it means something akin to not see us him\nAnd this is a trick of the radical left in America they've tripped many people don't even know what they're talking about the things that if you are of a Caucasian background and you're a nationalist you're a Nazi\nIn a necessarily so [noise] so therefore we have to look into the mind of the white nationalist especially the

meetings so [noise]\nUm anyway good food man good food good people little hot but aside from that it doesn't get any better so we we uh love mobile or glad or a year and we hope you'll come out to see us tonight we're going to be at the Mariette on airport boulevard\nA tonight at six thirty come out early like the meat as many of you as I possibly can to try to do that we'll get started I Want to hear from you and I think a lot of questions I Want to hear about what you're thinking about the economy or you're thinking about the elections how that's going to impact your ability to be a good steward or not we want to hear about those things\nUm will give you a little bit of a recap of ah where where we think things are headed and we'll we'll go from there right now all the industry still are you know they really haven't I Wonder what the volume is I have not checked and I should check it at the last week [noise]\nBut I Wonder where the volume is right now I'm because\nThis is this is what we like to see you know if you start to feel good when you get you we've got some great economic numbers we got a pending home sales are going up I'm almost every one percent uh that's pretty good because it's been four straight months of losing streaks\nOn pending sales a very good number so we're really excited about that we got a very good ... good numbers durable goods very important number ... and I'm I'm kinda surprised because new home sales were down some kind of surprised by this number\n... it was what I was hoping for but I'm surprised so we got a better half of one percent increase in durable goods\nDurable goods or were expected to be a negative a number of one point five percent\nSo that was a mess in the right direction\nAnd that's very good to hear so consumer still extremely confident uh and durable goods one of the things that I'm concerned about that could put a stop to all of this confidence is if a gasoline prices continue to rise and and you know that's something that we have\nTo be a can concern about\nA particularly as we look at what what's happening to oil prices but they have been coming\nDown oil prices have been coming down\nAnd continue to come down and uh hopefully a gasoline prices are coming down so we're at a two eighty where at two dollars and eighty four cents nationally it was to two dollars in eighty seven cents on Monday last week\nIt was two dollars in eighty seven cents\nWeek so we're about uh where we were were lower than we were last week's slightly show\n'em good news or we go back a month or two eighty five would go back a year ago we are to forty five so when you love to see two dollars or forty five cents\nFor gasoline again that would be wonderful I Love to get back to a year ago because a year ago diesel fuel was two dollars and Seventy three cents and right now ... three dollars and twenty nine cents\nSo uh this is going to be great gasoline prices moving in the right direction along with a crude oil crude oil is saying\nYou know up where it needs to be for stock prices it's holding this Seventy six I'm Sorry sixty seven a dollar a barrel\nSo that's that's good I I you know if we continue on this trajectory we're going to be by the middle of next month a Thanksgiving\nAnd you're going to roll those over to gather all in one place in your new i._r._a. account that's where it's all going to go\nThey say fit\nAnd because I had to send it his death it get in get out and make out\nOkay now is are all the accounts in one place\nYou know that they're they're not want to like [noise]\nOkay [noise] so at some point in time there is no hurry there's no sense of urgency\nBut I but put them all in one just so you know where everything is and you're only getting one statement every month they don't make it easier for you so if you if they move I think you said they moved to fidelity maybe\nYeah or something where [noise] okay\nSo that would be a great one to just put it all into that\nBut here's the thing and after you do that it's going to be easy because they're already in your name so it's going to be real easy to do\nThe fidelity people without account ... people will will give you a transfer for them to sign it's not hard to do do take care of it you won't have to do anything just have to sign the transfer for on those other camps that aren't in there and just let it all go in there\nIt's when it comes in it goes into just a money market account just earning a little bit of interest don't turn anything for a year\nFor I don't want you to invest it I don't want you to think about it you're going to have people that are going to call you\nOwe the animal in Congress say\nOh I Know they have and they're going to keep going you you're not don't do anything don't do anything just get the accounts during your name [noise] even if you don't move 'em that's okay but don't do any investing just leave everything alone\nAnd then a year from now or so\nUh when when things settled down you've got so many changes to go through I'm so sorry to hear about your loss\nAnd there's so many there's so much emotion that we you know that we all have one we have\nA loss like that and I you you're not in a place not you but nobody is in a place to make any decisions or to talk to anybody as far as I'm concerned about anything for the next year\nSo I Want you to relax [noise] nothing can go wrong or happen with that money nothing just let it sit it transferred and sit and probably in a money market account most of it [noise]\nJust let it sit there don't worry about it when the statements come you don't even have to open them throw him in a file don't even don't even open it doesn't matter it's all irrelevant it doesn't matter what happens ah just forget about it for twelve months and then\nA year from now call me back\nAnd ... we'll talk through some options and some things you might want to think about it [noise]\nBut don't don't talk to anybody a at all or do you do you get a cold well it's really important to you do it now because the markets don't know nothing's nothing's important they have to do anything now so don't even worry about it just relax\nAnd a move on there so many other things far more important that you can be praying through in working out\nIn the next twelve months and this is in one of them so don't even worry about it so that's what I Want you to do and I think that all serve you really well later on\nOkay I'm Out that one more question Bob Hope and believe that\nAnything that has a\nLot of cat and then he said recently started working with me with a team and they are getting paid ... what do I what I mean I Can't the positive at all or\nNothing or or do I do know don't don't do anything with it\nEven worry about it and I'm going to throw it in the same category don't even worry about it don't do anything don't don't take a look at it won't do anything I mean that it doesn't matter I I just\nI don't want to get even give you any ideas because I don't want you to be I I just you don't need to even be thinking about it so it's not nothing's happening yeah I I'm going to I'm going to have some things that I'm going to want you to do a year from now or so but it's okay don't worry about it\nUm you know in another year we ... we got to look at everything that you have it\nUm you know in another year we get we get a look at everything that you have\nAnd see if it works obviously if you need some of that to fix something or by some huge you know use it for that but uh don't don't worry about where it is or what it's not doing or what it is doing just just leave that alone is well\nOkay um [noise] we were\nWere too young to I mean we were were ... we were both fifty three do it you know and I I don't mean anything because he was the kind of person that if you wanted something we have bought and bought it All right so there's no credit card debt before that I just ah\n[noise] I I'm Sorry I didn't feel but well I'm just you know a part of the earth but well\nYeah well you never have to be sorry for that and you certainly don't have to be ... sorry for being overwhelm you should be overwhelmed it's just a natural thing and you you would be I'm just trying to take one little element away it's not going to keep you from being totally\nA overwhelmed by so many other things but right now it's not something that should even be in your on your list of things to be thinking about\n... I definitely appreciate I listen to you every morning and I definitely appreciate all that you may\nEnd up they don't know if the if I keep a cop out the work but I mean but he never even heard of you know I Know yeah well even my number because\nThat unless it in it but yeah so many uh and that their company called ... and ... and you're right you're definitely right they call I mean all out of it\nUp so much they have any questions tell them to call me and my phone number here the car to the show say you know I I I'd love to talk to just to get them just to get them off your back say call this guy here's a phone number I mean they're not going to call but um and yeah don't don't even worry about it you're you're in great shape\nOr your husband or was was very wise in very prudent and the way he did things I Wish more people\nAre operated like like key uh obviously did and a what a blessing that's going to be to you later later in in life but um [noise] just just ah don't worry about anything and just forget about it and we'll talk again a year from now you keep listening\nOkay All right well thank you and keep keep me go ahead\nOh I Will I Will okay I promise I Will okay all righty and God Bless you You're welcome\nAnd folks we all need to be praying for and you ... you know and I hope that you will I Hope that that all the listeners will think about ants un I lift a two or tomorrow morning this morning when you and your prayer time lifting enough to you that that God would hold her firmly in it in his grip\nAnd that um she would she would find that to strengthen the courage or in the peace of mind to not be overwhelmed and it's such a difficult thing let me go to Roy Roy calling us from Texas hey Roy\nAnd then I have two questions\nRegarding Roth our age and I'll be as brief as possible by a okay automated farmer's son and Arkansas that a little farm worked on jobs for eight years it didn't work out to be that banks profitable for him now his wall\nAnd I'd like to take the proceeds from the sale of that farm and try to get her off our our array for him but he's got no income\nUh other than our show and I don't know what the eligibility standard is a new not know the amount of money that I can contribute towards them\nOr to or Jews or off for a year to if you can help me with those questions appreciated\nSure so here's the thing Roy he can't put more if he's under fifty I assume he is he's under fifty he can't put more than five thousand five hundred dollars fifty five hundred dollars in a Roth by\nIn order to open a Roth and contribute to her off you have to have earned income\nSo I'm his odd jobs and those kinds of things qualify for some earned income\nSo they would be okay on the ... list um you know by um don't buy anything off abroad less despite I'm also buy less [noise]\nAnd then they blew highlighted ones on the by list as well in you know there's some in energy they prefer utility companies\nUm utilities is a one sector right now that's held up really well through all this [noise] um so uh yeah I mean I Would I Would try to focus more on the blue highlighted ones and I just say to you there are so\nMore on the blue highlighted ones and I just say to you there are some that are paying six percent income\nYou'll you'll see and I might only have um listed as growth in income there's a couple that I only have listed as grows because I don't feel confident enough\nThat the income is going to be sustainable not not because the stocks bad but sustainable because of the company doesn't have a long track record of pain pain that kind of did a day and and I and I don't feel confident enough\nTo make it up purely an income stock or because I think you could start to see the income diminish\nAh as they constantly are lower or that the dividend so that's why some of those aren't highlight it but it for the short term they're fine but I Would try to stick to ah the the ... and the utilities I have a couple reached real estate investment trust\nAre that are on a by less right now that are that are good income stocks and they're the ones that I'd be focusing to wean and all but if you want to you as you get into consumer staples\nAnd the industrial ... you know look for I think that that you you said look for you know the growth in income so that you're always getting some income and sometimes those grows an income the incomes you know two and a half three percent I mean it's still decent\nUh but I'm just just not as a and they are consistent they're just not as high as some of the purely income stocks\nOkay so look for growth in income or that explains it and again God Bless you up really appreciate what you do\nThank you John appreciate your saying that senators rent or aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three aid for for seven o seven fifty five thirty three if you want it to your car oh You're welcome to do it let me go to John John's calling us from Texas said John\nGood morning Dan good morning\nI wanted to um get in some health care stocks for my portfolio I have done and I need a to get to the percentage promote asset allocation model that you have\nYou have to on your list and um they're eight seed twenty four nights she twenty nine\nAnd I was wondering if I should just split between the two and make a two purchases I had been tracking with one you used to have on your list recently agency forty one and I know the rule is if it's not on the ballot stumped by\nBut a ...\nUm no I wouldn't I wouldn't split the whole sector\nBetween those two stocks\nRather see you let I how much what the percentage the you're the you're trying to get what do you should have in that sector ... percent [noise] okay so I Would look at may be\nPutting three percent in that in those two stocks okay\nAnd and then just wait you know something will come along here ah and then you know try to add maybe two more um with that other two percent so I I'd rather you not put it just the whole five percent with those two\nOkay All right but definitely but definitely take a position you know and healthcare why why you can yeah\nWhat a what a good restaurant you're going to eat

five thirty three so give us a call if you've got a question\nIf you've got a concern I Know you've got a concern if you don't have a concern that I'm concerned I'm sure a lot of people have concern right now as we watch what is going on here on this October twenty\nThird October has not been a good ... ah just say the least it is a falling right in line for typical October's it seems so I'm not not a lot of good news coming out of this this month\nIf you want a fun exercise well maybe not fun but it might give you some comfort go back and look at the last\nFifteen October's and then look at the last Fifteen November and December is following those bad October that might make you feel a little better\nLook we're having a market sell off no doubt about it it's about earnings it's about industries are industrial ... the you know the cat doors as the three am of the world and so on and so forth um\nIt's about the Federal Reserve and it's about trade that is what it's about all these things have been with us by\nSeems to be getting ratcheted up why because it's been a long time remember last week or a couple of weeks ago I said that first quarter ...\nOh I remember last week or a couple of weeks ago I said that first quarter next year earnings are going to be bad as a result of trade\nTensions between the U.S and China I don't really comprehend how this\nCourt is the third quarter earnings can be impacted by that\nI find it extremely hard to believe as a matter of fact I Would be in almost total denial that it's had a dramatic impact\nWhy because it has it what happened and take caterpillar for instance\nIs is there are saying that the role materials are going up there for their guidance I hate guidance but their guidance for next quarter going to be bad or on the next quarter after that two thousand team guidance is getting worse everybody's reacting to that\nWell maybe it well maybe it won't ... but that's based on some political assumptions\nSo we're gonna have to wait and see\nSo that's that's what's impacting it's not that great now that the the liberal politicians as of this morning\nFrom now until the end of the election are all going to be talking about oh look at what President Trump has done because up trade and tariffs because of China us relations\nWith trade that would be wrong now if ... if the first quarter next year they want to say that go for it if we still have not worked at a deal\nThere is a strong possibility no I Would say there is a likelihood that\n... is this is the F F\nDemocrats take control of the house then we've got issues in some problems if it happens now [noise] [noise]\nRight now are you know if you want to be just right down the middle\nWhich means you're giving up your current income stream and once you give up that income stream the ideal situation is to have\nA really nice adequate emergency savings set aside and some other just you know normal everyday kinds of things savings are checking account set up because um you want to commit all of your\nIncome that is now a fixed income and the sense that you know it you're you're on a fixed income you know you have you got a pension you got a four one K. you got Social Security or whatever you have there you know what that is and so it all it all comes to\nUh you don't want to use some of that income to put aside in in\nEmergency savings you weren't already have that\nSo uh I Would say if you have been relatively new home you don't feel like you feel like most of the maintenance or things that can happen you're going to do out of your regular\nYou know just your normal income stream\nFrom on a regular basis you don't have any debt you know certainly you want to have a ten thousand dollar you know emergency savings account eight to ten thousand dollars but I Would say as you get closer to that retirement and you're now you're you know two years away from retirement you want to have that build up a little bit more\n[noise] um\nYeah no I agree [laughter] that that not because I got it from like a working for a long time ago like okay I'm On the market in the ... the six month expenses what every year and I just didn't know if\nI guess I heard your last Frank I'm somebody asked about how much money do you eat you know have it or you can retire at you had let them know that you should be able to plan on a five or six percent\nReturn so I get as far as like OK shooting or an income stream to be able to let on right but then I was just wondering okay like in addition to that you you know how\nHow much maybe as a percentage or I guess there's not that doesn't really work but\nWell I I mean remember ten years ago Fifteen Years ago\nI Would have been worried not not I mean if you were Fifteen Years younger I'd be worried about I'd ask you things like what kinds of jobs do you do you feel secure in their jobs have seniority\nIf the downturn in the economy would you likely get laid off because you're in the construction industry or would you be fine because you work for the local government or you're a teacher you know cry so I Would look at those things are critically important when you think because if I lose my job do I have enough income to carry me Carrie\nI lose my job do I have enough income to carry me carrying my expenses\nFor six months so very different situation I'm not as concerned about that for two reasons one is your little closer to retirement a you're a little bit older I Hope you have some you know real sense of the security on your job and the other thing is we live in an environment right now\nWhere are the threat of you know lay offs and losing a job um aren't as\nBig a deal say they would have been seven or eight years ago so I think I think the important issue is to take care of those emergency expenses that you don't want to get in debt to fix so\nWell I have a credit card if my furnace blows up I use credit card well yeah but now you got the debt and you've got to ... dead for ... years\nSo that's not a good strategy a better strategy is my furnace blows up I've got savings that I can replace it with so or ... or maybe you have income that you can use you know but so I Would just keep it isolated to those things and everybody is it a little bit of a different situation and that\nThat ... area that's why I hate to say you ought to have five percent of your income or ten percent of your income or you know one third of your annual gross salary you know committed to a um urgency savings because it may not\nIt may not be the case said it all you know I had so\nI Would just try to work backwards towards some worst case scenarios of what would happen right now and do I have emergency savings to take care of that so I don't have to get that\nOkay [noise] okay thank you very much\nAll right Bonnie I'm Glad you called I sure do appreciate thank you for your partnership\nThat's great I sure appreciate it\nLet me go to Stan Stan also calling it a ... state also calling us from Ohio a stand\nAlone to an ... good morning here last year saying by speaking the gospel trained for financial aid industry\nHad a question about [noise]\nSpecific stock in reference or not a teacher and coach and their finances stabbed rushing retirement age and leaving it legacy\nOr the next generation licensed broker\nA stir right right\nI was wondering what the [noise] someone saying lost money because they're not a a light switch stock sales personally yes why handle that\nFinancial liability in my scenario minister\n[noise] well I don't think you really have a liability their um the liability comes when you're charge enough see\nThat's when you have a liability so if you charge somebody if somebody says you know a pastor I was thinking about investing money can you help me\nAnd you said you know what for you know I for sixty five dollars an hour you know I'm I'm you know I'd be happy to help you then you got a liability um [noise] so I wouldn't be too concerned about liability\nBut even me one of the things that I Want to do more than anything else and it may be easier in the environment in which you're working for you to do this\nBut my our goal should be you and I stand our goal should be that the people that are in front of us that we want to convict them\nTo bring Jesus into their money\nWe want to convict them that as they would try to walk closer in their day to day world activities with Jesus that they would not separate\nAnd compartmentalize their finances\nThat that that too would be a part of their walk and face\nAnd we want to convince them of that we want to share the versus you know you hear me say that God says\nAh for those who honor me so I see on or not he says that in in first Samuel chapter two at the end of chapter two in you and and then you kinda have to read that whole chapter to to get a feel for that promise\nNow I don't know I thought what an honor looks like and I don't think we should be promising prosperity but I Do believe we can say you get a sense of peace\nUm uh by knowing that you're not grieving the heart of God with\nHow you're investing your money and it's important that we pray about how we should do that where we should go and some ideas this is you speaking out some ideas would be look from what I understand there are\nThere's really only one mutual fund company that you can diversify your portfolio\nAnd diversification is important so you're on a call this Timothy planned group and talk to them where you can fully diversify your portfolio there are a couple other bid look me responsible funds you heard me maybe yesterday recommend a a um\nInflation protected bond fund for somebody that was a specifically responsible to vanguard fund typically responsible most\nGovernment bond funds are typically responsible so there are some other alternatives but you know or use some of the ... you know I I Believe in things if you want to want to do that but you know the ... of the key is your job is to convict them do want to do that\nTo to want to make sure\nThat they're not investing in a company that are supporting abortion and pornography gambling and the redefinition it was funny I I Know in his shoe I'm I'm a mutual fund company that holds themselves out as being biblical responsible\nSomebody this morning a friend of mine sent me an article with a picture of this company set up at the uh L. T. G. beach convention\nUm you know I'm a ... with a booze trying to you know bring 'em the their their marriage uh\nReally important um looked\nAt the the other thing is a ... you mentioned about rationing\nAlready going on 'em and\nMedicare Advantage is taking advantage of rationing to the to to our seniors tell us about that\n[noise] yeah so just to be clear there is something that that government calls original Medicare and and there is Medicare Advantage the original Medicare is what happened in Nineteen sixty five [noise] and it means that you can go anywhere in the hospital any doctor um it it doesn't matter you can be seen anywhere and Medicare takes a ...\nIs as part of that and you you just you know\nA summit the bills to Medicare or the your doctor that through your hospital that but then there's Medicare Advantage which is part of which came up and a two thousand three and this is the HMO or the health plan version of Medicare and what this means is that the health plans to help lead by law are\nAllowed to say to deny you access to care now book Medicare's do deny access to care but the health plans to do it sort of at an arm's length\nDistance from Congress and this is Congress has clan that\nThey would be able to blame the health plans for asking your care once once you got into them so about thirty percent of the Medicare population is in the health plan it limits their access to care by limiting it to a network\nBy limit it to a medically necessary procedures as determined by the health plan um\nBy reducing what they pay to doctors and and the interesting thing is that the U.S department of health and Human Services the office of inspector general came out with a report that said this is so interesting\nThat said that of all the people who shoot and it's both people and practitioners who choose to appeal that denial decisions of health plan Seventy five percent of the time the health plans were versus their decision and move forward to pay for or authorize the care\nBut nobody appeals but only one percent from ... you know probably a vested died appeals and and why is that because\nIt is so difficult to do it because you know their ration health care can happen in many ways including putting bureaucratic\nI'm I'm barriers between the patient and the and the care or between the doctor and payment for their care and so and so you know this is all medically necessary care and the federal government is saying there's probably a lot\nMedically necessary care that's being denied by virtue of the fact that most people aren't appealing but when they appeal most people actually get the care so this is Jeff and that can hit them for asking Ken this is why\nWe tell people to go into original Medicare which which can also ration care is true but at least it's being done in a more accountable manner I connected to\nA Congress and um and it's not the health plan making little ... of money off of you and the taxpayer and I think this is one thing I should add as well so people understand these health plan\nThese plants are not insurance and they're not private market is this public private partnership between the government and these um plans which are really centralized corporate entities that are acting like socialized medicine but in a corporate fashion and I'm here's here's what's so interesting about the money that they're making\nSo somebody you probably have money in and and um you know what in plans in stocks right but but look at this um they are planning for there to be\nNot just Medicare for all the investors in this world think it won't be just a single payer system they're not worried because they're thinking that won't be Medicare for all it will be Medicare Advantage for all in other words it will be HMO run in this country single parent will be HMO health plan\nRun in this country and right now the health plans are making you know like bandits I'm One that does Medicaid only has had a rise in stock prices by four\nThousand percent since two thousand nine United Health group has gone up fourteen hundred percent\nAnd so they're just refinance money hand over fist all because of the Affordable CARE Act and because of Medicare Advantage\nNot ventured they're getting subsidized from ... to be in the Affordable CARE Act which as ludicrous\nIn many ways it's different ways of subsidizing them\n... you know it's just amazing and so if you were in this open enrollment period now folks for for Medicare\nYou really need to examine all of a but stick to the original medical Medicare if you can do that and um maybe you use some air to ministries or\nAs a as a supplement\nI'd also just like a safe for those who have bought the book there is a separate chapter in there about a Medicare Advantage and the accountable care organizations that people in the original Medicare are being forced into in secret\n... if you if you look at those scales section and see what Medicare is doing\nGreat [noise]\nTaught about as great a great stuff we sure appreciated as always [noise] why was the best [noise] nobody knows more about this is why\nI Choose your every month she

Obama criticized President Trump's tenure during a fiery speech and Milwaukee that took aim at him and other Republicans quote this is terrible unquote\nHere's a nother story now the ... the actress who played Megan Kelly\nI'm more of a ... girl so ... this lady played Megan Kelly in a video on a Brittany spears video from ten years ago\nAnd it's a headline that\nShe likes Rachel Maddow MSNBC host may Rachel Maddow better what I mean\nSo she played a conservative or a at a at a music video from a long time ago and it's a headline that she likes a liberal better even though she was like making fun of the conservative in the video anyway okay\nI mean you know I Will just waste everyone's time I guess I mean is that they weren't going to look at this and go oh my God it's that lady I don't know from that video I barely remember um I I guess I should vote for the Democrats\nTo maybe this is making headlines because the the lady played Megan Kelly like ten years ago and\nBecause of Megan Kelly getting fired recently maybe that's the reason why it's a it's a big deal may they went to that lady and um\nAnd by the way she was in that video so I watched the ... it's using them for like a second it's [laughter] it wasn't even worth looking at the video so she\nUm so Megan Kelly is out okay so NBC got rid of vegan Kelly [noise] because Megan Kelly said that on Halloween\nWhat she was a kid that you were allowed to dress up as as who you want so like if there was a black character it was okay for you to paint your face black and pretend that you were that black character for Halloween\nIt's black and pretend that you were that black character for Halloween\nI'm well apparently this is a very controversial because I Know that blackface is not\nAllowed I mean socially because you're making fun of of blacks and you shouldn't do that\nBut I feel like Megan Kelly was saying that it was okay to dress up as a black character I don't think Megan Kelly I mean I listen to the comments\nI don't I don't think although they're really hard to find right now I mean if you go onto um any kind of social media it's hard to find the original comments that got made so everyone's making it sound like Megan Kelly said that black faces okay which she explicitly said it wasn't [laughter]\nBut it doesn't matter you know I mean it just you conflate any ideas together um you know as Jon Stewart ah stated a long time ago nuances not important although he said nuances and important to the right\nOr really just new wants is an important to anybody and uh who cares what she actually said who cares what she meant\nUm ... she gets on TV and she apologizes\nAnd so and then and now she's done so they kicked her out anyway right\nUm I don't know\nI mean the midterms if if you're ever going to not do anything controversial it's going to be around midterms right so why would why would million tell even make a statement like that I don't know\nHead of the ... the heads of the news organizations now certain you know editors and people will still run their own stories\nSo I'm not saying it's not going to make any air time at all here is a politics editor Jason Johnson he's on MSNBC and this is his take on it I'm ... and apparently he's maybe shifting the blame a bit\nTo Donald Trump\nOur lives as much as I may have criticisms of how law enforcement operation of the country they are still our line of defense against maniac them terrorists out there but I I have to say nickel and this has always been a problem with the president has always shown a sympathy or a dismissive towards terrorism or he is a ... a terrorist sympathizers\nRight because if there's anyone known for probably around with terrorists as Donald Trump okay you know these guys are just grasping at straws so I mean I think that's why this may not make that much of an impact\nOn them in terms of man I'm so excited and what's going to have better and who's going to run in twenty twenty [laughter] Elizabeth Warren it's\nHillary Clinton going to run again could you imagine if the two of them were competing against each other although a combination of Hillary Clinton as president and Elizabeth Warren is vice president wouldn't get the lives out\nIn full force so we'll see what happens I Hope that doesn't um by\nHaving Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren fight against each other that would be fan ...\nEspecially in today's political climate where it's like no holds barred because if you look at Obama and Hillary Clinton how they sparred with each other back in two thousand and they they were pretty rough\nI mean considering that was pre Trump era those guys were where I'm a mean each other so you know I'd love to see these two Harvey is go at it\nLet's see what else here we've got a cute story about Trump not\nControlling the news cycle a [laughter] [laughter] I think we all know Trump's always going to control the news cycle it says ah Trump's worst nightmare the news cycle that he can't control um\nWho is this by the Daily Beast\nOr yeah I mean that's just silly here Trump comes face to face with the nightmare news cycle he can't control he's been spending the last week trying to gin up media coverage of a caravan of migrants making their way from Honduras to Mexico us border\nYeah I mean you've heard about that caravan right I mean there's like a whole [laughter] it's like just a flood of immigrants who are apparently held that are coming to the United states Mexico has offered them\n[noise] um oh what did they promised that they basically said you know we'll take care of you and they're like no we want to go to the U.S so I I don't know what's going on with this be asked but um\n[noise] the the right as blaming the left saying that it's a conspiracy theory of left is trying to get them across the border to get sympathy for them [noise]\nBut it's backfired and and people are with Trump they don't want these people crossing the border and so now people on the left her thing it's conspiracy theory by people on the rights trying to get them to cross the border so I mean who knows are we just being inundated with October ...\nAcross the border so I mean who knows are we just being inundated with October surprises did did the left go man we need not just one October surprise we need like twelve October surprises\n[noise] okay so I mean I don't know maybe maybe the left or the writer tried to October surprise each other who does but um now we got this shooting what is this all about\nSuspect identified and deadly Pennsylvania synagogue attack police said the suspected gunman forty six they got his name you know I don't like to publicize the name of these more on he's in custody after multiple people were killed and four officers were injured\nIn a Pittsburgh synagogue Trump it's a terrible terrible thing of course it is here great so now we're going to get derailed again with another battle about gun control well I mean you saw they had to get Trump's comment on it I mean he he is he's the president he's going to control the news cycle\nNo matter what that dumb article says [noise] um let's see more evidence of the midterms coming up yeah Facebook is still leaning and other social media is just deleting\n'em right wing accounts\nLiberty means which for years was up\nOn Facebook so libertarian website that has the it's awesome really funny great means on it they're always good for a laugh every time I look at uh [noise] I don't even think a part of the uh yeah I'm not even part of the group\nBut I'll look at 'em sometimes but they're just they've got these hilarious means all rational people would\nThink that they're hilarious I could see a you know other people getting offended by it but uh they're very very funny\nAnd they were kicked off then they came back as liberty means to point out kicked off again with no explanation their baggage liberty and it means three point out we'll see how long that lasts for but you know this just happened in the last week\nSo it is the purge to point out so they're they're purging um people again\nAnd uh I Know that this is a ... who are they purging their purging conservative or not I shouldn't say conservatives because meal kinds aren't getting purge their purging libertarians\nAnd they are purging of far right activists and their purging far\nLeft activists progressive so they're basically purging any anti establishment voices that you might get with a little extra helping of conservatives\nAnd uh this whole uh keep going I don't know if they're going to\nKeep at it after the midterms happen but they are saying that they're getting away with it I don't think they will for a long though I Do believe in the free market I think somebody else is going to step in and and take over you know it might be in five years time maybe seven years but it it'll happen maybe even a lot\nSooner than that I Know this kind of going rapid fire here's an update on the synagogue a shooting there is\nNow ten people dead I mean people were packed in ... I'm surprised that more than that just horrible man just terrible terrible\nOh you gotta be kidding me okay so now they have a little bit about this guy\nHe's a Trump supporter died in the wall Trump supporter according to the story\nAnd he was on a social media platform called gab I talked about gab last week this is so funny as a competitor [laughter] to Twitter\nSo Twitter has been kicking people off right so now they are they're they're now they're going to go after gab you you watch the I mean come on man this is just all\nKind of so perfect here right\nSo let me understand just before midterms all of these far right is decide that now is a good time to commit violence\nUm [noise]\nI mean this this is the smells so bad to me\nBut who knows I mean maybe these people are I mean they're obviously crazy people but I mean maybe it's just what it looks like maybe these guys are triggered an or going out of their committing these things I mean look I'm sure that people on the left goes this has to be a conspiracy theory\nWhen you see people like banging on the on the Supreme Court justices or doors right or if you or or when you see these mobs go out and and masks and stuff they must be like this can't be a real thing or the caravan\nRight coming across they must be like this can't be real this has to be set up but I guess people in the world are just crazy\nThe difference is that I don't blame people for kind of thinking that there could be something up with this because it does seem just such odd timing\nAnd these people cannot think that it's helping their costs to do this well look here's another story suspicious package mailed Cory Booker this was yesterday on that this happened\n[laughter] and this is right above the article that says eleven days until the mid term elections where things stand\nAnd here's another article Eighteen news mail bomb investigation collide with mid term the final week or maybe I spoke too soon maybe they're not going to get out of the cycle although this is from yesterday we'll see if it stays that I Hope the news has enough manpower to cover all these October surprises\nBut you know what they're going to be a thousand October surprise as it doesn't matter because it doesn't change the fact\nThat the Democrats in the country want to take control and money away from the people and they want to give it to the government and the Republicans up sensibly I understand the establishment there but the philosophy of the Republicans is to keep all of this in the hands of the people and to make government smaller and smaller and that's\nAnd find any them in any school of thought when I get that natural life more passive they found that mechanic alike and a nation where it correct and continue to solve that

was Lou Gehrig\nOf Lou Gehrig's disease fame he was a great American baseball player who was dying of Lou Gehrig's disease I ls and he went before his uh be loving audience to the Yankee Stadium and he gave that speech which is still to this day considered one of the most noble speeches ever given by anyone at any time\nAnd the reason I'm playing that speeches biggest Stephen Hawking has died of a a less and um we now learned today that he said there was no God in his final book\nI took umbrage at that for a number of reasons and I asked today on Twitter a few questions about Stephen Hawking as tragic as his life was because ... did it suddenly elevate him\nTo a position greater than it out of a um Albert Einstein how the scientist like Stephen Hawking become demi gods of store suddenly in all fields including theology it's the same question as Dr Ford being bigger now than Dr Freud how did that fraud doctor for Ford\nNoticed they called her doctor for they don't call them ... noticed that just watched out how the media applies labels to people she was Dr Ford everyone in that kind of sanctimonious talk for a doctor how did she become bigger than Dr Freud and how it can become bigger than Einstein\nWell today on the Savage Nation amongst other topic so I'm going to talk about everything you wanted to know about Lou Gehrig's disease and more\nAnd the reason I'm going to do that is\nBecause as I said Stephen Hawking died a while ago and now we're being told today that uh he declared in his final book God is not that he or she never existed in the first place CNN reporter he said no one directs the universe\nNow it disturbed me for a number of reasons why should his thoughts on guard meaning as atheistic thoughts on the non existence of God suddenly supersede that of all of humanity from the beginning of the logical his jury or shouldn't\nBut you'll notice how the media is playing this great role and I asked the question today why is Stephen Hawking considered such a world genius well\nBecause she pushed global warming any now we learned he said there was no God he's an atheist group\nAnd I want to discuss his disease a alas today\nFor two reasons one because of what he said there was no God and we can then segue into what is a a less and other neurological diseases diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's now if you're young

attention to Mozart in the White House\nNow\nBecause there aren't that many classical music lovers so therefore Mozart as irrelevant [noise]\nThat's the world we're living in so if I wake up in the morning and I play certain music it's not only classical don't get me wrong I mean I've known for listening to jazz rock and roll you name it\nBut if I if I really can't if I don't really feel good I play classical music because it humbled me to the point where I Am going to break down inside saying that's impossible at a human being could have lived on this Earth like Mozart\nAnd had a brain that was like that that could conceive music like that to me it's as ... as close as you're ever going to get to God\nAnd it goes back to the fact that there are differences between people and unfortunately for us we're living in a time where everyone thinks they're equal to everyone else because of social media that's the tragic truth\nIf you saw the kind of idiots who are on Twitter or on Facebook to comment on things they do nothing about but because they can fire up a one liner suddenly they're equal to the greatest scientist on earth in fact they're better and this is the problem with social media you could say it's very democratic and levels the playing field no the opposite is true\nAnd with social media you could say it's very democratic and levels the playing field no the opposite is true they haven't qualified to comment at all it's like having a moron in the classroom let's say if you're a teacher and having an idiot in the back who keeps interrupting you\nAnd makes the class pay attention to him because he's got a big mouth and interrupts the teacher so no one learns anything trust me I Know what it's like to be a teacher I Know it's like that but he gets in the classroom will disrupt the class but because of the breakdown of our society and all standards at all forms in every aspect\nOur lives no one knows what's right or wrong anymore very few people do anyway they don't know north from South east from west truth from fall so good from bad\nAnd so therefore if you go on the social media anymore on to take a picture of themselves and now they're more famous than the ... people probably know strip and more than they do Albert Einstein\nI Would say that um the stripper who's attacking Donald Trump is better known today than let's say Martha Washington or something like that ... you see where I'm coming from so anyway to make a long story short so I'm I'm listening to Lou Gehrig sorry I'm listening to the Mozart and I see the article that Steven ... the guy in a wheelchair\nVery tragic don't get me wrong I'm not ... disease it's very tragic disease\nBut it does not make him the genius on every subject on the planet including the kicking the guts today he said that his last book that we just got a glimpse at that I there is no God well I don't get what he said\nHe's one of billions of people said I said something about God but why why is that when I got more than an ex guide isn't\nBut because he was a darling of the American left media suddenly because he said there is no God now all of a sudden that's a big deal\nNow I understand that it's not I don't understand anything that's all I Want to say so I tried to tell you something about cycads\nSay go palm the moral population\nThe relationship to blue green algae and micro toxins that are found in algae and lakes and ponds and rivers and things like that and how it might produce nerve toxins that are related to jail as something like that but it's a long topic for another day maybe I'll do it on my part cast you know what I'm saying\nThey'll come January this is a topic I could do for three days health I may do a regular house segment where I don't have the time to do it on TALK radio because you get you know you've got a different format it's like the way this commercial writer you've gotta you've got to interrupt in order to support your show you need advertisers let's be clear\nIt's a different story with a park as you get a chance to expound and a little more depth with a little more you know inside\nIf you get that chance but anyway I'm not complaining I'm just saying so here we are in the imperfect world try to bring some shots of perfection innocent perfect world\nAnd we're talking about topics that most people are not interested in because instead immediately shift to the word immigration immigration immigration immigration Doris\nYou'd be interested more and you you might want to actually you should be\nBecause I said today what's going on in this country right now with immigration is a disaster it's a disaster that I've been writing about for twenty five years and I try to publish a book right after I got my doctorate in Nineteen Nineteen Seventy nine eighty\nCalled immigrants and epidemics his after I had had six books published already and my co author was the dean of the school of public health brilliant man and nobody in New York would touch the book for political reasons that was then you understand how how much worse it's gotten here today it's gotten worse here today than it was then\nIt's a miracle that I'm Still on the radio but I won't be here in January on some major stations even though my writings for higher than anyone else on the station because of political reasons only make no mistake about it joy and love Savage Nation\nCalled five foreign service [noise]\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and oneself gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to Medicare for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math that six thousand dollars a year that\nThe significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share\nBecause it's very serious that can lead to paralysis in deaths in children\nOn October fourth health officials in Minnesota now says six children contracted a famine acute flash at ... which is ... polio like\nNow the CDC has been investigating this increase in a a ... which begins twenty fourteen but they don't know why it's happening therefore I fired the head of the CDC\nI'd fire him yesterday when he doesn't know what kind of scientists doesn't know what do you mean paid for if you don't get out of there what you like to go to ... vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits\nThey don't get out of there what you like to go to vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits of horses so every every article says the causes of FM are still unclear it's unclear we don't do anything\nBut it's thought today if I may be a communicable disease really well as one link oh in maybe a communicable disease\nAnd certain viruses including polio and Tara viruses that viruses West Nile virus may even cause FM where the west Nile virus come from ... west ... does it say New York virus doesn't\nMean the west Nile virus when it come from or where you can pretty much see what I'm going with this right well you understand what I what I like to see which is close the borders do health screening like was done when your grandfather a grandmother came here a great\nGrandfather when anyone with an illness was quarantine to prevent them from spreading it into the healthy population well\nThose are antiquated ideas you can quarantine anyone no matter what the cities they have that would go against the uh the sensibilities of the American left\nAnd so the healthy population\nIs an increased risk of diseases\nLike this from these third world countries in plain English common sense would dictate you know let a diseased parts of the country I kind of sense if you have a house or apartment we let someone with a communicable disease in your apartment unless you're a moron and San Francisco\nAnd San Francisco probably sleep with a person with a communicable disease to show the good life just they were raised them in a kiss them on the lips the show a good good people they are that's how sick they are\nBut if you have a say nation you say no I don't want to get sick\nSo what I'm saying to you know there's a relationship between some immigrants from some countries on some diseases\nAnd if you're afraid to say it then you're not living in the Soviet Union member I told you I ran into a woman last week and then just walking around them all such from Hungary is shocking when she said this to me she said I come from the Soviet Union and she said\nPeople are more afraid to express themselves politically in America than they were in my country under the Soviet under Soviet rule I was stunned by it you're more afraid to express yourself at home or at work than the Soviets were under under under Stalin\nAnd I put that on the radio two weeks ago and I woke up and there was an article just the other day exactly on that subject that people in America terrified to express themselves because of the insane communist left\nThey're afraid to say one word at work for free they'll be fired\nAfraid to say anything about anything so you're now a prisoner\nIn more fear the ... the Soviet era in America today\nYeah okay well what can you do it's just one man one man against the world shoveling against the tide is very very difficult odd see if\nI write the book stop mass hysteria America's and sadly from the sandwich rouse the Trump which is doing well but not great if not doing as good as the comic books and the comic books\nNot as good as the comic books on the left in the comic books on the right people want simple books and

sometimes that and it seems like he does it based on reason not just on on a desire to please us and he doesn't sit for three hours saluting Trump\nWhich you can gag on that one because I was on Trump to them angry at it's the talk show hosts who thinks that that's all you want to hear that's the part that bothers me\nWhat would you do if if Obama was president and you had a talk show that for three straight hours it's diluted out great Obama was Obama was there so but I'm always great Obama shoes shine bright anyone shoe bomber was smarter how could you listen to that did you listen to it no\nNo the the companies that specialize in left wing propaganda\nIn radio one out of business and then when they lost their jobs they came over to the other stations and they started to get rid of conservatives taking them off the air you don't do any of this oh yeah it's a well known fact in the business\nPeople destroyed their networks by running left for propaganda are now running other media now did you know that even in radio well in one day you'll you'll learn more about it if it's false I wouldn't say it to you so how do you survive it all in this business if you're a truth teller\nThe people will find you one way or the other is that simple they'll find you on line or they'll find you on a podcast or they'll streaming from somewhere that that's how it is so is that that's the way it is now ... what are we going to talk about let's go I didn't take a call earlier this is one of these days I don't know why it's so good\nI Know why I feel good extra extra clear clear like Scientology luckily I don't I'm not a psychologist I knew one guy was in it early on back in Queens he went into it one of the nuts and the crowd he was like one of the biggest already made a fortune became a top guy and sign that I was surprised he went so high up in this thing\nBut he wasn't kids Eighteen everyone's trying to find themselves he became a Scientology I'm Talking ... like in the sixties and I'll wake up twenty as he was like one of the chief goal Rosen Scientology movement but I remember the guy to a certain things they said that were really good\nLike about headaches for example I have suffered migraine since I was a kid\nAnd he tried to have me image the headache and where it came from it actually helped me\nReally helped my migraines and self cured was reading Georgia showers and macro buyout accent I went on to the ten stage diet\nOf elimination I was Eighteen years old and I my own I found out which which food\nTypes triggered by migraines and I rarely get a migraine today unless I slip on that diet for me it was sucrose any any refined sugars will do it for example and I know why exactly because my brain runs very hot and very fast and if it's like throwing rocket fuel into an engine\nI mean that enjoy will run on it but you're going to burn the engine out whether it's in my brain was sending back a single I'm going to give you a headache so you don't burn too fast and burn up that seat this great feedback in your body and your brain if you if you learn how to listen to the signal and you want to understand that\nIf you learn how to listen to your own signaling from your brain and your body you actually could could lead yourself to states of health that you could never even believe were were possible\nBut and here's the bought\nMost of us have lost contact with these signals we don't want to hear them we we eliminated them and we put ear buds in whatever what he would do so I learned to listen to my body over the years it's not always a nice message but\nSometimes I don't want to hear what it has to say to me like don't drink ... shut up leave me alone you know I don't want don't drink at rock it's not good for you today whatever but I I listen to a very close relationship\nSo I took this andme acrobatic diet didn't eliminate should not sucrose insured my headache and the rest is history for me it doesn't mean for you maybe you love sucrose maybe like getting diabetes and cancer and heart disease I Can't stop you if that's what you want\nPeople do crazy things today based on science so the reason I'm happy today on radio is I was able to use my my learning\nMy dissertation going back to Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... study studies that I was interested in them and the relationship to Lou Gehrig's disease today and the statement by Steven all kinds of God doesn't exist because he died of Alice I figured it'll be interesting but do I know if you really listening or maybe you listen to a habit of reading I don't know you\nGot to turn off the list that habit by now because you could hear everything you've ever wanted to know about the administration upgraded is around the clock ham bat\nOnce that part down the middle of his hair and you know it's a terrible thing to be a good looking boy and become not so good looking and you're middle aged man wow I don't know what it's like to be like I was never like a handsome guy I was like and not notice and some I was okay\nI had my share of fun but what I'm saying is what if you live on your looks and you have nothing on any no education and no one no intellect whatsoever and you make a fortune and finally you look in the mirror and no matter what you do you have to park your hair in the middle and looked like a Lou Costello\nIn order to to cover up to the thinning hair and so you're getting ...\nIn order to ... to cover up the defending hair and so you get increasingly desperate to be young and you start breaking bricks with your hand\nAnd then the whole mess manhood thing comes up\nAnd the people while they don't call your tiny I mean that was a terrible thing to do with the president um talk about people in the media they'll call you tiny that's nothing to do with anything where those ties have to do with brains in what does everything have to be everything some people are in doubt mentally somewhere in doubt physically someone that I Would vote someone dealt with nothing that's the human condition what are you gonna do about it\nBut if you're in the media and you're thriving they start with your good looks you're a good guy looks and you asked us to stay in your face starts to look like Jerry Lewis after it tell us on a in the seventies and there's nothing you can do about it I don't know what that's like that's a that's a form of torture and its own way\nAnd then as the years go on the portrait of Dorian Gray gets more and more corrupted you know I don't I think God in his own way has a little way of playing with people who think that they're bigger than God you know\nYou have any idea what I'm Talking about is there any doubt there knows what I mean even talking about I I Wonder sometimes I think there'll be like if I run into people strangely and what's increasingly happening to me is that people have different cultural backgrounds of stopping me in the street like a\nYesterday I had a day off writes I go to a dentist or something just a nice lady said hello to me like she knew me showed up and settle oh she's from Cambodia and she said to me very quietly she said\nI Lived through those camps that poll ... created my relatives were killed in them and live through them and I was stunned the here's a living woman who have you looked during the street would say she's ... she's a liberal said the Democrats are always think that if someone's from Asia there were a liberal or someone's\nAfrican American there were a liberal or someone's gay there you have no idea\nWhat a person's politics are really you can't tell by looking at people you you just can't you know that\nYeah well okay like some cops for example a die hard communist left us you wouldn't know that\nThere are many in the military who you think would be normally conservative Republican they left wing comedies you wouldn't know that either so you can never judge a book by its cover I'll be back in a minute\n... joy both

God suddenly supersede that of all of humanity from the beginning of the ... or shouldn't\nBut you'll notice how the media is playing this great role and I asked the question today why is Stephen Hawking considers such a world genius well\nBecause he pushed global warming and now we learn he said there was no God he's an atheist ...\nAnd I want to discuss his disease a alas today\nFor two reasons one because of what he said there is no God and we can then segue into what is a alas and other neurological diseases diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's now if you're young you

touch it because there's not commercial enough that doesn't mean the book is not valid you could go out today and deal with Amazon related book or any of the other services and they'll they'll Britain publisher promote your book for you\nAnd you don't have to sell that many copies to get some attention and then then part of it is a good part is the book takes off on its own you can then go to a publisher and say look I sold twenty five thousand copies on my own there'll be interested at that time Steve that's how the industry works that I I give us a call now that's a tip for everyone out there who thinks that they're an author\nYou don't need to go to New York could have your heart broken they have a whole different you know parameter for books let's be clear\nAnd they'll say to you if you even get an answer or sorry not for us or\nIts not commercial enough for a good idea if you're lucky enough they'll give you an answer most of the times you won't even get an answer but you can bypass that if you have a book that's a little corky are different and you think it's worth a story worth telling your idea worth expressing\nAnd that is self publishing through one of the major major outlets and I'm promoting it through that service as well by buying some ads and what happens is people will read it if they like it\nYou'll get noticed and then it'll sell and then you go to a publisher at that point where the pre sale of X number of copies it doesn't mean it's gonna work\nNor does it mean if it doesn't work that your book is invalid that could mean that your book is fabulous and the work of genius but the people just aren't ready for it I'll give an example I ask ... ethics cesspool as I Am\nWith my commercial books stop mass hysteria being example number one

actually think it's the greatest work of genius I've ever written\nIt's hasn't sold more than a couple of hundred copies it actually makes me happy to understand that the book is so far ahead of time and that it's not popular enough for the times I had publishes look at it they they were terrified of it because it shows a post feminist world that's act\nAbsolutely indicative of where we are going especially after the Kavanaugh hearings if you're talking about a mass killing the men that was about a physical reality rather than the psychological reality show\nTurned me from thinking it's one of my best books anyway that's what I'm trying to say you gotta keep\nOn keep on keep on doing it don't let anyone tell you know and don't rely on any one person for the opinion of what your work is

yesterday if you'd like one of the polio like symptoms or you can just bring it right into your household\nBut you don't want it in your own backyard you don't want it in your living room you want

heard it before\nI heard it for Thirty years\n[noise] and so this is a big story there's a question about it is for sending the military to close the southern border long overdue as I said yesterday

was just shocking poverty is disclosed for having practice discrimination against Asians and whites and saying that that's not discrimination\nAnd my book bags at the number eleven on the New York times less than I'm moving into a cycle of seven Elevens what does this numerology mean\nAnd we have Gary the numbers go I Hope he's right this time Gary on W. N. T. W. and Virginia Line to what does this mean seven eleven\nAnd you hope I'm right this time last time I was their program I told you Donald Trump your neck for the United states\nSo let's start with that but let's go into your eleventh thing number one there's two ways to look at number eleven number one that we use the number two the way it pops up now let's go to the first nine eleven happened eleven first plane hit the world Trade Center for the Web and nine eleven happened two hundred fifty four to five forty quote the lab and the twin towers looked like an ... number\nTwo hundred fifty fourth day of the year two five four equals eleven the twin towers looked like an ... number eleven ... standing side by side they both have a hundred and ten stories are homeless city happened for Nineteen Nineteen Ninety five\nFor one nine one nine Ninety five after thirty eight three Nate adds up to eleven first bomb went off at nine o to do the math again eleven and then executed Timothy McVeigh for on the eleventh\nSo basically what is going on here because obviously that's not going to be I can understand that number has five racial energy that\nPeople who are in power are very we're very aware of this now if you think on line ask yourself why World War one ended at eleven eleven at exactly eleven o'clock they didn't fire shot that tend to be five they waited till eleven\nOr hold on what to seven cycles of eleven plus two of my last book sitting number Lebanon the New York times list and your mind mean for me\nIs that what it means in my mind is what it is and basically what it is is that you are having an emotional impact on people with a lot\nThat's what it basically breaks down to\nYou have to understand that when average you see the number eleven whether it's the weather Charlottesville when they made sure to have ... or they have to say the figures or it doesn't matter where you go with this\nNumber eleven is going to touch people emotionally I'll give you an example of how this works I'm lying\nLet me interject for a minute my friend Vernon ... who is a promised\nSaid this he said Dr Savage the number eleven is considered a master number is the most powerful neurological vibration\nRemember you send vibration he said simply say to the double one is the number of awakening\nWhen it shows up at the notes that the catalytic the message is being relayed which will serve to inspire eliminate motivate additionally seven as the number of wisdom knowledge and enter reflection therefore seven cycles of eleven only magnifies that concept of awareness which sets in motion a change of or a breakthrough for you my best learning what do you think about that\nI Would agree with the lives that and the way you can show again the way you verify this if you look at the way they do not want average everyday people do what they do they're in a store called seven eleven all around the world is that it's obviously those two numbers go very well together\nThat's generic that's a generic statement what does it mean with regard to my my numbers eleven coming up all the time\nNot generic at all because the only way to verify this stuff actually work it's a look at the people at the top of the game and see how they're actually doing things\nSo yes they're doing things under eleven energy but the what your friend told you was only the positive side there's negative side lumber eleven to that's why al ... was form on August eleventh that's why it hit New York on nine eleven that's why they hit ... pain on three eleven that's why they moved from India after eleven so there's two sides of the coin Savage\nAnd energy so what are you saying\nWhat I'm saying is this you are touching people alive with your words you have a gift for writing and that's exactly why your books are reaching number eleven it's our New York times to manipulate and lift up a number of that's coming out because you're having the most emotional\nBut wait a minute the book before Trump's ... before I got paid the reason was number one on the New York times list that's another one uh one than a Lebanon eleven so white Vernon says Savage first of all I predict stunning results for the podcast venture he says you'll get more or less\nJust from other age groups of demographics it's going to be huge and he goes on from there well scary you don't want to make any predictions though you\nMay I Will make you a prediction that when it comes down to this point won't be proved to be a fraud\nThank you very much for saying something I don't know nothing about nor I Know why even put that in there but that diminished everything you've said before joining the Savage Nation Coleman oh eight five four hundred and Seventy five or more of a seven to eight to

can\nAlso another words the kid who comes from a family where the parents killed themselves to be educated and to keep the kittens so like should we punish now\nNo I'm saying this is\nYou are you saying yes you're saying automatically because if a kid\nNo I'm saying this is\nWhat you are you're saying yes you're saying automatically because if a kid comes from my house so let's say there is no father which by the way it's not even a racial thing anymore let's say there's no father at home with a single parent\nAnd let's say a there he's poor and he lives in a terrible neighborhood how do you explain all of the poor whites who came out of tremendous poverty\nAnd yet excelled in school how do you explain that\nI I Am in favor for profit for its I realize that\nThe you know that there was a time at Harvard that Jews were not permitted into Harvard or you know that\nFor something that\nYou know let let me just explain it I've studied this in great detail that was a time the Jews were prohibited from entering harbor did you know that\nYes I flew into that yet\nAnd yet some kids won't let them because they were so brilliant their scores were so high there was a genius was they finally let 'em in okay\nNow we've turned it around where you're the stupidity or the higher your chances of getting a no he's not my friends stop with the words like homelessness to me to me homelessness has no meaning that's a left wing phrase to make you feel guilty and the other word is disadvantaged what do you think every person in this country was white has an advantage you\nBelieve in white privilege no that's why that's why this would help poor white kids ... and for the you know in other words if\nYou're thinking you're increasing the way that you have for their relative achievement in school with they grow up and you're making\nA good point but how fair is that\n[noise] I think it's fair\nNo that's like saying being a big fish in a little pond as opposed to being a small fish in a big pond\nExactly right so you're saying take the big fish from the small pond and then when that kid who thinks she's great from Appalachia because he got straight days in a high school of a underperforming or poor performing kids winds up an elite college so called there are no such things anymore unless they're in the hard science as the rest is all trash\nUnless you're the hard science has no such thing as an institution that's better than the other all of the others mishmash of direct\nIn plain English but let's say you take the kid who was number one an Appalachian high school and you put them into a so called Ivy League school and then he ... he faces kids who've been studying since they're one year old how is he gonna do\nHell hell hole improvement self at a young age rather than trying to get social justice what his forty years old and ... and he doesn't\nSay well you're assuming you will is you're making an assumption that because you let him into that elite school is going to become a fair minded person\nI've seen the opposite I think the people that were given an unfair advantage to become worse because then they expected their whole life and then it gets out of a Princeton and Harvard or Yale whatever and then when he goes for a job and then he goes into the corporate world and then what is he the man you hire me around what I'll show you\nKnow know what can\nYou ask anybody in the corporate world what they have to put up with with kids would come out of these schools who use the very same tactics they used to get into the schools in the corporation they will sue you with the drop of a hat everybody knows this\nThe thing is people listening doing saying how dare even say it I Know what goes on in this country what should I hide what's real\n\nWell we disagree on this one I say no don't get any won a special advantage either it's equal to every one or it's not equal at all is that simple you know there's no such thing as a reverse racism\nThose words don't have any meaning either it's racism or it isn't racism so if your school Asians are whites because they're doing too well that's racism\nAnd you know I thank God the Asians finally sued this has been going on since Nineteen Seventy eight that so [noise] but no one who's ... listen to the show they're too busy working a four\nAnd five forty seven to eight to now before I take\nA break I Can't wait for the park has come January\nCan I tell you a bit about it we have big podcast meeting this morning I have a team of sixteen people it's so it's going to be amazing here's how it's going to work the show is going to be alive this first hour on the stations that carry me\nNow some stations will not carry me not because the ratings are annoying Norman's ratings but because we are going to be going into the cycle of of the election and liberals are running some of these stations that taking me off the air that's the way it is I don't care what they tell you that's what's happening\nOkay but the rest of your we'll get we'll hear the radio show for an hour and then anybody can hear the podcast for free there's no charge for it anywhere in the world at any time and I suspect that it'll be one of the largest broadcaster in the world and so all predictors indicate that it will become one of the most important part Kass on the planet\nAnd if you don't believe me wait until January you wait and see what's going to happen so one way or the other the gatekeepers are going to go whether it's at Harvard or on the radio business it's that simple they can try all they want to destroy any station in the world and get away with it but you know what if you have the truth the truth is going to set you free\nK B.

I Wonder what ... I Wonder when Obama's SAT scores were to get into Harvard does anyone know I\nKnow there was an FBI investigation of Kavanaugh's junior high school records his a grade school records nursery school records but to this day we don't know if Obama even took a course and passed them\nI'm sure they feel like\nI'm waiting I Will say this he got straight days in in in the icing the public he was pretty good at throwing the wind yeah what did you what did you do with your life clean after your rejected by this medical school because she went to white\nEye I ended I ended up going to different medical school in the Midwest and graduate and they try and from my medical school class\nOr in a while so it's a success story in a way it yes yes yes but it left you with a wound in your stomach in your heart didn't it\nBut yeah you know you just say I work and work and work and I see people and they start checking on the admission process to professional school whether that law or medical school it continues on and when you go to apply for residency [noise]\nAre you kidding of you've taken a look in the in the hospitals when you go and what it looks like now like a third world nation\nYes it does and I I\nAm I roll over and I don't know whether it's Obama Osama bin Laden or a savior coming to the treatment\nYes and not to mention the fact that now we don't have a fish and uh basically within that says the Asian hospitals anymore as independents patients are all\nWithin that says the Asian hospitals anymore as independents missions are\nUp here you are telling an important story in Haiti or a successful woman who still has the scars of affirmative action that's the whole point now you're such a loyal compulsively or did you yet acquire a copy of stop mass hysteria\nNo\nNo ... ...

things that I bought that will never used in my life I don't know why buy them if I'm not using them\nI buy like a beautiful frying pan so I don't have the ... so I hooked on that last night the food tasted different tasted better I didn't taste I don't know what I think the kids the nuns skin plastics are breaking off into our food there's no question about it no matter what they tell you it's like bottle of water I got to tell you this I was drinking\nI should mention the brand let's say a plastic bottled water for years because I didn't want the fluoride and I didn't want some of the

our troops for our thing there to defend the protect America water troops for what the living for the pension asserted that was so over white they can't even pick up a gun\nThey belong on disability support the ones that are able to carry a gun on the border and say you're not coming in and that's the end of it let it go take care of them had sent it back where they came from after the given the care that they need what is wrong with you people how many people can we take into this country cowards on the run I saw this this morning I got so angry I was live at the\nMoment that I looked at her turns on cowardly hunters after they gunned down a bull elephants\nIf you'll listen to that the sounded those elephants after one of their bull elephants are shocked by these too fat pieces of garbage so there's a herd of beautiful noble creatures a family of elephants a herd of elephants which are more nobility the most human beings\nAnd these two fat disgusting\nSo called hunters both saying for the same below ... and they just shooting between the eyes this was in Namibia should these too fat gunman aim at the beach from a distance as one says to the other hand it between the eyes\nOr both of the fat ugly hunters hit one of the bowls and stumbles and then the\nTwo men too fat white man in shorts turn and run screaming has heard turns on them you'll hear you trumpet erupting from one of the elephant says the hunters become the hub [noise]\nNow I got to tell you something I Believe in self defense dot hunting defenseless write that one down [noise] I Believe in self defense not hunting as the senseless [noise]\n\n\nAre you putting your retirement savings in a four O. one K. IRA or investment account and I have one word and my advice\nStop many experts warn of a stock market crash any day now and if it's anything like the last two crashes you could lose fifty percent or more of your heart or in savings in a Wall Street casino can you afford to lose happier\nRetirement savings again hey you don't have to lose a penny because there's a better safer way to save for retirement and you can learn all about it in a free report this is the report Wall Street and big banks desperately hope you'll never see why because this method continues to grow your money even when the markets ...\nThey let you take back control of your money and finances\nAnd it gives you a penalty free access to your savings plus can beat the pants off any four O. one K. or IRA these are uncertain time so get the information you need today to guarantee your retirement security to get this free report go to a bank on yourself dot com right now that's bank on yourself dot com\nFor being for being too smart correct\nA social service or it's a riverside you in other words ... using the riverside to admit people dumber you are the better off you are\nYeah well you have to understand is that true purpose of affirmative action and these quotas the the true purpose is to make sure that a white liberals maintain that at least the plurality but ideally a majority on campus because if they don't have to have the numbers\nThen we will reached a tipping point for white people no longer want to go to schools like Harvard and they'll end up like Cal Tech and Berkeley were basically they're dominated by Asians and not because Asians um\nHave necessarily the best of everything but white liberals no longer want to go there because they don't feel like they're in the majority anymore [noise]\nSo what are you actually saying there is there are there isn't discrimination against Asians\nSerious discrimination against their agents for what I'm trying to say that Asians actually have the highest benchmark the highest standard of all the races followed\nBy white there the standard basically the benchmark and blacks Hispanics Native Americans actually at points added during the process of admissions to their formula\nRight well that's what came out during the ... the trial now in in Cambridge the Asian American suit Harvard and found out that they are being top loaded ... against them their scores have to be higher to even be considered\nA higher and higher than any of the race that's a that's the main point and the purpose behind that again is not for diversity but to make sure that white liberal\nDo not fall into the minority because then they would reached that tipping point right just like we have white flight in the cities and yes white flight here in northern California white people no long no longer want to live in neighborhoods that are ... predominantly Asian\nSame with the colleges so Harvard and Yale\nDamage your white people don't want to live in Asia neighborhoods does that affect\nEver have you ever seen neighborhoods in Fremont Cupertino San Francisco where all the white people go where the public school\nHow wait wait a minute how come Nancy Pelosi has and fled yet\nBecause first of all she's a grandmother and second of all her kids if they go to school for grandkids I should say we'll go to private ... high schools\nIn other words it doesn't apply to her\nFor Iraq\nSo what what do you think needs to be done to make things fair for everyone\nWill obviously the missions formula has to be done applies equally fall races you can't have a penalty for being Asian and a lot of points just for being black or Hispanic Native American the way it is today and we have to let\nThe urine admissions consulting so let's look at Harvard for example or yellow prince and the same thing applies to all of these schools have subjects that are extremely difficult but you can't fake whether it be astrophysics for organic chemistry or things like that are you telling me that the kids who admitted\nWith these rigs scores are able to compete in those classes\nHit the nail on the head they don't major in physics for electrical engineering\nSo what do the kids who are admitted under these weeks than is what are they major in\nTheir major in anything with the words studies after it was her\nCommend [laughter] that's funny you let me of the studies the examples of what they major in\n... even environmental science which is a bogus science\nYes of course that's environmental studies which means whatever you want to make it into this not a science social studies going through a metal is if you want to if you want to go look at bums in the street that social studies\nDon't go into a math department at Harvard for the electrons entering parliament at MIT and what do you see it's all Asia the white people don't want to go there anymore\n... wait a minute this all Asians biggest whites can't get in because they're not smart enough or they don't even apply\nApply their intimidates they get what are they in what what are they intimidated by\nYou know exactly what I'm Talking about their intimidated by seeing so many hardworking Asians and they sit there and they think oh my God I'm not going to be able to fly through college I'm going to go and major in something easier and usually the cop\nOut you're actually saying the white kids are afraid to go to Harvard now\nOr the yes they are for certain majors I of course they're never going to have any trouble majoring in history right as long as they follow the party line\nWhat I don't know where you're coming from actually you're starting to be will demean now I don't quite know what you're saying on one hand you're saying that the admissions are rigged against whites and Asians and then you're saying that whites are cowardly and don't even want to apply\nWhat I'm saying like oh is that there are academic get ... academic ghettos for Asians or guess what the stem feels feels where they dominated by the the lesser students go away towards away from them because\nThose are you you're not in ... you're not implying that they are white students can't make it an electrical engineering or are you\nNot at all not at all I'm I'm implying that there are many fewer or because they are as many of them are intimidated by\nThe show where where there's a white kid will stray apply if he wants to go into electrical electrical engineering where we apply\nApply to MIT they can apply to Cal Tech or even Berkeley right foot\nAnd they and they don't have the same skewed admissions policies\nWell they can get in based on a formula but they're not to ... ... ...\nOh you mean ... actually the one of the worst examples\nOf course they are they they ... the standard for everyone right they they\nPlan to say they set the standard for racism now Harvard that's they knew that the new distinction\nCorrect they they uh they penalize Asians and everyone else followed them because again they didn't want to reach the tipping point for the student body because majority Asian when that happens that all the white liberals are going to leave and where do they go from there\nI I have a PHD from UC Berkeley and I remember what was going on there was so many Asians because they're good students they study are they come from families that pushed them very hard for the whole tiger mother thing their background is won a scholarship and learning or else you're a loser it's that simple so I admire them and I would see the number of agents growing growing growing you know what I say that people\nI don't care if it's a hundred percent Asian it wouldn't matter to me if they all got an based on brains it wouldn't matter to me at all\nAnd so said Reagan back when he was governor of California for basically go to Berkeley saying what do you see you see hardly any white students correct\nI haven't been there and twenty I won't even go over the bridge okay\nThat's correct I haven't been there and twenty I won't even go over the bridge okay\nYeah I Know I ... I basically never go to the East Bay I have nothing jarring me that's kind of sad I used to love Berkley I won't go there it's heartbreaking to go there the last I went there and looked like a male stream of insanity of all they do is ride on the campus I mean there was no reason for me to go there\nSo you're saying that the world has shifted so dramatically but isn't this um lawsuit going to straighten things out a little bit\nWell it depends you and I both know that it's probably got a wife or the court system\nFor many years and of course Harvard and all the uh didn't leave a paper trail and they were they were given carte blanche to do this by the hockey decision back in Nineteen Seventy eight where you could use race as a factor law have explicit quota\nBut didn't they didn't write the quotas down they just put it in their heads and say okay every time we get an age students subtract points\nEvery time we have a black Hispanic Native American\nIn your opinion that has a society benefit benefited from affirmative action\nNot at all because when you look at for example at the top two universities see the under represented minorities have a much lower graduation rates and the wife on the Asia and they don't tend\nTo what about the lawsuits against the university I as anyone calculated what percentage come from which race\n[noise] yes of course it's been calculated for example the acceptance race by race so the acceptance race race race by race a white people with the exact same standard as an Asian have tripled acceptance rate of an an Asian students for\nExample and a Spanish student conversely has tripled acceptance rate of all white students with the exact same statistics [noise]\nIt's a terrible situation when you're a young person who's working hard to be knocked out because of the way you you look in your race it's horrible and I and it's the opposite of what our U.S Constitution and bill of rights permits more specifically and violates proposition two oh nine\nWhich is a state law but of course in a lawless state propositions don't mean anything unless they advanced the Marxist agenda\nUniversity of California did to the to get around it when they did is they hired more black Hispanic initials officers and readers for throwing admissions process\nThose admissions officers were obviously more sympathetic towards black Hispanic students\nAre you yourself Asian or Caucasian or what\nI Am an agent who attended uh Berkeley and five schools as well wow so\nYou know what hard workers weren't you driven by your parents to succeed\n[noise] yes I was and so we're all of my family and\nI was I I mean ... either we made it all you can sue outcasts and in my world honest to God we were pushed\nThat's how that's how a kid makes you can't tell them that if he can't study as alert and what is it called now learning anxiety that's now a disorder can you believe this test test anxiety is a new disorder\nCrazy well thank you for doing this work it's amazing it's a it's astounding to me what kind of people we get calling the show from across this country\nSuffer the pain of discipline or suffer the pain of regret put that over your gym mushy exercise machines just hand write it on a boat on a piece of cardboard suffer the pain of discipline to suffer the pain of regret and it goes to everything you're doing in your life I'll be right back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "18", "locations": [["Jacksonville", 30.33218, -81.65565], ["Saudi
