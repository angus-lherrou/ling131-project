B. obey\nHere over the top stories were bringing you this morning many Florida counties are seeing record increase there's this year in early voting compared to twenty fourteen\nAfter Saturday's synagogue shooting leaving a loving bed the Washington Times reports that some of the left are trying to find a way to blame this on President Trump\nAnd Florida governor's and US Senate races all tied according to the latest polls\nContact and the damn six and one on one man who calls to to to\nTo find ... emailed him and you'll be Monday morning\nHit is dean along with Roger Henderson right here on TALK radio W.

John now but as a Saturn Erie county's involve\nExactly yeah and a lot of people are getting out to the polls this year early they don't want to stand in line\nYeah well some of them already are standing in line or especially in South Florida and we're going to get to all those numbers Republicans think that they're doing pretty good the numbers may be a little bit different as up later today\nHybrid buddy ... dean here along with Roger Anderson let's get to synagogue shooting leaves tended over on Saturday Robert powers faces twenty nine federal charges some which are punishable by death\nLoving chance of using a firearm to commit murder and multiple accounts of hate crimes obstruction of exercise their religious beliefs resulting in death kind of thing out some of these laws are described\nAs four weeks before the shooting Bowers targeted Jews and frequent post on social media platforms and also a use anti Semitic slurs complained that President Trump was surrounded by too many Jewish people he ...\nHis family his in laws are Jewish come out with his son in law yeah you can't blame the Jews for the migrants caravans in Central America despite the less effort to blame this on Trump according to Washington Times the shooter was somewhat critical of the president\nThe federals reports isn't it ironic that the same liberals who want to blame Trump for all of this nonsense especially with the synagogue shooting over the weekend\nRecently fought to prop up the world's most powerful Jew hating terror state lecturing on the importance of combating anti Semitism let's get to the clubs Howard Kurtz from Fox media the media buzz again the laughter Democrats trying to blame Trump\n\nOK yeah is that you got it on your critics are saying the president and he'll be gone beyond partisan political competence outright demagoguery against racial minorities foreigners and prominent Jewish political figures in my heart absolutely\nBreaks for this tightening the Jewish community in Pittsburgh where this hateful shooting took place in a place of worship the shooter had a history of anti Semitic social postings are again you know allowed ta ram rave\nBut as far as President Trump I mean there were many mass shootings one block Obama was president including the tragedy of the nine African Americans killed in that South Carolina church so from the press perspective it's not like the violence began with the Trump administration's\nAdrian al rod former director of communications for the Clinton campaign says despite what that may have been true still a lot of this rhetoric in violence who's to blame but the the President Trump\nOn there and go on line for a long time before I signed on going out for a long time that there is an airline threat to the pipe bomb ... today and I hope the president and do a lot of faith when Garland for political party however\nSponsor belly everything here she'll bring this country we got her and not for Africa won't try it\nAgain the media is not saying that from President Trump but Sarah Fisher from Axios dot com she's a media reporter she says everybody keeps blaming Trump but yet again looking up all the criticism we've seen where he got Johnny Depp and Madonna joking around almost want to bomb and blow up the White House and assassination\nBut then again when you got the media out they're calling Trump Hitler Nazi wants to and those are the black race wants to and other those out there as well Sara Fisher says the media sometimes has\nTo take responsibility of what are your reports\nScientists are ... the ... a gallon from how\nBut in fact is not what caused the particular he was talking before about an hour and they need\nTo understand why some supporters here when it comes from ... and the truth is like that by the way which makes them feel that way I could account earlier this year I found out prowling channeling twelve have lost their job preparing to political queens that we're taking one side or not there are a lot on how to do it by the way\nThe median going overboard about their ... throws half a cup accountability for ... living in an environment where it can be difficult\nSo I guess what they're saying is that if you want to go after one side well which is below ... system to go out for both sides\nOf the media you know ... that would be the computer's good things to do and I always feel a little bit ... a weird because when someone in their own private time on a private account says something could lose their job over it which are typically has nothing to do with the ... are held was responsible for those things\nBut when you look at it a ... it's it's kinda like some of the consistency you know the media and the dams blame Trump rhetoric for the attempted violence of Caesar so yeah that's the guy who now has been the crazy guy I'm by the wall you fall sly people out there and you're listening\nAnd the the pictures on the van had been around for a long time they just won't be released claiming that the the the pictures of CNN sucks and and President Trump they act like oh it's too clean believe it was just it was just it was\nIt was planted no gave it up there for some time he was a delivery driver according to the people who work with anyway\nSo this is this is the question I'd like to ask you this is all blamed just on rhetoric in rhetoric only now that's where I Want to preface this Ross okay\nEven blame on rhetoric\nAnd rhetoric only\nCesar ... is now again he's not the problem ... he was a supporter of President Trump ... so Trump's criticism of the media and a Democrat is the ... that's what we're told now is the reason why ... Sundays mail packages whatever okay so let's see we go down that path\nThen what about shooters do mass shootings like you saw this guy over the weekend\nThat absolutely had nothing to do with the and our hey the n._r._a. doesn't talk about any type of political rhetoric I mean there are nonpartisan right there are some Democrats out there exactly but yet if this is based on political rhetoric why they always play for you that you feel when I ... is that if there\nThat is a very question something I had not considered but yeah\nOh he's playing for a few things going on ... is that if there is that is a very question something I have not considered but yeah the n._r._a. typically gets blamed for every shooting none of these mass\nShooters forever members of the n._r._a.\nMay I also go back to thousands sixteen Michael Johnson shot and killed I posted all this on the Facebook over the weekend shot and killed five Dallas police officers ... member that you have to probably protests led by black lives matter\nThe ... he was also a fan of the new Black Panther party and the nation of Islam by the way President Obama\nPresident Obama defended black lives matter member this guy went on the shootings were thought the black lives matter of getting a raw deal the protests that happened during the shooting was put on by black lives matter out there right ... the new Black Panther advocates violence against blacks ... advocates against those eradicating Jewish out there\nWith fifty four percent of likely voters ready to get favorably Democrats are spending millions in ads to make that point of polling data on Obamacare has also moved many Republicans to the left\nMy job I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre existing conditions\nIn August President Trump signed an executive order permitting short term plans which Obama Care for it as a way to cover pre existing conditions for this month's Senate Democrats tried but failed to overturn the matter who gained control of Congress in November the debate over Obamacare may intensified\nProof of that old Washington adage that it is easier to give them to take away ah but\nInteresting Republicans who oppose Obamacare mandates now supported here's the latest commercial by governor Rick Scott says he supports forcing insurance companies to cover pre existing conditions\nI Want to tell you about a family with increased health condition I grew up in public housing rarely saw Dr King had it to the ... mile charity hospital and getting treatment\nThat wasn't my family growing I support foreseen insurance companies to cover the conditions\nAh did you hear that yeah let me play a little more time\nI support foreseen insurance companies to cover the condition of it's just another political issue\nFor me personally toilet\nSo for senator Nelson it's just a political issue but what what what do you say for who I hold a woman that what did he say whether\nIt's just another political issue\nFor me personally it's personal for\nHim it's personal right now I like to ask a question if Obamacare was so bad and it needed to be totally revamped repeal and replace it always been curious what the replacement as\nBenefit needs to be repealed would you not also repeal the area of pre existing conditions out there now the Republicans are books this is probably if I'm not mistaken individual mandate this is probably what number one number two reason why that they want to do it because of a pre existing conditions so I think\nIt's really encourage you to know that uh that that the politicians regardless of their political affiliation are responding to the will of the people must be a pre existing conditions mandates\nIs kind of baked in ... as a as a phrase we've used already but I Do find it interesting that the group that came up with the idea of the individual mandate and um that the Heritage Foundation back in Nineteen Ninety three as bad as a Republican group that was a member of a ... who is is that Newt Gingrich was a member of it that one of the key leaders and now you have Republican\nAnd they were wrong I mean on the theory is correct it at once it's like a group health insurance plan everybody plays into it it becomes much ... you ... the costs become much more sustainable\nYou think there's any truth to the accusation that a big part of people wanting Obama appear to be repealed and replaced which is that they wanted to deny him the legacy for political reasons\nI don't know I mean it it says but but here's the problem now they're supporting us like this and I know governor Rick Scott out there they want to get elected that's right and I use the poll numbers out there so he wants to get elected on this issue President Obama was on the campaign trail again saying Republicans\nThere's a lot about everything but I make up everything out there you do a good job on\nHave exaggerated\nDidn't work out [noise]\nBut what we have not seen before [noise]\nOur reasons public lively [noise]\nPoliticians just blatantly\nWe haven't seen that before [laughter] what's he talking I Am not a crook [laughter]\nI I Am not a crook right oh my word Hillary Clinton are you ready for this year was asked um where are you gonna run again she says now but then again I might do listen to what she said she says our country is so confusing\nAnd I might do listen to what she says she says our country is so confusing to other countries have no clue about us which could be kind of good but she says because of you people voting for Trump you made this country confused\n[noise] hunting hunting you want to run again now\n[noise] now why\nWell I'd like to be president\nHopefully when we add a Democrat in the oval office in January of twenty Twenty one\nThey're going to be so much work to be done I mean we have everybody in the world including ourselves and we're confused our friends and our enemies like they have no idea what the United States stands for what we're likely to do what we think it's important I felt\nWell she might have a point I mean we knew what it was all about every President Obama hey Roger Iran other countries that will sit back and do a business where there is sometimes people would sit back and say this was kind of like a construction project we're all over the map but sometimes that can be a little good\nYeah I'm thinking this could be part of our foreign policy strategy you know keep them keep a guest and that's that's not a bad thing people don't want\nTo know what's going to be taking place with that Jillian Turner says that immigrants must show a reason if they want to seek asylum but they're not being truthful about\nSecurity officials also stressed the keeping of asylum seekers out in the U.S when the ... border is a difficult\nOne to the Caribbean or ride its members have what's known as a credible fear tasks they got to demonstrate their reasons for not wanting to return to their home country are legitimate\nBut according to US Customs and immigration enforcement quote the extremely low ... incredible fear is ripe for fraud and it'd be a silent systems being exploited by those simply seeking economic opportunity not those fleeing persecution\nBut I'm told by everybody out there than the reason why these people by the way you've been deported five six seven eight times where I watched an opposing but coming back or political refugees no there wasn't there are seeking economic opportunity if they are\nI understand that here's my question what economic opportunity or they seek it you know what I'm saying\nYeah you apply for a job but what job you can apply for the company you exactly maybe uh maybe some illegal at a prize hopefully God interesting Mars is as we

our ... is the three hour an hour or two but the three fast as ours anywhere and morning talk radio here and the state of Florida again dean Roger Henderson you don't have to agree but at least Roger they have to admit that entertaining that's\nRight very entertaining program to wake up to every morning so let's get to it as we continue to move along at\nDean here I guess what Ron just Santa said the latest numbers out there and show that Andrew Gillum according to the CBS tracker poll has Rick Scott and Bill Nelson tide will get to that in a moment\nBut Ron just saying is is internal poll say he's up by one or two but the latest CBS tracker poll shows Andrew Gillum is leading Ron dissenters by one run Assange is was in South Florida are you ready for this\nThe crowd response to Andrew Gillum guess how they respond to him lock him up and I'm like you are inclined to me because of the FBI investigation that\nIs pretty much taking place certainly numbers show that the Republicans are up\nWhen it comes to some of the early voting and absentees but Democrats say that they'll make of that difference Roger remember about two weeks ago Republicans were leading them about nine percentage points that number's been dropped about about two point eight Democrats say what the early voting that they plan to make it up record numbers\nEven I think ah even reports or as a in Sarasota do all the legality South Florida under democratic counties showing double or triple digit increases in early voting than data over two thousand fourteen so do its for Republicans to act like this was a shoo in I don't think so\nThat's right and you know we don't expect this produced typically with you know off year elections like we're in the midterms right now the turnout satisfy we've seen almost a tripling of the people participating ... at least early voting so far this year it's amazing\nMay I ask a question in cities like Jacksonville\nOrlando\nGifford, Florida a predominantly black communities but ... but in heavy for example like Orlando Jacksonville that the ... big chunk of the Democrats are made up by those in the black community Roger right when you look at me straight for okay um yeah I Know you're taxing lot more [laughter]\nThis is just as you get your order down here in a moment you want to get it yet\nAre we seeing these souls to the polls out there or are we seeing what we've seen I mean I was at church on Sunday where the pastor says we do not endorse anybody in this you know it it didn't it for office there are recommendations by a group along with it could be biblical\nDays out in the foyer Roger if you want to see them then you go back in and take a look at that and let's see what's you know that's how they do it but have we seen this in the black communities right now the black churches whether they're Baptist rainy are we seeing the souls to the polls were ballots are normally filled out and tell you how to have we seen anything about\nThat I haven't heard anything about that first year at all so far I think people were making their minds of a lot of it especially the amendments are a little confusing I think the people at the time it was Robert overall voting I don't think I see that there's you know\nWe don't see that whatsoever to CBS tracker poll against shows a tie between Bill Nelson and governor Rick Scott\nLet me start with a couple of states that I think will tell the story at least early on election night I'll watch it next week the first is Florida and that race we have tied between Rick Scott and the incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson\nScott seems to get a boost from his handling of the recent hurricane there that may be helping him out\nAgain majority of the increases double digit in triple digit increases this year compared to that of two thousand and four teen\nRichard Bowers how many all know what the name right again the the synagogue shooting do we have it right or I'm Sorry it's Robert Ballard\nKilled eleven over the weekend\nHe faces twenty nine charges somewhat your punishable by the death penalty plus multiple counts of\nHate crimes out there as well before the shooting powers targeted Jews in frequent posts on social media platforms to use anti Semitic slurs complained the president Donald Trump was surrounded by too many Jewish people and blamed the Jews for helping migrant caravans\nAnd Central America Washington Times reports on Monday that despite the less efforts are trying to find some way to blame President Trump media buzz Howard Kurtz says the media rhetoric they'll send you to be held accountable especially when you look at the track record of what's take place with rhetoric and violence over the last several years\nRecently I mean it's not one sided doesn't the press also have a responsibility to be more careful in what's reported in inflammatory language on attacks you know there's a long history here in a blame game depending on who the target is just so we talked about the security at the Republican and a baseball practice last year in\nVirginia Steve squeeze almost killed and the the the guy who hated Republicans\n... ... ... left wing rhetoric can't be blamed for that so I'm trying to do that people like Rachel Maddow show she had absolutely nothing to do with this guy watch Fox News the mailbox and it had nothing to do with and this goes back to you know Sarah Palin being blamed even recently by the New York times when the shooting of Gabby Giffords she could she put out a political map\nWhen Timothy McVeigh below appeal while I'm a city federal building Bill Clinton went out to Rush Limbaugh for fostering a climate of hey this has to stop the these are not the people responsible we should hold him accountable when they go too far in their rhetoric including the president and others including the media\nBut the Democrats don't see it that way former communications director Adrian ... says that the violence that's taken place and the rhetoric still is to be blamed at the top\n... on the line for a long time last night and going out for a long time there is kind of a threat to the pipe bomb they said oh today and I hope private I Do a lot of state run Garland for political party however\nSponsor barely ... countries that are not far from President Trump\nAnd the media is not seen that from President Trump maybe the media needs to report instead of all the other people on CNN calling Trump big it wants to eradicate those in the black community\nAh also wants to eradicate 'cause he doesn't like Jews as funny that's mere largest got out of West palm but all the other areas out there where he just wants to get rid of all the people do ask whole countries that's what we also heard over the weekend unfortunately\nOut there when it came to this here's the question\nIf we're going to use the guilt by association if you wanted to weigh it out Roger and wouldn't want to do play dead but everyone else it is to what's taking place when you look at the mass\nMurders in shooters would you blame on the right would you blame on the left I mean when you saw the uh the shooter that their jak almost killed\nTo five ... or email or you'll be\nPresident Obama was back on the campaign trail you know talking about how hey you didn't build this that's right Trump thrown by made in the town I mean there have been I drove the car in the ditch and whatever he says the Republicans are notorious like Trump for making up things politicians for lion [noise]\nPoliticians have exaggerated\nThen it turns out to be harder to\nDidn't work out [noise]\nBut what we have not seen before [noise]\nOur recent public like\nJust blatantly\nKnow we've never seen like like maybe I mean if you want to play the part is and label here you know what twenty five hundred dollars you can say keep your doctor as you know what rocket a kick you off your plan a he said\nThat all after he told people that the insurance rates would go up and you may have to lose your doctor\n[laughter] speaking out this big caravan continues to what is it maybe thirty days away Jillian Turner from Fox News says that\nWhen those out there that are coming to this country talked about why they're showing up here by the way the Washington Post offices reported that many of these individuals have been deported many times\nThat they're not being truthful with ice agents\nIsland seekers out in the U.S when the ... the border is it difficult can\nOnce the Caribbean or ride its members have what's known as the credible fear cast they got to demonstrate their reasons for not wanting to return to their home country are legitimate but according to US Customs and immigration enforcement quote the extremely low bar for establishing credible fear is ripe for fraud and abuse\nOr asylum systems being exploited by those simply seeking economic opportunity not those fleeing persecution exacerbating crisis after crisis at our southern border and keeping those who truly need asylum in the back of the line and the numbers bear this out the past decade has seen an exponential surgeon people claiming credible fear\nIt jumped from five percent of migrants entering the U.S in two thousand six thirty nine percent in twenty sixteen and [noise] I don't mean to a fish will say this high percentage of things to good organization and planning\nYou know I'm not a conspiracy but who's planning this organization the caravan who's\nPaying for it I sometimes don't Blakely tell me jokes or I mean do we have anybody because I'm I Know I mean I'd be curious by this Roger first off if they don't ... we're told that they got to pay thousands of dollars to the coyote says what the tournaments for the people that get them across okay well if there's new\nJobs down there if there was a wink of how the people getting the money ... ... I don't know\nThat's right thousands of dollars where did you get the money to you and where do you\nGet the money to get on this caravan to cross this ... I get on that conspiracies I'm just asking who is organizing this\nYou know that's that's a real good question I don't know the answer to that but I Wonder whether or not we need to do a better job as far as public relations letting people do in their home countries are about our guest worker program and how to apply right opposed to just ran across the border you just heard that clip that\nThe majority of them out there that the reason I mean are we going to seek asylum but yet the your economic benefit I get that and the question is is what type of economic benefit they looking for exactly you know is the government to come out and do things out there tripled you talk tripled to eight to five five Megan Kelly\nDone gone\nMany people said how come you Roger not talked about this well we had a lot of other issues on friday show as well but I Want to get to it several you've been emailing me hey are you going to talk about Megan Kelly do you really care well let me bring up what CNN course Cuomo said to her about her comments of blackface\nThey answered the question of how a segment on Halloween costumes can go wrong is when you make it about black face being okay here's NBC's Megan Kelly\nIt's really ... you get in trouble if you are white person who puts on or a black person that puts out a way that we have a kid that was okay as long as you address another character I got\nBack in the day when I was a kid it was considered okay oh I'm Sorry I didn't endorse it she said it was considered okay right back in the day\nAnd there are places in New York would land as she got Diana Ross and she made her skin darker than it really is and people say that that was racist and like she wants to look like a an around her one day I I don't know how like that got races on Halloween [noise]\nWhite people putting on black face some blacks who were putting my wife is a very different things right now\nPutting on black face and black and white faces very different things\nAre right now ... some of you out there listening all out huge a black but none of that uh I again I was asking Roger\nWhat was the racist comments that making Kelly made I find it I understand why those in the black community would find it very offensive I I get that I just want to know what was the direct racist comment that making telling me that's all I'm just trying to find out who doesn't love Diana Ross\nYeah ... ... school Clinton I heard his day people dressed up like flavor flight they emulate public enemy and Chuck D and fight the power\nAlright and yet he made like Michael Jackson cannot do that anymore\nJimmy Kimble can do it with ... years ago to try and I mean like\nDialect I mean I mean but Rogers exactly correct the bottom line is is that a look at the bottom line is is that are making Kelly just didn't have earrings DJ good morning you're on WB obey\nMorning Matt how's it going hey what's going on this one pretty good\nMan on the way to work I just called to talk about the care of and then you guys both and making sure everything's so I'm going to hit that first of all as an African American male myself like you said that you don't see that direct\nA racist comment in that it's not so much of the fact is a direct threat to call it a little something called dog with apologies we all know\nWhat you're referring to we all know how she was basically giving up has to people who wear black that you guys may not\nUnderstand the historical significance behind black and white black people find that so offensive but if you open up your mind off of it and it brings more than just the headlines\nI Know I'm just asking you about the history of this I I'm not just a great bodily Rogers black and didn't find it offensive he even said that what I'm saying is is that where it was a direct supposedly going out of her way to become a fence and that's all I'm asking\nThat the the whole conversation what what was the reason for the whole conversation being brought up you know what I mean it's not it's not so the fact that everybody on board the gotcha moment you know what I mean and it's not necessarily like that we live on the times where a man like people are just\nThey are out there about these high hold on hold and go ahead Roger okay that's a DJ\nI get the fact of blackface mints rules that was part of what was done to humiliate why people would mock them in years gone by Dr I tried to look at motive even if someone does that says something that is racially offensive\nI Do do I believe that mainly making Kelly meant to be racially offensive and when she said who doesn't love Diana Ross I really don't believe that she she meant that\nBut when you say if you have to put it in context Megan Kelly what they talking heads for Fox\nNews I I Know it comes out and said things like that yeah I guess it's surprising I really wanted to talk of guy I really want to\nTalk about the care of and mad at somebody on I watch Morning Joe every morning man like fear for there to go to a news source in the morning and um they were very very very I'll just say\nConfused on how all of a sudden his whole chair band aid because they care and has been happening for years it just funny how closer and closer to the election we're hearing more and more about the chairman you brought up who's paying for it when you're asking me honestly I think it's the president of the United states\n[laughter]\nI like to use your money like you know Donald Trump civilians by alone is president of the u._s. history he could write the check

they're leaving and they want to come here and you're saying we want men again we want Medicare [noise]\nI don't know I don't think they're lazy I Know a lot of those that come here to work a lot of them get on work visas have you ever seen news I mean I'm not trying to be stereotype you ever seen those at work like like working at the you know way down hard work\nOut in the hot sun picking strawberries and the ... that is that is some real ...\nSomething about them being lazy ... none of you listening to come across from the Caribbean thirty days away that's not being lazy that's but

twenty nine federal charges eleven counts of using a firearm to commit murder and also\nHate crimes weeks before the shooting Bauer had posted on social media is anti Semitic slurs he's not some say wasn't a big fan of President Trump he says that quote Trump was surrounded by\nToo many Jewish people out there despite the er which took place with the shooting the left continues to wants to blame this on President Trump media buzz Howard Kurtz\nAnd today the Washington Post front page or above the fold headline pointing to this and other recent attacks ice critics are saying the president and he'll be gone beyond partisan political confidence outright demagoguery against racial minorities foreigners and prominent Jewish political figure as my heart absolutely\nBreaks for this tightening Jewish community in Pittsburgh where there's a full shooting took place a place of worship the shooter had a history of anti Semitic social postings are again you know loud to rant and rave\nBut as far as President Trump I mean there were many mass shootings ... bottom was president including the tragedy of the nine African Americans killed in that South Carolina church so from the press perspective it's not like the violence began with the Trump Administration\nAdrian ... former strategic director of communications for Hillary Clinton campaign says yeah still a lot of this blamed got to be but at the feet of Trump\nOn their online for a long time out of Washington going out for a long time that there is an airline threat to the pipe bomb so they said oh today and I hope and pray but I Do a lot of faith regardless of political party however\nFind belly everything that he or she will bring those countries that are and to me the phone from Cairo and trying to\nDo the media is not seeing that from President Trump here's a question I like to ask you those listening if this is based on political rhetoric\nPolitical rhetoric right now Bush over the weekend the n._r._a. was to be blamed for the shooting that took place can somebody I'm just asking the questions you can only tell me what ... just recently came out with none of they've already calling can somebody just weren't can you tell me what recent rhetoric theory used the costs are shooting to the Internet has been very quiet lately\nIt's very common to associate the n._r._a. with any of these mass shootings are interestingly though we have not seen any that I'm aware of where the shooter has ever been in our remember\nYeah so I mean how do they get to be blamed it let me ask you a question when five Dallas police officers Roger\nWere shot in two thousand sixteen by Michael Johnson\nWho love black lives matters he was a big supporter but the new Black Panther party which advocates violence against whites\nAnd Jews um he also was a big defender of Louis Farrakhan nation of Islam I I don't recall people blaming President Trump or five Dallas shootings that took place of cops black lives matter led to protest the media throw them under the bus I'm just kind of curious by that\nIt's it's real difficult to see the connection and the consistent with ah with President Trump and again these mass shootings\nSarah Fisher reporter for Axios as the media has\nTo take responsibility for what it reports\nScientists are going to find the ... again ... ... how but in fact is not what caused this particular he was talking to for about an hour and they need to understand what Trump supporters here when it comes from ... ... troops like by the way which makes them feel that way I could account earlier this year I found out prowling channeling\nTwelve have lost their jobs here get political tweets that were taking one side or not there are a lot of them how to do it by the way the median going overboard about the crisis in San ... accountability for ... living in an environment where it can be difficult\nI mean has anybody seen Jimmy Acosta from CNN get punched out no no we went on nothing happened to have dry he's been all these Trump rallies he heavily criticizes the president no one's taking shots at him\nYou know it's all about when it comes along the latest numbers by these no the latest numbers you just let them know once they've done it they can't do it again okay I'm not even go ahead and tell them right now I'm the latest numbers show according\nI'm not even go ahead and tell them right now I'm the latest numbers show according to the CBS News tracker poll Andrew Gillum is up by one here in the state of Florida override does and just Rick Scott the governor of Florida is tied with US Senator Bill Nelson\nLet me start with a couple of states that I think will tell the story at least early on on election night watching next week the first is Florida and that race we have tied between Rick Scott and the incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson\nScott seems to get a boost from his handling of the recent hurricane there that may be helping him out\nSo the number is tied but yet one of the biggest issues Roger according to Florida poll numbers out there of course is health care and the economy\nGovernor Rick Scott is supporting big big measure when it deals with the issue of Obamacare clip number three\nI went to tell you about a family with the previous health condition public housing rarely saw Dr where the kids into the mom would try to hundred mile charity hospitals are getting treatment\nThat was my family growing up in the morning or seen insurance companies to cover his condition to my\nConservative friends did you hear that\nBut when I support foreseen insurance companies to cover for using conditions you know it's just another political issue\nFor me personally\nI wouldn't mad so the question I like to ask you should insurance companies be forced to carry cover I should say pre existing conditions the Republicans are now supporting us Roger this was a major move major difference with Governor Rick Scott I Do\nNot recall him ever opposing bet a provision of Obamacare in the past repeal and replace was what are you in a very general sense yeah well\nYou repeal the whole thing yeah preexisting conditions so that's the question I like to ask you what about that does that need to happen President Obama was on the campaign trail talking about the Republican and other Republicans but they're the ones ally and they're the ones that make up everything\nHave exaggerated\nNow he has a plan to drive down health care premiums and deductibles wells do covering pre existing conditions ...

really do we really want to go now that we do have a another hour left\nThere could be an argument made that you know your insurance rates won't go up and you can keep your doctor and he really thought that when he said it but I saw something on line where he actually denies that prior to making that statement so unless he got new data and then it turned out to be wrong or\nDo you remember remember last week insurance prices were dropping I don't really talk about a ball is why I don't know where you get that Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail also she was down here with Andrew Gillum over the last few days she says that the country because of you Trump supporters out there that's right you people she says\nNot only is this country confused but you've confuse the rest of the other world\n[noise] honey honey that he want to run again now\n[noise] now ... why well I'd like to be president okay [laughter]\nHopefully when we have a Democrat in the oval office in January of twenty Twenty one [noise]\nThere's so much work to be done to everybody in the world including ourselves and we're confused our friends and our enemies and they have no idea what the United States stands for what we're likely to do what we think it's important uh so\nI just I Do to the to liberals out to listen to the show even to some of you that may not be a big fan of President Trump my question is are you guys shocked when he campaigned about the only use today\nI mean I I'd say the same thing about Obama Obama told you he was a liberal you know he kept ... governors a liberal not shocked by that I'm just saying oh we all shocked\nBy President Trump's actions\nYou know what you have a very good point and he was saying some off the wall stuff during the campaign people were shocked by it and now he's president and he's still got some also offering sometimes\nUse the same argue with Andrew Gillum when he chose a liberal podcast that if police pull out their guns use their ... or their tasers they've actually gone too far in wind or do you think\nThe fact that they think I'm you know Mr break the law and all this other stuff that they say God Knows I don't want to get like two with\nAll the stuff that they say um I've got to let them know and I only know for police accountability\nBut law enforcement society cannot word and quite frankly law enforcement and John Harvey trusting relationship with the community at the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon to a gun to all the time to a taser than they have all ready to go too far by their very presence\nBy the very trust that they are All right\nSo let's say he becomes governor and in his budget he supports I I Am using the hypothetical supports cutting edge daily supports cutting um things to state run divisions has to do with um mostly police okay are we all going to be shocked by that\nAre you I'm just saying I mean are we going to be shocked you know it's amazing when people Roger you and I I get emails I'm appalled at the times union in Jacksonville, Florida state Augustine record ordeal Leno settle Pruitt conservative under the bus and the editorial you don't my responses I'm appalled at your upon what are you expecting you wouldn't expect\nAny issue I mean some emails on this this morning Megan Kelly\nHe's out at NBC shocker\nShe there because Roger probably basically pointed it out because the ratings were low right CNN course Cuomo because Kelly made the comment and again I'm looking for the motive of racism here Kelly made a comic book ... black face I mean you want to honor somebody like Diana Ross and I mean it was okay in ... she endorsed it but\nThey answered the question of how a segment on Halloween costumes can go wrong is when you make it about black face being okay here's NBC's Megan Kelly\n... you get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on the wane or a black person it puts out a way the way that that was okay as long as you address I care\nAbout are you offended by that comment I wasn't offended by it because I didn't see a motive of gain or any type of animosity ridiculed for black people here are more\nControversy on the real housewives of New York with blue and as she is Diana Ross and she made her scandal darker than it really is and people say that that was racist and like she wants to look like they on around her one day I I don't know how like that got raised about Harlow\nI'll listen I knew you know that one of the hottest selling math\nScore I even got what was it Obama bask\nIn two thousand and eight yeah it was almost ... is that mean that I Want to bomb a mascot I'm racism I knew friends I Know my black friends out there that word of mouth war Robbie master supporting Obama and then some of my white friends ... cents Portman Robyn just just just to have chaos at an ... or some Halloween\nI was looking at a documentary on the lake which is used in life and uh back when she was younger she was on the cover of one of these teenage maggots\nHouston's live and back when she was younger she was on the cover of one of these teenage magazines wearing orange lipstick which is common among black girls cry goes generally didn't do that until we the Houston started to now of course\nThe the black face a reference has to do with the minstrel area era and Amos and Andy and how that was humiliating to black people back during that era I think today's generation we're probably not as much about that than the older generation I mean\nDo we have to get rid of Dan Ackroyd character in trading places where he dressed up as a Jamaican black guy I mean does that mean that a ... you know back in high school people use to emulate public enemy flavors play you know what I mean can't do that anymore\nUm uh Eddie Murphy and flood or he he played a Jewish guy in a barbershop 'em up ... ... mother ... movie slobber was ... was the movie Eddie Murphy was coming to America there was it was coming to America\nAnd you don't have always better than I Do it especially the black ones I Know I've just said is it that way why again it if she had I mean again I keep asking a\nQuestion where was that could be a huge audience that's in the black community where is the motive is Roger says we had a caller and I already told you was gonna be guilt by association we had DJ call up and our number two saying which you store for Fox News that we go what was the dog whistle\n... I'm just trying to ask where's the racist that's what I'm just trying to find out where is the racism\nI didn't hear any animosity at our hearts were you when he thinks usage who doesn't love Diana Ross\nI just kind of curious where is the racism triple to talk triple to eight to five five talk radio W.

yeah he's good guy Goodfellow loves to play ball\nYeah it's um [noise] I Am a surface in years and years and it's just so crazy I'm\nOn my I just had horses and it's a it's fun especially some of those um\nWould Sue Ellen was talking about in our little book about high impact versus low impact and the ones that have a a real high angle going down to the water like down there surf so I'd just north of belong to a beach is a really there's a lot of shell\nOr you can get a ... you can get the mole crabs out of their ... and uh that's that's that's a good beach I hear nothing but good report so that\nYeah it's where I've uh I've always used to go down there and being as this or fish or you know not really sure fish in ... park always did in the uh you know in the bay area and that it needs to serve fish out and home surf part of it is that yeah\nI didn't either until I met him and\nAsked the beach in their\n... but ... everywhere man you know whenever I'm used to live on ... because I mean that's you know something you could do for two three hours and then go home and not have another hour and a half worth of work or on the clean up and all that [laughter] you know uh\nIf you get on a Google Earth it always shows the water at low tide uh-huh and if you get in there and look at that bay area and we are talking about yeah\nYou can see where the channels run ... ... when the tide starts dropping all those fish set up there on the sand bars I've got nowhere to go but back on around those channels and there's all place over there on the far side so little hike from those polls\nTo carry all your gear down there but\nIt narrows the the little channel on channel ... and ... you can set their own at low tide at the drop off and just\nGets just about anything you want if you feel the shrimp\nYeah I have tried it not peeling the ... and you don't catch nowhere near as many but if you take that shrimp and peel it throw it like where the scent can get out there you know they ... it just about any fish goes through their pick it up and get away who are right there\nThat's the good thing about shrimp but everything is shrimp so you know when you're when you're out there like that I mean if you throw in like men managed and you know you only got particular fish just going to eat this Mad Men is but\nI'm using that shrimp everything eat shrimp I've been wanting to get back out to visit ... JDs because you know they have this water temperature is dropping and um you know I saw the other day I mean it's it's probably in a week and a half has dropped six or seven degrees\nYeah so I was down below eighty now\nAnd you know tied you can see where I'm at fishing been tailing in there there's a lot of snails\nIn there and ... and there's a lot of ah lately there's been a a grass has grown up along the bank and there's a lot of fiddler crabs up in that crash now where I didn't used to be any is there any grass at all along that\nI Know there was no ... no grass open there in the eighties\nThough and you can go in there as when we went out there and not toss the net um you can see big potholes yeah where are they the fish and been in their tail in there so it's um there's some fish in there\nI used to like get in there on the higher tide you know come in through for Georgian and fish for trout they're on the higher tide and they should be a news time of the year ... I haven't been up there to see\nThere's enough baked for everybody and their fish people\nWell and I think actually only a lot of bay one saw a bunch of this ... leaves at I think you're going to see the by pick up the\nKnow for for all the species like the the founders trout redfish they'll get ... [laughter] yeah because I mean right now there's so much better for them but they yeah and now the one thing I haven't seen is district coming down the river Leno\nAnd um you know we tried\nAgain for the ... I Can't remember I think it was a blast Monday and they're just they're still just so small just wild and so I don't know if they're even going to get any size to him or not this year\nThe brown and see where they're getting their shrimp from the local news somehow I don't mean Mm\nYeah the brown and see where they're getting their shrimp from the local news somehow I don't mean to some of those people were talking about some shrimp the way down south\n'cause ... Saturday ... is that where you got some\n... you know where they got the shrimp primarily over grounds yeah yeah they were I mean uh I Know you get home from browse but I'm Wondering where the shrimp and they ask yeah 'cause those are really nice being around shrimp in\nYeah and and have a nice sized ones like that you know a lot of times when we're winding fishing or ... of course we're breaking and a half or ... break him in three pieces because all you want small piece fish for wedding I mean they get small mouth you know um\nBut yeah they've had some really nice ... shrimp and um I've been enjoying a days but you know as far as getting those but um\nYou know I don't use a lot of dead shrimp and less as Kroger wedding season and stuff like that and you know but um but yeah it's yeah of course that drum now also syndrome rather trout river I let you shrimp but there because for some reason there's drum there like shrimp instead of uh instead of crap\nYeah ... something something big that mud must have been a ... over there we uh we hit the ... south\nOf the full ... oh did you yeah somebody marketed yeah way more heat it down to um yeah there's two drops\nOut there and we found them both they've got nasty gnarly old movies on them at home but he is somebody dropped it and I was like well you know we keyed in the numbers and went right to it um oh well we must be in there I Believe there was a buoy\nAnd he's not a ... it's yeah and they know this\nUh it's crab trip style float but it has been hit by boats as\nOne of them's was only half of the editing to watch that off editor yeah Mm is that it could have cut in half the half moon flu [laughter]\n[noise] but Joe y'all fish that has been very good but we did a un official pages huh usually fish last shrimp\nI Know what we did was a bottom fish was some flounder rigs and I I was about a bottom fishing of ...\nAnd I tried a must spend our bait and they're just kind of probing the area to get an idea and uh it was hanging up on stuff uh I don't know is\nIt the structures sinking into the silt or not but it wasn't too bad we're able to get it I think we get everything back except for the he got he got ... Wang or by adding big\nIsn't hammered ... about pulled a poll out of my hand it was totally unexpected Wyoming went down and I tried to fall back on it and set it and it was\nSaying was that ... with an attitude or\nWhile it stand in line so I did yeah yeah\nYeah down there yeah I mean there's no doubt I could have been a bull red or something like that team had like tackle it was near the end yeah Sam avid Adler Danny inflict fishes sometime you know laugh shrimp over top of that we have the best way you can locate like the\nThe surface you know to see how much water you get it and just kind of drift ... pretty you know ... pretty close to it shallow I mean it should be ... I mean I I ... and blank drum and proud of them\nYou know I got a ten foot a stainless steel chain on my anchor and or I could see the the chain\nTo rope ... on the the rope where the rope couples up to the chain was coming right up to the surface of my anchor was on the bottom\nTo the anchor anchors about you know twenty inches twenty twenty five inches long mhm and then ten foot a chain so it's it's shallow in there so I Will never ... bad\nYeah we're on the left fish and the last of the ... going in there which is usually ...\nList for the room to less of that going to be that that was about as low as it don't get in there yeah normally I mean on an average ... probably yeah do we have had that real managed touch but still um that's good to know that you can go over top of that thing without hitting in a you know I have\nTo worry about that unless you're getting a vote and got off course got way out of the ... is way out of the ... it's hundreds of yards from the channel\nAnd we were in the tide was said it was one point one at low you know there was it was a in between or we just had a thumbnail moon up there or something\nLike that yeah yeah and it wasn't a minus at all so as you can point one I mean that's a foot above normal so you know\nThen then you wind depending on what you wind up doing\nMargot good on the on the scope and see how big the low yeah you could yeah there's plenty of of structure and it could be\nTwo hundred two hundred feet [noise]\nYeah well if you can catch the salinity back that way and more you got a little salt [noise]\nProbably would do pretty good yeah\nThink things will far off as we can have the water normalized again\nYeah I think that the that might have a lot new was down there but um you know because it's got to have plenty of barnacles oysters algae on it now so you know and we really haven't had much rain at all no Nettie we hadn't lately\nGet it but I Do get Thursday night and fry a\nAnd na na na no movement on six and that ... no I didn't even\nThere that um but\nYeah I say you a copy of the side\nOK out at ... ... yeah whatever anyways I forwarded it to you\nYou take to what is it\nOkay yeah 'cause ah okay I ain't got it when did you do that\nJust a little while ago but a a redo it cause I sent it to one year old pictures\nThey need to leave the pier alone because uh it had a piece of the ... of the\n... lodge floating dark from somebody else's dark wedged up underneath of it but you pull that out of there and the and that peer was good to go and that was one of the finest peers obscene\nYeah it was cold out those recorded over all the way to the grass and headed over there and you know he's a fix platform\nOh God [laughter]\nAnd that is FEMA huh\nYeah\nI didn't know they were in a closed in ... to ... the jurisdiction does he need like the\nYeah only if a hurricane damage to intercept another but yeah I'm going to be interested to see that so I could make some phone calls\nIt's yeah the famous because what I tell\nYou what there's hundreds of people that use that here you go through it and\nSay my number six nine nine two to eight five is that the one you ...\nThat we see [noise] the females that are all over the where they are they doing with our period when I was gonna\nSay yeah I get a pet her okay I just didn't mean when you're ready but yeah it\nKnocked me down what I thought because as far as a lot of the older guys can't get out the vote before there\nWas that was a nice peer it's awesome you know I mean I have two big cheese on it\nYeah I haven't been on it but but I fished around it you know not to lures around that time I mean in certain times of year people go out to the end of it and catch black drum of a\nSudden you know some goes the kitchen bull ribs off of the ... around very are you gonna put him to go\nYeah I was talking to the guy's a couple of weeks ago they were tearing up the big reds there you go should I say the big rats were tearing them up yeah [laughter]\nYeah that's that's ... times yeah I mean that though I always\nFelt that appears just a great a great Pyrenees for people to be able to finish

there's been blowing like crazy but um when you plan on getting back out there\nI'm going to try to go Wednesday morning\nOh yeah I think Wednesday supposed to be a lot nicer a you know I think um they're looking at the end of the few minutes yeah either that or south Williams five not just show in here\nThat such nice because I Know it was they was dice once I got to get out of the wind yeah it was nice but I further more what is it a creek if I could stop feeling when and I couldn't catch where I wanted to and I just said no I\nGot my future out and to the house\nWell whenever you get out there just try to you know get those areas that um you know that you can uh that you can get to try to learn as areas because I tell you what\nAnd it's there's nothing like getting up and learn a new areas I mean I always loved that that back I mean that's\nI don't know the fish the new area unless that try to go back through to ... to a garden creek from Chad again but I'm not sure this would do it at low tide um you know my Carolina skiff course it only took about eight inches of water so I so I went all through there but I'm\nI'm not sure this would do that I think I Need about Thirteen inches or so and this but\nHey Robert this ... ... uh\nI was going to add a little too that a while a long time ago I read an article in the magazine that was called the shallow water angler\nWhich they don't have any more and it's called the ... that was called a fish and the tides creeks fish and the ...\nWell if you fish that income and\nYou can they'll fish will follow that income and tired of all the way up into those areas where there is no water ... and then and then if you turn around and finish it back out as it goes back out of that than they follow the water back out is it that Todd water starts to empty out those shallow waters\nAnd that way you won't ever get to be afraid about getting stuck in there OK\nYeah a lot of the smaller creeks like that I don't go in to them on the ... going to\nGo in a moment in ... yeah and that way if you if you hit bottom or something like that and you know five or ten minutes you're floating again and you can see all those ... to the yeah now we let them do it at at the lower tad you know like when you first get in there when you can barely get in there because those fish need less water than what we all do\nThey'll get up in there and I mean I've seen fish for their back out of the water three hundred feet ahead of me where I Can't reach them you know but\nThat kind of breaks yard but still you know sooner or later you can can I get up to ... the\nCreeks are going to end it as the sooner or later you can get up to that area you know\nAnd with your new you can get in there really skinny\nYeah oh yeah yeah I'm I'm

um\nI listen to your show quite a bit I haven't heard this question my niece has gotten into it timeshare she can't afford from all the reading I can glean best option is to attempt to bring it back and failing that\nShe had the option of a judicial\nForeclosure and they had not she will not be liable for\nUm [noise] what is the word charge or a demotion\nYeah they will accept his back you could do you can't beat it back to them without their permission\nRight and they will so they're already saying they won't but interestingly enough it's would appear to be being charged with credit card which seems so they barely really they couldn't qualify for real um they do it appears what they did is they opened a credit card and what they're doing is they place the monthly payment on a credit\nCard so it seems to me it's simply a matter of um once you stop Devon from occurring at that point\n... ... ... you're nice open the credit cards that's how it appears that we don't do well she can counsel to come home she can cancel the card [noise]\nWell yeah and that but we don't default on that card although it is non secured that\nThat's not what you're trying to get Chris tablets credit so you're better off if you can get them to stop the automatic debit from occurring then pay it off [noise] then then you'll have to deal I guess they of course you'll\nBe getting phone calls from a timeshare condo saying hey what happened but at that point well\nYeah but the end result would still be a judgment against or possibly one day\n[noise] yes I agree I I don't know another way for them another option for them they don't they just don't have the money they have shoulder and they do they need to get out of this seems to me [noise]\nI'm In the absence of them agreeing to accept it back in ... in a to eat it back it they're going to force her hand it seems to me the best option do you agree that good do you think I'm doing well or do you\nDo is there anyone she could give it to that would accept it [noise]\nYou know it's it's it's one of the things is\nThe every other year or two week every other year it's way more than they can or they're already underwater they're living in a trailer and um\nYou know [noise] [noise] yeah and you know a lot of companies a lot of these companies advertised that they can get you out of a time share it with a ... not good\nYeah you have to pay pay them and then I you know some some of these ... at least some of these you don't get your they never get you out of it and you just made them money to do basically nothing\nGot thrown out to do that yeah I like\nThrow out there is anybody in the audience who's ever hired one of these timeshare companies to get them out of a timeshare\nLike to throw out there is anybody in the audience who's ever hired one of these timeshare companies to get them out of a time share and more successful I'd love to hear hear about that and they could probably helpful but a lot of other people so we'll give them a free\nCommercial if they like to tell their story about how they got out of a timeshare [noise] so yeah\nBut do you think I'm On the right track there do you what you do you think there's another way to go about it that would be better\n[noise] yeah I Would I Would counsel a credit card and then if she can't pay otherwise she can't pay and she can get the credit card paid off in stop future payments than they have the option of foreclosure and once you get\nIn the foreclosure Modi might be able to they might be willing to accept a deed in lieu of folk closure instead of paying the legal expenses associated with that hit which\nI Would expect because it was like this entire non judicial foreclosure was really created to benefit the timeshare industry because of foreclosure is lengthy and expense and expensive this way it allows them to receive the property back put it back in ... at this time though they just don't seem unwilling to do it I mean they're looking at gift horse in the mouth and of\nCourse while they're still being paid every month and being able to charge a credit card so get rid of the credit card\nOkay but I thought you really they wouldn't even allow you to cancel the credit card it seems like we need to get them to stop the recurring\nWell you know if you're a nice open the credit cards ... any time of course\nEven with money on it and recurring debit occurring\n[noise] cancel it for a future for future payments\nOkay well that's good to know that she would have to suspend any future habits and then agreed to pay the existing and then either leave it open for the purpose of no private overcast what\nI think you can um I think you can stop future payments stop the money for a future payments and then maybe just working on paying it off and then they come out of you and then you can negotiate the a deed in lieu of foreclosure\nThank you so much you know that's all we were rising arbitrator we [noise] you know if you need your printer fixed and they got a call attorney that's what you do\n[noise] All right Robert or Scott I think you bring All right let's go to Robert ...\nYes good morning Joe morning\nA thank you for helping or all of us out here are you do you really do good work I appreciate you very much\n\n[noise] um I don't question the carnival like I said honey I doubt light\nAround south shore [noise] at least they\nKnow if you have a contractual written lease and they're not really in violation of it I think judges for the most part if you take 'em to court and try to make them for some reason and in some marginal reason the judge who would normally side in favor of the tenets\n\nSo you have to have a pretty major major reason they most of the time to a ... ... ... you get the best way to do is just talk to them and ask them if they could have possibly leave early that\nYou want to move back in maybe give them a little break on the rent or something if they would leave early\nSorry I Do hope that helps [noise] All right\nLet's go to a probably should have asked what was the minor thing they violated on the lease to get a better understanding of that but uh let's go to Tom in Sarasota\nHello Hey Tom yes I got a question about ah my mother in law died a couple of weeks ago and she left a channel five thousand dollar insurance policies that well\nAnd I was wondering what is the procedure to [laughter] [noise] [noise]\nWell I have a better fishery or the policy was the estate [noise]\n\nWell that's unfortunate because most times the person that owns a life insurance policy will name a beneficiary and it shouldn't really be their state because that just wars is it through probate\nSo you've got to five\nThousand dollar policies without a beneficiary so you'd have to win without a well you'd have to hire an attorney to uh start the probate proceeding\nSo without a so the mother in law did so was she married [noise]\n[noise]\nOh he passed for okay and how many children did she have\nGreat\nSo typically what has to happen is the three of them are the two of them have to agree upon who would be appointed to personal representative of the state\n[noise] um\nAnd in the personal representative of the state\n[noise] a guy has it's less than Seventy five thousand you might possibly be ... be able to do what's called a summary administration [noise] so is there\nA separate administration's the short form of a probation or any creditors floating around out there\nNow [noise] so it was no creditors uh you probably could do what's called us some reason the destruction probate\n\nSo your your wife is one of the children right\nThat's correct\nSo which she want to be a somebody has to honcho this thing to hire someone to get\nThe proceeding started\nShipping and wanting to do that yeah okay\nWell are you all have an attorney she needs to be evidence they play news attorney she needs to contact that and she has any questions and doesn't have an attorney I'd be glad to answer any questions she might have\nOh I appreciate it like All right thank you\nDon lines are open you know the legal question it's called the radio show today you have a we're about halfway to the show you the toll free\nNumber eight seven seven nine four three nine six seven three and let's go to Stacy in Clearwater\nThey Stacey say that I I wanted to go to my car I'm quite quite certain I my husband and I purchased the property\nBack in August when it comes to like a current and when he purchased car ran down in the previous owner and see how that either rental property we um we get extended originally that the previous owner had like the\n... and early ... they would no longer than good camera thirty first\nUm my question\nNow defining 'cause they're they're building a house and that's what you know why they're staying there right now\nMy question is if they are not ready or able to live out by December thirty first what legal rights dry half to get them out of there with ... with at least saying that it ends December thirty first\nWell you would to communicate with him in ... you're not going to extend the lease if that's what you're not going to do and that night a week you would like to for them to know that ahead of time so they can make arrangements to leave by men and see what kind of response you get if they if they say\nThey're not very cooperative [laughter] they're not very easy for people to deal with and I'm Wondering if I have to force you\nRun into them of course\nOkay how ... in Florida because I knew to Florida and a lot here still employed at um they're like a certain amount of time that I have to fight I mean that really didn't want to have to go to the corner to fair you know there's certain way that I mean if they're like a candidate thirty you\nKnow when I was in them a certified letter\n\nYou know as soon as you can bet you are not going to extend the lease past December thirty first okay\nIn their ... yeah I Would I Would give them a would give them notice even though you might not have to give them those but you know if you want to make it perfectly clear they need to leave by December thirty first put you in a better position if they try to stay\nI got a chance I write thank you for answering my question All right thank you\nAll right let's go to Michael in a ... and\nMarty how are you I'm doing great and you have\nA question of living living trust them and stuff but we have one child [noise] if\nWe were both my wife that we both of 'em are like our house\nWhich you know it's not going to pay for that will be [noise] and then we have three cars there is nothing on [noise] we have to put those into the trust in order for them and my daughter to be able to avoid going to be with that [noise]\nWell automobiles don't necessarily go through probate put your home\nAutomobiles kind of an exception is usually fairly easy to work with for the personal representative of the will to deal with that without going through appropriate process your home your home so it's a it's a regular home and son a mobile home it's a single family home was we have a date\nYet or if I were doing your trust for you I Would have put that into the trust to win the trust is created with what's called the quickly indeed\nAnd there are special language and that has to be in the trust and the deed to preserve the homestead protection\n[noise] so that's not something we can do now\nYes it is yeah the trust is like a bucket the way I like to describe the trust is like a bucket you have the rest of your life to put things in or take things out so quickly indeed can still be done to you trust\nOkay and then our bank accounts and we added her name to all of our bank accounts [noise] so what was going to need to be in a trust it only really\nWell in our in our by adding a name her name to your account\nShe's the co owner and if she were to get to divorce have an accident\nThen her credit or situation could affect your own ship so okay I think that would probably advise against that and put the asset in the trust the bank account and the trust in that way can also be use your benefit if you become incapacitated before death\nAnd you're not subject to your child liability\nChoke you put the ... the ... they have to take her name off and be accounted for we spoke to trust you\nKnow you have to take her name off which is what you should do anyway\n[noise] okay All right well thank you for their nation\nAlready been eating you know the further help but be glad to hear the answer more questions for you or I think you should [noise] excuse me let's go to Dan in Jacksonville\nCan you hear me Joe I can okay or a non family member verbally\n... told me four or five years ago that I listed as a beneficiary in their trust stand or will I'm not one hundred percent sure what the guy how can I find out is sending you know they pass away before I Do that I Am and dean listed as a beneficiary and assuming they have the trust\nWith absolute certainty because there is an obligation on their part financially that they're trying to cover by putting me on there\nAnd was to me as a beneficiary a pass a financial obligation that they held on and so I'm just wondering how ... how do I or anybody for that matter you find out if they're listed as a matter of Fisher I Want somebody passes away\nIf they can agree on things like that then they need in\nEach attorney we should have an attorney that would work that out the easiest least costly mad that of course is to have an agreement between two of them if they can come to that about who gets what and how much and so forth\nIf they can agree then it goes before the court the court basically decides\nOh yeah that's the short term marriage of under seven years\nSo the longer you're married of course the more it becomes a like over Seventeen years is pretty much a fifty fifty right\nDivision but on the three or four year marriage is kind of unknown and the court was going to see the financial affidavits they both sign and make some decisions that they can't do it themselves\nIs there any equity in the home\nUh yeah yeah I'm probably about at this point depending on what it felt for\nProbably thirty or forty thousand dollars\nAnd that's after real estate commissions and all of that\nYeah yeah that's what it should be any way that that's going on from low estimate of property value on home that I never\nWell I shouldn't say around and try to work it out so who do or even if would\nYou be okay with like twenty five percent of the equity\nUm he really just wants to get away from her she cheated on him and so forth and I guess somebody pulled him in Florida I Know in Ohio you can't really get somebody it's just you know you're a what are irreconcilable differences or whatever\nBut you know there was no longer if you have a it's a no fault stay sickly so they have no children yeah\nNo no children\nWell would would she be agreeable if he just signed a deed over to her\nAnd not ask for anything well here comes the trick then he would like to purchased a house\nI see because he's now at school and\nYou know well I don't know how important I don't think the court would grant that so he probably either she agrees that and he agrees to take over the mortgage\nIf they agree to that that might work\nBut if she wants something piece of the equity and then they get that has to be negotiating she'd probably wind up with part of that in any way\nRight right yeah that's what we're trying to figure out so the house with ... with the mortgage company actually be able to transfer the name\nYeah your son was ... when the mortgage yeah your son would apply for the the mortgage\nAnd they can be worked out where she's released if they accept him\n... wouldn't be like going back in and paying them by the house actually you know with all the closing cough and all that kinda stuff correct\nNo just be a transfer to from a hurt him with an arrangement where he's approved in the mortgage and she gets released\nOh that's awesome man yeah that's\nCool because of all I'd much rather mortgages shouldn't be a problem but\nYeah yeah he well so I mean ... to me you know\n... yeah [laughter] I Know\nOh anyway well hey appreciate the time man I I didn't even know your show with on this station I turn the station on every morning when I'm at work and then the garage and I heard it and I'm like man to be a good opportunity I appreciated yeah\nWell I like coming up there once in a while I'll get to calls where I have a reason to come up that way so\nI have an office that I was one of the financial planners I work with has given me a if I had more clients that are my little office up there but I'm\nA love to come up there I've spoken at a couple of churches up that way than invited me to come speak so I'm looking for speaking opportunities in inclined seminary so I can get rolling up there so\nYeah cool and I I Know he'll he will or they will need at least one attorney I Know in Ohio you just need one attorney to a a represent both people wouldn't like it at an all night and stuff like\nThat and you know it's always better to have to go one representing each side but at the bar is getting work everything out that certainly makes it easier and if they work everything out in uh the the one attorney you know like she could wave a right to an attorney\nIf for example we were representing the sun\nSo right okay All right All right we'll sound good we may be in touch with you know banks thank you have a good way to you let's go to leave I in Jacksonville\n[noise] I'm On the question why you're talking about a a ... a semi are only get a thousand or ... or whatever\nThey're even responsible for instance you saw\nThe aerosols for a person I Know my sister or brother or a money but last may and my brother and my other brother a lump sum but he likes to show that you know\nTry to tobacco and are not very ... and the same amount but they she printed it out to I think it's two thousand a month mhm and uh and it's pretty clear thousand that backlash from your brain tissue guys are already or something [noise] uh\nShe she got to go through or\nThat they do at work is that possible for her do that if there was that she she ... she said I Want to\nShare how much you can go to Jay Jay ... or something like that you can get the money came\nTo get the money is in charge of the uh well anybody can contest the clause in the Willard trust those can be very difficult\nAnd so JD which she tried to sell her share\nRight right I mean yeah and I wonder how much how much gas take will take\nWell yeah I'm a trustee would ...\nI guess take take like well I'm a\nWhile because Trump the would have to agree to that in trust you probably wouldn't agree to that so she might be done in the water on that\n[laughter]\nIt wouldn't be able to fight it and help right\nWell they they could but it'd be a big battle and she'd be using it probably her share of the money in the trust to pay for it\n[laughter] so okay there\nAre I Know because I thought that you're crazy\nAnd it it made me now\nAll right now I think you\nKnow senior asking attorney all about Florida law we have about seven minutes left in the show you have time to be a caller at eight\nSeven seven nine four three nine six seven three\nPhone lines are open Neal is good at after Shelley they're open let's go to Shelley in St Pete\n...\nI guess chilies not they're not OK\nOkay so you're listening you ask an attorney all about Florida logging we have time for a few to call in at eight\nSeven seven nine four three nine six seven three that's eight seven seven nine four three nine six seven three phone lines are open be more than glad to try to help you if we can and let's go to Mary in Tampa\nThey marry\nYeah oh yeah yeah I appreciate your being on the closure\nYeah I Want to I Want to put my daughter I'm like what they\nAre so this is your home said ha ha\nWell I Would usually advise against that ...\nThe reason why is she going to live there with you\nYeah uh-huh chicken and I'll be [noise] I I Am there\nWhat's your level of uh certainly knew that she will stay there with you\nOh [laughter]\nThan white man and I'm I'm a ... year though though I mean you know I didn't you\nDo you have other children\nI have a child ... our way out to better on line that out and getting a divide it\nWell I think it'd be better for you to be in full control of the house and you are now so why change that just have a will or trust their leaves it equally two the two of them at the other ones from being receiving an inheritance\nOr who have a a ...\nOh yeah well as the properties and the trust and does it probably leave it to the two of them\n... ...\n... you know I Would stick with that if you put your daughter's name on there that's the gift that means it has to come out of the trust and then if it's if the value of the gift is more than Fifteen thousand you have to deal with give tax return\nOh if you die the property gets who stepped up costs basis if you put her name on there then the the ... year costs spaces gets frozen on her half the amount of what it was a time of death he believe it the way it is it gets to step up costs basis\nAnd generally I Can't think of any good reason to win particularly since you have a trust to put her name on it now\nBecause you need to get out of praise and you have to follow a gift tax return if she would ever go out on their own and doesn't live there then you have a person that's um ... owns half the houses not in title to a homestead exemption on it or so\nThere are lots of reasons why I usually try to talk people out of doing that\nYeah well the fishing gear\nDo do do it we just take it or we do a quick claim deed from you to both of you\nKnow\nAnd that puts her name that puts her name as an owner\nYeah what what\nAre we do a deed like that for a two fifty and let's say two fifty", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh

outpacing Democrats an early absentee now Roger before we go any further just for the audience because don't properly explain this I Will get a boatload of emails a lot of people are asking about the amendments we're going to cover that this week and everything else\nThe Democrats yes percentage wise or it comes to the turnout and voter enthusiasm have and an advantage over the Republican that's the percentage wise when it came out a couple of weeks back as we reported that Florida daily dot com also in his radio show\nThat normally the Republicans out pays the Democrats as far as requesting absentee ballot Ralph requesting\nThat was passed up that was all Democrats surged by about twenty five thousand of those requesting so they showed a heavily turnout much more than Republicans\nAs far as what has been returned now in mail that it's almost about seven hundred thousand ballads currently Republicans about scoring the Democrats forty four percent\nDemocrats at thirty eight ... now that number's been cut it was like nine about six points for Democrats\nHad are trying to cut the lead in there as well so that's pretty much what's going to end up taking place boaters impacted by

Santos and some would say I love it let's get to the clips couple areas where the issue about the environment and water rising levels out there Andrew Gillum says you know what we need we need someone as a governor to look out when it comes to the issue of science\nFor so what Florida voters need to know is that when they elected governor they don't have a governor who believes in science which we have had for quite some time and\nMaybe they need a governor might leave an economics I'm Sorry go ahead\nSay I'm not sure what is so California about believing that the state of Florida out a lead in solar energy I wouldn't know what the sunshine state\nAt the very least what we can do is be a global leader here we've got to see on the forty nine states of what to do and what it means that the state that quite frankly leans into the challenges of the green economy and bills one and at the same time bills and economy that last\nCan I ask you a question what does he mean by the challenges of the green economy we tried there's ten years ago with Charlie Crist we try to do with the Obama presidency or don't you lived market forces dictated they want to go down that road inside the government trying to push it\nYou know what there's a lot of government intervention with a lot of different things and I guess this is something he obviously thinks government still needs to continue to be involved with to see happen you know this being the quote sunshine state let's\nKick it off a lot of issues with the gubernatorial debate which is another one will take place I think Wednesday evening down in South Florida but the issue of race came up like we were shocked\nSummer again to the Congress men they let us know exactly where he was going to take this race that day after he won the nomination the monkey a comment that at all and he is only continued and the course of his campaign to draw all the attention he can\nOr to the color of my hand and the truth is is you know what I'm black I've been to like all my life so far as I Know that line\nBut this is the point that the only color that the people at the state of Florida care about is the blue green algae flowing out of the ... you\nKnow that Elizabeth Warren cannot say that street just say I was born Cherokee I Will die Cherokee spent all my life and I was a high chair of the\nColor that the people of the state of Florida care about is the blue green algae flowing out of the east and the west side of the state and they deserve a governor who is going to protect the environment after Twenty years that we're not going to protect a day off to the area and\nI Wish I could do the fact checked I wished CNN would contract with me you and I both go I've gone to see Annette I'm just I'm like well I Wish they would contract that first of all the color a state of Florida cares about\nIs green green I thought he was going to save it and he talked about algae upset by the way he's\nGoing to need all the great for all that for all the spending he wants to do first off you know we had the science or was it a Peter Braley who's been a scientist\nWho graduated from Florida tack he's an environmental scientist who covered both sides last week and he pointed out that the red tide mixed up with some of the pollution does have a major effect but he says a lot of that combined the red tide ... we we can't prove for years whether or not this is manmade right\nRight it is if anything make say the ... the people fertilizing their lawn may have a big effect on that as well and it's All right you know it's hard to say\nOf the people fertilizing their lawn may have a big effect on that as well and it's All right\nYou know it's hard to do so by the way so he talked about the issue of race again\nLet us go back the day after the election of the primaries is is what Ron just Santa ...\nElections are always competitive and um you know this is a guy who although he's much to to wherever all for Florida I think he's got a huge problems with how he's governed Tallahassee a you know here's an articulate spokesmen for those far less views and he's a charismatic candidate and you know I watch those democratic debate none of that it was my cup of tea\nBut I mean he performed better than the other people there so so we've got to work hard to make sure that we continue Florida going in a good direction let's build off the successfully pat and Governor Scott the last thing we need to do is to monkey this out by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state\nIf Trump\nThis country whoever is such a bunch of racist but are these people want to come in this country and I do a good point because I just want to ask the question\nComes out of economic socioeconomic desperation which people from countries that you know the movie economies are horrible and they're living in poverty we see no future they want to be a part of the American dream sometimes if your neighbor moves out and the the used abandoned home of the other side of you to keep your value up you've got to go and look I wouldn't\nJust agree with that do you know there's some people in American Dream of those that live in America is going to the government do ... see American Dream the media being accused I mean Republicans everybody says that Trump is\nAngering up his base to get his base to come out there in support but here's the discussion between media buzz Howard Kurtz and senior editor for the federalist Mollie Hemingway says you know what a Trump may be doing it but so is the media\nOnly been a major media fame president and whipping up as a base over cap in order to get Republican voters to turn out all these liberal columnist are openly and these are not dog whistles opening doing the same thing on the left\nAnd we may wish that people want to vote by anger anger is a very very common way for people to decide who to vote\nFor that to exactly correct ... this is what Kurtz had said about the media and the op ed telling people just get out there and vote especially for those have you on the left as media buzz\nAbout president from using the brutal Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to making conservative supporters angry but their op ed pages are preaching a rather different measures take a look\nCharles Blow in New York Times liberals this is war David Lee in our New York times get angry and get involved his lean if you're not anywhere yet you shouldn't be he's your ideal Washington Post when to stay angry on Kavanaugh\nSo aren't there are two sides to the use of anger and fear in the mid term now\nHe's talking about two sides are you've got the Trump but also what\nDo you know rally not the Democrats they claim it's it's the media\nWasn't let's be on a lot of Republicans were angry after the vote with Obamacare two thousand to innovate march or April that year they came out and member Obama and other Democrats sat back and said they're cutting away your health care pre existing conditions that is to anger at the base there's anger meant on both sides you act like it comes from one side is just absolutely hypocritical\nExactly and I think it was coming from the media at least they're being taught us to stop you know op ed pieces that opinion piece and there are giving their opinions to people who write these articles so you know whether or not work with little or speaking to anybody who would vote any way ah otherwise is is up for discussion\nLosing the Julian Turner a Fox News correspondent who worked in both at the age W excuse me the WWE and the Obama White house she says when you listen to the media she says it's like they're trying to advance their own strategy to get people out and vote\nCome back to them of course we let me ask you first joined the politics of anger and fear and campaigns have basically been around forever in the history of the country but shouldn't depress report and or call out both sides equally if it's happening on the left as well as the right yeah of\nCourse they shut and that's part of the responsibility I'd actually go one step further that not only on less than I Would say that\nRiling up people is\nActually the only way to get Americans to vote particularly in terms and sells for ... stay home yeah what we I mean that the turnout is horrendous fright so this is the moment\nYou know get people angry [laughter] this is I think this is the mainstream media and most of which is left leaning doing their part to get out the vote in the ... it's almost like they've got their own electoral strategy going\nOut and and I think this is nothing new Roger and the anger my ... I mean whether it's on an issue and by the way it just doesn't happen from a national stayed happens here in Florida people sit back and say hey I don't want my taxes being raised here I don't know I mean I mean you could call it anger but it happens right\nRights Jenna got people with respect to you know trying to get them mad to get out and vote if it really is a form of manipulation and unfortunately I think it happens on both\nSides when it came to the issue of guns in the debate between Andrew Gillum and the Democrats the mayor of Tallahassee and former Congressman Ryan to St just the Republican nominee a little bit of the debate that took place Sunday night had to do with the issue of guns Galen says hey dissenters painting\nBought for by the n._r._a. while I took them on the congressman was against the piece of legislation because he his old wholly owned by the n._r._a. or he's not going to stand up to the national\nHe owned by the n._r._a. or he's not going to stand up to the national Rifle Association that's why they're running all these ads against me because they want the man that they bought\nA in my case we're prepared to stand up to the in our actual demanded they bought was that I'm putting them but that's okay and they sued me they drew me to court for two years all because we said we would not allow guns to be shot in a city park here we go again radical\nThat you cannot shoot guns in a park for our kids play in our family picnic that's why people are so incensed by their step because common sense and decency seem not to be able to prevail in this\nCompany ... again folks what he's not telling you is there was an already law in the book you got places like Whitcomb park in Melbourne, Florida you got state parks throughout the area that are miles long and there's a park or on the other side kids can swim and in other areas they're very confined area what you can and cannot shoot\nThat's what he's not telling you number one number two the law and some people were stating that you should be able to help poor concealed weapons permit holders\nIn case something goes south but we do that title above it and was July or August when they wanted to have a there was a rally I guess or at a gathering for people to sign up\nTo go to school and back to school sales holidays we're an individual with a concealed weapons permit was able to stop somebody else you wanted to do harm to other individuals their throughout this is what the mayor is not telling you it's not like Roger is going to hang out with a picnic with his daughters federal local park and I'm from five feet away I see a a goose ... want to shoot it\nActually is an interesting thing though those who are not aware of that detail a will assume that the governor was ... at least the ... the candidate for governor of the Democrats I was actually you know doing something that seems reasonable enlist you hear the explanation\nHairs dissenters versus Gail among the highest rate of murders in Florida and is being\nDone uh and that's Donald Trump or neglecting all sensory than in fact\nUh I ... a city that has experience in a five year low in our crime rate on trajectory to be at a twenty year low and our crime rate no matter a brief statement that what do you have to say you're going to change the fact that the CNN or Fox you have to bring fact that the commerce area for now our case so\nThe same just keeps going record number of murders last year yesterday Gillum won't answer it\nWe are the largest city in our twenties type of thing crime ... this is what I thought about it on our different than what Florida voters understand is\nThat communities will experience crime a shift in Jacksonville earlier today facts to fix people's shot I bet you of Maryland according was less than as he's like well I had to bring me and that's the question is what are we going to do about it and what I'm going to do is take on the n._r._a. and hold them responsible for the rent and crime and I I Want to add\nBy the way it does have the record number of murders\nIn the state of Florida that is documented that document will cover this more as we continue to move along\nTripled you talk tripled to eight to five five did you watch the debate last night when it was your take about what do you think I'm kinda I'm kinda curious to hear from you it was there a winner from the debate last night one issue was the winner for either Gillum indoor\nFor dissent is tripled to talk\nNine zero for triple to eight to ... talk radio W.

network ed Lynch who is blogging all last night that the Gillum probably won the debate but he says he did it because he lived through his teeth well [laughter]\nIt's going to be good always coming up I always love to hear from you at nine zero for triple to talk what'd you think about the debate last night Gillum dissenters who won and what issues where they're strong or weak for coming up next talk radio WB obey\n[noise]\nThis is what Gillum said now folks that maybe a little bit ... done it this was what Gillum said about defending his tax proposals listening closely\nWhat we're proposing so let's be clear one there is not a state income tax here in the state of Florida I'm not proposing one in the state of Florida Ninety seven percent of businesses don't pay any taxes at all\nOkay now first off that semi trip but let's go along with the argument about needing money to support all of his wants and needs here we go\nIn a state of Florida Ninety seven percent of businesses don't pay any taxes at all I'm not proposing to change that our proposal is is that for the three percent of the wealthiest corporations in this day three percent\nOf the try the Trump tax scam supported by my colleague here I walked away with six point three billion dollars of our money working people's money\nAlways saying that corporations can keep five point three billion but we're going to take a billion of that and invest in public education\nOkay so here's what he's not talking about Roger okay so you saw all these companies make billions off of Floridians\nWill yeah and that's part of business I mean\nSomebody ever asked the question how much is government and maybe how much is government make all the taxpayers when it comes to their business\nReally refer to you know the profits you were making a tax taken away it's our money [laughter] straight headsets or method me up tonight [laughter] but anyways\nThe so this is what he said but Roger this is what I keep asking\nThe question he wants to raise a billion dollars\nTo tax the so let's say he could raise it okay fine let's say you can do with the money by raising forty percent tax on three percent of all the businesses out there now folks\nNow the last going to sit back and say it was three percent can I ask you a question you live in the city of Melbourne, Florida you live in a small city bureau beach let's say you live in Jacksonville I'm a saint Augustine\nRoger ... percent of your businesses are going to be hit with higher taxes here's the question what a three percent of the businesses getting hit employ a lot of the companies out there and they sit back and say we can take it hit you they local mayors Democrats or Republicans would go along with that no they don't have we may have\nTo move out of the area for lower taxes yeah so that that's the other question that it happens right but here's the other question I Would ask real quick and I want to listen from the audience\nIs that he wants to raise a billion alone when he didn't talk about what would you wanna get into is the Medicaid expansion he hasn't talked about how he's going to find that all the environmental issues as well he hasn't talked about how he's going to pay for the minimum wage\nAnd the sand is they didn't question him about that I mean he was doing all this dirty or certainly isn't me yeah [laughter] but I mean I I Know to the other debates kind of come up Wednesday and I hope\nThey talking about the economic issues we are going to get more this year and just a little bit but I mean you know the bottom line is that if it's Ninety seven percent of the companies out there don't pay taxes and the folks that are on they do pay taxes taxes or in other areas they paid they do have to pay a business\nTax locally in state why they have to pay their taxes as well so he's not giving you the full details of what's going on and yet we continue to cover this more as we continue move along alright tripled to talk [noise] tripled to eight to\nFive five let's go to um go to Jim Jim good morning you're on WB obey\nThe morning at how you doing today what's happened in the morning or\nOr what about the the national debt and all the Democrats are lower than the Laffer curve\nOf tax revenue or we are getting more tax revenue and now that we did during the Obama years correct that showed that it has nothing to do with letting people up there that says keep the river\nRight now I'm sure there's still some policies because the Obama\nAdministration that are still there but that doesn't change the fact that a majority or the Baker could up for this is you know it's Congress it's true or anything\nOr perhaps pushing build back trucks out saying if you don't get me a budget that cutting spending that I'm not going to scientists\nFor not doing that needs to do that occasionally be that the head of us and it does not you know or or we're going to keep getting higher taxes are going to keep recording and or or see are are perfectly good\nGym you know one thing that I I I like what you had to say you didn't say here and go Trump's ... not use that back and said hey listen I mean he needs to do a better job of Europe a fair criticism of the president very fair criticism when it comes to the issue of the Republican here's a quick question\nI have many of those that listen to this radio show that again everything under the sun we blame Obama and you know we're not big Obama fan having said that\nIs that well no no Jim we had to increase the military by two hundred billion up at one point three trillion dollar so that means\nWhat happened to the other children when you hear people say Jim we we we had to take care of the people at the people who may port intend to all and ... and those that are in other ah MacDill how do you how do you defend that Jim do they have a point by saying we had to increase the debt and deficit for military families\nI don't know that the top that that's the that's the right side of the aisle say where we are we going up but it's it's not it's incredibly programs two thirds of a budget if you're caught up in ...\nWhere there are a a a liability

Gillum had better fool Windsor of even though he might have been making it up on his ... exactly I think he came across you know more in command\nAnd uh as issues aside and then the ... who would think a lot of people would think that as well below ... so he wants\nOne of the big issues of course was Medicaid expansion here's how Andrew Gillum explained his ... Senate\nBetter health to pass a Medicaid expansion in this state or by thirty nine to one and the Florida Senate under Republican control of an effort that my opponent oppose is a ...\nBy the way he does have a point the Republican Senate voted in favor of Obamacare expansion through Medicaid expansion here on the state of Florida films exactly correct\nWe expand Medicaid here in the state of Florida we will a fin access to health care for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy Floridians eight hundred thousand and by doing say will be able to pull down six billion dollars from the federal government\nUm man we could spend an hour breaking this down where he's someone said Roger he's not telling the whole truth\nThat right now is being given away to other things because we philosophically disagree with\nBullets remind everybody this is part of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion the first three years the government according to the to what was happening under Obamacare which is still around the feds pay Ninety two percent of the cost\nOkay excuse me for three years it's free okay supposedly after that the pets pay Ninety two percent of the costs but folks when does the feds really pay for certain things like the border ask\nCalifornia would have done the state run Medicaid because of illegal aliens the folks Amos and Andrew Gillum brings a great point Ron disdain just brings up a valid point they'll set which a promise to take care through federal intervention of all the water problems in South Florida so my question is on the Medicaid expansion you do know that twenty eight thirty billion someone can just find the cost\nWe've had you had that water Jimmy former CFO Jim ie patrolling the CFO says that a good quarter the budgets on health care and the state of Florida so after three years floors can pick up another eight to ten percent of how much money all the feds\nCome in and say a couple of years later Roger doesn't matter who's president and we catch now it's going to be we can only four eighty five percent now that eight to nine ten percent now because of the Fifteen Percent which means you can look at your taxes being raised when it comes to Medicaid expansion Florida here's more what Gillum explained\nTo getting phone access to health care or their hospitals to walk this they're doctors or nurses association\nFor all of course the hospital's water because the pets are going to pay for it\nWe can build photos economies simply by extending access to health care and guess what it\nWhile so what we can build Florida's economy through more government programs that's basically what he said\nIt's not only good for those uh eight hundred thousand people who will get access it's also good for folks like me and for small businesses are right now I Can't afford to get access to health care because quite frankly it's too expensive and out and reach\nI'm there wasn't going to be a series of repeated tax increases but he had called for now he didn't sound great saying yes let's raise the the corporate taxes but for round as soon as his repeatedly charge it there'll be other tax hikes and I thought that a good job\nOf beating that attack back\n... ... ... but didn't numbers do show and then when it comes to release murders over the last few years even last year Tallahassee was the main ringleader um for the cities in the state of Florida\nCorrect and and and for him to ignite a while he didn't exactly acknowledge that uh he did use\nOr his other statistics to say that crime is going down and it has but Tallahassee is still very very dangerous place and you know murders murders were up last year we had the the daughter of an Orlando city commissioner\nWas murdered last year in Tallahassee so I mean it's definitely something that has a hit home in that case has not been solved yet either here's I might mention\nHere's one Gillum said about the issues of guns in Florida clip number\nTwo the congressman was against the piece of legislation because he his old wholly owned by the n._r._a. or he's not going to stand up to the national Rifle Association that's why they're running all these ads against me because they want the man that they bought\nA in my case we're prepared to stand up for the n._r._a. they sued me they drew me to court for two years all because we said we would not allow guns to be shot in a city park\nRadical that you cannot shoot guns in a park for our kids play in our family picnic that's why people are so incensed by their step because common sense and decency seem not to be able to\nYou know I could spend an hour I mean not an out what they're talking about here my and I think you've covered this I mean there's it goes well beyond you know you got big you got big ah parks in central Florida\nMiles upon miles long where kids can go swimming in a pond in about a mile away there was a gun range inside of a heavy area that's heavily barriers and everything else and is that mighty I've already got some but thank you know take more thank you so anyways and\nAnd and what are you saying this is all the n._r._a. wanted to have guns like Mike if you and your family wanted that means I could tell them I with my four ten of golden guy tried to shoot a squirrel going up a tree in the city park that is just absurd\nTo and if you but if you wanted to to carry a weapon in part to protect you and your family mean wouldn't that wouldn't wouldn't that be the same\nThing yes agreement necessarily to shoot it but\nI mean that's what that's what Andrew Gillum was talking about stopping there\nIs you having the ability to protect your family so um you know nobody's winning on the n._r._a. issue I mean people are back in to their corners\nOn the n._r._a. one way or the or whether they want to take your guns away or whether they want to hold onto their guns very tightly that issue is not moving voters in a large direction what is moving voters and what I thought was by far Rhonda ... best moment of the night\nWas talking about this Medicare for all\nA expansion that Andrew Gillum was talked about how it would take away your current health insurance\nIf your employees if you're on Medicare currently if you're in the military currently a just a just he talked about a large majority of the people losing their current health insurance and I thought that was by far run a fan of his most effective most\nOkay my son and former chief political correspondent for Fox News out of Orlando he is the senior political reporter one of the best for Florida daily dot com again if Florida daily dot com where was the Santa is or if he was strong overall ... was there any weak points\n[laughter] well I mean I certainly think that the if you were watching it on television\nSomebody's got to stop him from smearing and making those looks on his face because the camera is always on them and I don't think it it quits will ask for him to be making the faces are doing the laughing ... and in some cases the interruptions were effective\nBut but probably less interruptions but definitely the facial expressions I thought her run to finish the they didn't make him look gubernatorial if you will\nHere's a little bit on the um uh this whole conversation about the FBI let me play a little clip about this about whether uh whether or not any of ah Gillum buddies are being investigated clip number fourteen view\nA start with you a merry go on the FBI has been investigating potential corruption in Tallahassee now for three years the probe appears to include lobbyists\nAnd former a campaign ... refer you Adam Corey even trying to distance yourself from Korea but you've been friends with him for more than a decade and two trips he took together are part of the investigation how clean can Floridians trust his judgment when someone under FBI investigation was part of your inner circle\nYeah well you know we all have friends that sometimes let us down and ah the truth is is let me be very clear about what the record is a I Am not under FBI investigation and neither neither is my city government and what we\nThe FBI investigation and neither neither is my city government and what we have done is we welcome the man if there is someone who has done something wrong they ought to be held fully accountable for their actions we made every public record available on a publicly searchable website and our city a contrast how I dealt with the FBI\nBy All right so Mike without getting I mean you can if you want ... what is this story I mean about traps about weather out there we continue redevelopment agency campaign donors were given favors by government money I mean Mike you you've covered that story report before anything new about this whole FBI investigation and to Andrew Gillum\nYou know I think it was all the same territory but uh I think that you're going the way round the Santa demanded the receipts with sort of the right way to go or taking the ... you know who paid who who pay to get you into Hamilton I think was was ineffective line of attack I also thought the Gillum did a good job countering\nLet's run to finish this travel records but but what's going on here is this\nCommunity redevelopment agencies are in the center of most city yeah and their their own little tax school and they're a cesspool not just the tax bill um give a ways\nTo developers and the government I mean just anti business large and small and a ... and to other companies that do contract with governments consultants across the across the way so you know the FBI is in there to say can we get them to illegally give us some of this money\nAnd uh I mean that's as far as I'm concerned I mean it looks like it's ... ... and he said not sound that the government itself but I mean I'm not convinced of that I'm not convinced that there aren't members inside of the government of Tallahassee that wind up guided out of this investigation\nMike I could ask you an important question I think this would favor the Republicans excluding Tallahassee but the storm reports that are sitting back the secretary of state says are trying to make everything much smoother they're going to keep early voting\nOpen longer all the way up to election day a lot of those votes are assuming when you look at the track record would vote for the Republican even the north Florida Democrats you've covered this\nUh exclude Tallahassee for a second uh it does is disparage a lot of the veterans out there because of what happened with hurricane Michael\nCan they make up those voters this bad news for the Republicans have been a lot of those people are still kind of out of place\nYeah I think it's bad news for the Republicans if you you know if you look at the number of people that are just this place right now and it's not a large percentage of the overall vote but it's a it's a Republican stronghold where now people are saying you know do I have time for that do have concern about that when I don't have power would I don't have a home\nOr when I'm going to be away for a couple of weeks how do I like I didn't ask for an absentee ballot 'cause I plan on voting on a ledge and it's right so now what do I do um so I think it does benefit the Democrats and the Republicans are gonna have to work to overcome it\nBut again it's not a large percentage of the little boat it's just a place where Republicans had already counted on racking up big margins so they've got to figure out can they figure out how to get some of these people back in interest it again and and do they have the time and and mechanism with which to vote\nSenior political reporter for Florida daily down combat Florida daily dot

B. B.\nLet's get to it a lot of people want to comment on ... and just sent to get into all that in a little bit but I Want to honor newsmakers line at lunch political columnist and commentator a manager tells it the way it is entertaining what the Florida\nRadio network so this debate it took Sunday night between Andrew Gillum Enron disadvantages um as you say Gillum won the debate but there's a catch to it and what is an ad\nOr kill 'em one and then he's brilliant at just staring at the camera looking dead pan right in the eyes and wind through his teeth but he was so convincing at it that there's no doubt\nIf you're ... you're wrong supporter you absolutely wrong on you the best he could\nThis debate with not for you if your Gillum supporter while you were voting for many ways the date was not for you this debate for all of that sick offense who have no clue what they're doing when it comes to voting on all these amendments that we have here in Florida and I'll tell you what the other one was the most convincing if you have no clue that he was like\nWell I was um we're as Ron his strongest off work at the Gillum where it was Ron his what feature what she was more powerful on\nHe likes Trump I mean he finally came back the trumpet embrace them I mean that literally he told the truth but he couldn't he couldn't really explain what it was raining\n... matter in order to convince people that he was telling the truth I mean he made about climate change these right about the taxes he's right about the crime rate to ... when he was convincing\nWhere it was convincing on every lie that he\nGave me an issue I have my own here give me an issue and maybe we'll see something different Wednesday night's debate that a deal on ... was the strongest aren't they just said to shoot him knock it out of the ballpark but he did not what what topic\nWell I mean obviously there on on taxes or climate control on the crime rate I mean you know and and we're dealing with the most strong absolutely\nKnocked out of the park was on health care\nWhere he was you know talking at the heart strains of they're already in public saying look we want to make sure that their preexisting conditions will not prohibit you and your family from getting the treatment that you need we're going to make you got no way to pay for this\nWell that's not true he wants to raise everyone tax everyone that this through the roof forty percent additional on businesses Florida start as state income tax I mean that that several times I think four times while he was there\nWell here's what let's play a little clip from Sunday night here was Andrew Gillum on his Medicaid expansion in Florida to\nHelp to pass a Medicaid expansion in this state or by thirty nine to one in the Florida Senate under Republican control\nOf an effort that my opponent oppose this\nOr if we expand Medicaid given the state of Florida we will a sin access to health care for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy Floridians eight hundred thousand and by doing state will be able to pull down six billion dollars from the federal government\nThat right now is being given away to other things because we philosophically disagree with uh getting access to health care\nYou know it kind of interesting he made the point where he says the majority of Republicans a few years back in the state Senate and not the Democrat the Republican controlled on state Senate\nHeavily overwhelmingly supported Medicaid expansion in this state and idea to Braga Obama wanted to push through and many other states and let me tell you something that he goes down that road and set up a little bit I think that can be damaging to the same just brand\nOh absolutely but let's look at Medicaid expansion needy people\nThe only people who are already getting medicate so line number one\nNumber two well you know what six million dollars that would come in from the federal government medicate it's funded by the part of the federal government or by the state government it's basically a fifty fifty match so when we're talking about six\nBillion dollars coming in from the government that because that ... billion dollar filming it from the state I mean this guy lie after lie after lie\nBut he wrapped up in such a little cat it with a beautiful little on it and then at the very end which is grandma that would come out and and knowing him with old is he ran out of there are only he could do and get an opportunity\nWe're in or out only said he couldn't get an opportunity at like I mean the guy was brilliant last night\nIn his ability July directly to the older faces and those are the people that will be in all the people that are mad at me for saying that this law shut up get out there and understand the rest of the world of this yeah\nYeah I gotta tell ya I got a lot of listeners ed that I mean you know you you know what I mean for you they they're they're telling me all once these debates go through Ron's gonna be a Gillum out there at least you got a million votes already cast it probably\nAnd let me tell you a million you got four hundred thousand people displaced because of hurricane Michael and remember Rick Scott one in two thousand ten and two thousand fourteen over very popular ah Democrats white on Seventy thousand vets that up there to turn around election in favor possibly of Andrew Gillum if they don't vote\nAbsolutely and that's why you know my big emphasis all the people that are mad at me for telling the truth about the debate I'm telling you the truth because I don't have to reach ... supporters\nShip if that's going to the polls already they voted already and everything else I'm telling you the truth because if you don't get other people to go out and vote for Ron ... is going to lose\nAll right ed land from the Florida radio network good to talk to you today\nOh absolutely have a great day it's going to be a fun and exciting\nTwo weeks [laughter] yeah [laughter] very well put you know I've I've I've got to agree with that I Can't say this year with anything you said the so I think ... amazing job but the debate was first performance he's so optimistic and get\nYour insurance through your employer abolish is that any thumbs all those people against their will regardless of what they want to stay in their current plan it dumps them on a single payer government system\nThat's around the San just talking about the proposal the Medicare for all by that of Andrew Gillum I'm Andrew Gillum also a little bit further to talk about the reason why we need Medicaid expansion folks\nListen wow listen to how we explain to hell with a boost up the economy\nThousand and by doing that will be able to pull down six billion dollars from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states because we\nPhilosophically disagree with uh getting access to health care of their hospitals to walk this they're doctors or nurses association we can do for the economy simply by extending access to health care and guess what it's not only good\nThese people are communist [laughter] the understand they want to destroy your way of life now get on the winning team and vote read\nOr you go ... ... is your child is going to be working for the scientists can't blame and maybe some so let's go to David David good morning or W. B. up and get off the couch I Love it David good morning\nYeah how are you in the morning and I\nI mentioned before that I Believe that Trump is organized crime and anybody that kisses up to him is going to be organized crime as well so um the or for that last caller given orders that I'd better obey and and the vote for reds but\nThis is not a game organized crime should that be running the FBI organized crime should that be running the military organized crime shows kiss up to take king's\nNow we're going to your mind is Hassan ... the organized crime is looking to go after Trump with impeachment what are you talking about\nUh\nThe FBI Romney on the east side of the runner up\nWhat are you saying\nTrump is not a fan of the FBI\n\nOr courses nod he's trying to stack the deck and he's trying to get up the eye people fired so he can stack the deck with organized\nCrime okay we just had a few moments ago that that did that the that the Trump Administration was running the FBI the organized crime was running that\nA little I didn't say\nThat I heard that a correct that came to mind is\nHe he does not he does not you know the FBI would love to excuse me organized crime would love to to ruin the FBI right you organized crime would love to run banking organized crime already runs hazardous waste dumps\nHim already running up to the ...\nWhat's the difference we'd organized crime and whether it's a Republican or Democrat let me just ... to make it fair what's the difference between organized crime and the government\nWell when you're trying to say that organized crime as political like Democrat or Republican no organized crime\nOut for the money for the money out for the power\nThere to you know they'll put a funny name in front of themselves or you know I had a grandfather that was a Republican my mother's or a Democrat I personally am Green Party ah I Try to stay scientific\nYou know I don't try to pay attention to fake economic standards that organized ... have you ever read those biographies a judge or Hoover yeah\nIn in the ones that came out in the Nineteen nineties the early nineties they described it ate Jagger who\nCame out in the Nineteen nineties the early nineties they described it ate Jagger Hoover and he was the head of the FBI he discovers that organized crime is buying into Wall Street\nThey're buying shares in Wall Street to the extent of two and a half percent per year they're buying two and a half percent at Wall Street per year in ten years turn that would add up to two twenty five percent\nAnd by the way the FBI got into bed with organized crime we've read about that as well but he'll ask a quick what you're talking about the the the the ... I I don't want to put words in your mouth you talked about economics what is what is wrong with the economics today organized crime with the economy I'm trying to follow you on that\nWhat's wrong with it nothing would be true\n... what do we have to take numbers out there with the economy\nWell did you ever study what happened with Enron yeah Enron was using a company called Arthur Andersen which was totally fully right only phony they ... they and Arthur Andersen they've gotten so big and so powerful that they were managing\nAgain that but what is the ... I went up only what what is the fake economic numbers now\nWho's Enron even Noel\nIt it just comes down to the governor's race all the do the governors or near the governor candidates believe and do they believe in global warming and are they worried a jump start budgeting money toward shelters\nToward highways that are not going to be washed out a bridges or they\nHave a new set of Hank said to have a lot of rise level also in the city of Miami I but I'm trying to get back to the economic numbers here I'm trying to find where these fake and I was going on\nThat's that's what I'm saying if these guys don't believe in global warming then they're going to give us fake numbers to keep their their\nFaith ... by the front of economic numbers stuff where you keep saying if I'm just trying to ask what are these fade economic numbers you mentioned\nWell for example if the costs to repair and moves after every year is going to be magnified every year then you'd better have some solid numbers if you're going to pretend that global warming is not happening I end up with\nAn entertainment the environment taco ... is the GDP fake or the tax cuts Vegas spending the stimulus I mean that's what I'm trying to get to when you talk about the economic numbers\nWell yeah the obviously the tax break is a fake uh because most of these uh you you learn about what colony\nEconomics was in Seventeen Seventy six where the king was sucking all the money out of America and it was going straight to London when you were all was being starved back here\nSo the American revolution Seventeen Seventy six was based on the idea that we didn't want foreign powers looting us since suck it all the money back to their headquarters no organized crime is basically doing that\nI listen to Kelly I'm trying man\nI listen to guy sounds very polite I'm trying to keep up here we talk about the economic numbers but then we're going off the global warming I ask\nAbout taking 'em numbers now have you with the governor's race in global I'm just I'm just asking guys just please just stand point here the king of England in Seventeen Seventy six I asked about the current economic numbers right now\nHe's conservative said that the economic numbers were fake under Obama I always ask me tell me what numbers aren't adding up the same question I'm asking with Trump if you're making the accusation didn't tell me what numbers are adding up out there\nBecause even the Democrats admitted the economic numbers are good but they just say it's not doing overall for everybody and this guy's Green Party guy should ask my dislike about the Democrats your calls a more coming up next on TALK radio W.

B. O. B.\nContact and being shown on AM six hundred and one on one of them are going to to to to to to find my email and you know quite how\nPresident wants to make the point that the economy is doing extremely well and that really fine performance of the economy is not being covered by the establishment the conventional media yeah by the way\nThose numbers were fake I'm telling you the media would cover that if somebody was Enron in the numbers and pleading the numbers in case he good morning you're on WB or be\nA good morning how are you doing hey good morning\nSo two items are within the last guy he kept asking about the numbers era where whether that numbers add up to numbers have an added up in this country a long time to take a look at our national debt every number we put together some track something so they can fudge the numbers all they want this country has a massive debt\nWhich is not being addressed that like you said it's going to be a title wave that could actually destroyed this guy\nWas asking the wrong question I just I just just totally what numbers don't add up what are you from the left or from the right I just want to know and then he couldn't do it I just wonder why I kept asking them\nBy either side is gonna fudge the numbers to make their party and look better it's heading back to the original point in my call is if you take a look at that uh that debate last night in our country as a teeter totter you have either one side or the other it's going to keep going up and down\nAnd then we get more of a choice than two people\nThis country is never going to find that equal balance it's always going to be swayed one way or another\nWas a real quick was Trump that choice\nI I think Trump or is it the best choice right we haven't had a good choice in this country in decades\nOr so here's the ... you know I I appreciate the call making a valid point maybe because nobody's going to go down third party they have to invade the Republican Party like Trump did ... and Bernie Sanders did exactly more decide talk radio W. B. O. B. [noise]\nBeing Don a and that's Donald Trump or neglecting all sense of reason in fact uh I preside over a city that is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate on trajectory to be at a twenty year low and our crime rate and no matter a brief statement at project or even twenty your\nCrime will come on folks who does that\nHave to say is going to change the fact that the CNN or Fox you have to bring facts to the conversation record them in an area for now our case we are the largest city in our twenties type of thing crime that they're going to vote on the underlying than so to Sanders kept saying do you have a record murders last year what Florida voters understand is\nThat communities will experience crime adjust in Jacksonville earlier today ... people shot the question is I'm sure of\nMarijuana carries a lot just to me it's like why do you have to bring up Jacksonville again I've got a probably a bit heated ... coming up\nWhat are we going to do about it and what I'm going to do is take on the n._r._a. and hold them responsible for the rent and crime and I'll\nGet paid way through the end now is to blame for the murders that are taking place it can I ask a question folks that maybe I just missed it and if I did please correct me did the n._r._a. cause the six shootings that happened over the weekend\nMy suspicion of course they're still investigating use if there were not in a hurry members who were involved no no no no they don't have\nTo be an already members Roger ... how the end or it used to be blamed where does he can already be blamed for this\nGosh you know what I Would have to wait for the investigation come out but I doubt that there was actually any type of direct calls or even in direct\nThere was a Andrew Gillum on his proposed Medicaid expansion in it\nThat helped to pass a Medicaid expansion in this state or by thirty nine to one and the Florida Senate under Republican control of an effort that my opponent opposes or if we expand Medicaid given the state of Florida we will a fin access to health care over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy Floridian\nThat is not the case of a now if you being kicked off because of your insurance premiums through the rates going up that's happened because of Obamacare that hasn't been truly done away with yet you get kicked off your health care plan you're on a state run Medicaid\nOkay and yet\nHe doesn't even talk about I'm not saying to end the Sanders hadn't even call them out on us that's yeah I get more emails about that this morning Roger how come the sentences and calling him out okay maybe it's the next debate I don't know but yet there are no work requirements are aren't what about the ages on that\nWhat else do you plan to do for this eight hundred thousand and by doing they won't be able to pull down six billion dollars from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states\nBecause six billion he's talking about what the feds come in and say we'll pay for the first three years old but after that you got to pick up eight percent of the tap oh wait we don't have enough money after you could pick up ten percent of the tap Roger wait a second\nI mean what have you ever knew the feds to pay for everything had to pay for all the Medicaid has taken place now and many of the states now has ... and ... correct on this so it was just ... has the fed to pay for the environmental cleanup on federal property know\nHave they done all this no\nAnd you you're going to rely on them to pay for all the cost of Medicaid expansion here in Florida\nWe philosophically disagree with uh getting access to health care or their hospitals to walk this they're doctors or nurses association we can build photos economies simply by extending access to health care and guess\nWhat how do you like that we can build the economy by more government intervention through Medicaid expansion\nNot only good for those uh eight hundred thousand people will get access it's also good for folks like me and for small businesses\nSo that was asked his was what to Santa said about his proposal\nPeople need to know these answers for this concept Medicare for all which is a euphemism because if you read it it actually about what's his Medicare for seniors Medicare Advantage\nIt abolished his try care and I was a veteran I Know that military families depend on it if you get your insurance through your employer abolish as that and it dumps all those people against their will regardless of what they want to stay in their current plan it dumps them on a single payer government system Pakistan's\nHas also brings up the point of what will happen if you tried to expand Medicaid here in the state of Florida\nSays will go through the roof ... face fiscal difficulties it will hemorrhage money and then the government will choose who get the care and who does that when you talk about this coverage what does that coverage you get to the fact is with Medicaid expansion people didn't have access to doctors most physicians do not accept new medicate take\nAnd what are you going to force him on that trip to talk nine zero for tripled to eight to five I don't know of dissent just hit the\nBall park but really don't know I think there's a lot more than the talk about the FBI isn't that what they talk about Trump what about the specific to talk about education no maybe next Wednesday night we talked about high crime I get it taxes\nThe ... I mean I think the standard set a decent job on that as well but you got to dissect his plan which we do on his radio show I don't know why the\nCongressman doesn't do it so more as we continue to move along talk radio W.

set and ready to go we got a lot of news to cover today that a lot of it has to deal with your back pocket and the election Mitt terms\nSo let's get on with the show CNN says that Republicans here in the state of Florida and throughout the rest of the country are causing are you ready for this bitter suppression and denying the voting rights clip number three CNN's John ... says here's where they're causing it to\nUnder the guise of protecting election integrity and who wouldn't want that Republicans in several states are knocking hundreds of thousands of people off the voter rolls\nIn Georgia nearly six hundred thousand people purge during one weekend in July but then additional fifty three thousand applications left in limbo in Indiana nearly five hundred thousand threatened with being knocked out voter rolls and Ohio I use it or lose at law for failure to vote and two consecutive elections may cause you to lose your registration\nIn swing states North Carolina and Florida attempts to roll back early voting and then nine deep red state thousands of polling places shuttered over the last five years this proportionately affecting poor and minority communities and in North Dakota voter ID laws that condition franchise thousands of Native Americans had about race but couldn't confirm determines control the Senate\nCritics say this isn't about integrity it's about winning elections by any means necessary\nAnd have you noticed that there isn't any problem in the white community says always the minority community North Dakota it's Native Americans here in Florida says and the black community um again we will just do it we will divulge all does miss that you just heard here\nAnd just a few moments even Jamal walking on the N. double ACP says that the current voting system put out there by the Republicans he says\nDiscourages people from wanting to participate in voting\nWe find that you know say a mother for who's going to work and have to travel past four or five polling places\nAnd she has to go through all these sort of hoops and ladders in order to actually cast their ballot when in fact she's a hardworking American until we start to look at the way and with the laws are constructed it's not designed for participation is designed to create barriers and we're seeing is that when laws like\nPhoto ID start to get past and when you start to the polling places in terms of you know early vote our being curtail the data shows actually limit\nParticipation water we want to do that in a country that values and prides itself on democracy and on for participation so for us we're really arguing that approach voters and there has to be the way to go\nThere is such a problem have you ever heard vote by mail I mean that does exist have you noticed that the and I'm not saying this as a protection I mean it's still looks like the Democrats according to the polls that they show up and vote or going to do quite well and the next several weeks for the next few weeks but if I'm reading too much into this\nIt sounds like if the dams don't pick up any seats where the money's what they projected they could just blame it to get on the Republicans in butter suppression\nThey can they can do that especially of a big media outlet like CNN which is really good with CBS saying that this was going on you know what I always take the position to avoid even the appearance of impropriety if it looks like it's bad then maybe look for ways to try to protect leaving the look that way you're going to\nGo to qualify you made it because it's a crime scene here you don't want to buy and gun just in case you may have to use it ... well again why is it that we always look for the good news in ... when I sit back and say you have to earn my goodness are\nThese new requirements that they're being pushed or these are things in the last\nI mean listen let's go back again when governor Rick Scott came into office in two thousand tag along with attorney general Pam Bondi\nTo get rid of dead people that no longer voted to get rid of them off the voter rolls haven't has that been done for decades decades have been not well not now now if that's the case and look at what happened up in Chicago Nineteen sixty what I'm getting at\nIs that they got rid of all the purge that is what they said ... the Democrats were up in arms guess who expected more Republicans more Republicans got kicked off the voter rolls because they found out that their ineligible living here anymore right\nWhere it you know what it was all the money one of the biggest complaints ... goes on is that\nYou need to have photo ID to vote and that's like any reasonable person thinks that's probably fair to do the complaint that a lot of people have they can't afford to get their driver's license renewed in some areas and they just catch the bus instead of a of the you know automatically deposited for their for their payroll how ... will be so difficult to have the supervisors were elections offices issued their own\nPicture ID and maybe tax some of the campaign superPACs so that might be or\nThat might be the right way to go back to cover everyone will you do know that they do offer motor voters at the driver's license so that your idea is still valid there as well but you kind of bring up an interesting point but they've already got an idea why would they need another idea\nWell some people say they don't have an idea and that's why they don't have\nThat how do they get around then who doesn't have an ID\nOr some people I Believe especially some of the major metropolitan areas that have really good public transportation they don't need a driver's license\nYou're at but they have to have an idea to buy things go to the bank and things like\nThat our days people have direct deposit they may have opened their bank account ten years ago but they didn't get a renewed but you still have to have an idea for that back when you had it yeah maybe it was cheaper back then but now they have ... have an ID now because maybe it expire and they didn't pay a hundred dollars to renew because it's more expensive now to get every news\nYou can still get a state id for almost free why didn't know the cost of yeah that was some cases that they do they do allow it the Supreme Court all wow Roger this has been a big issue on this radio show it has blown up\nThe phone calls from individuals on both sides the issue of dealing about regulating social media around censorship you know this you've covered this as well the Supreme Court this past week has agreed to hear a case that could determine\nWhether Facebook Twitter and other social media companies can censor\nUsers they've agreed to determine whether or not social media's can challenge this all on the main issue course of the freedom of speech remember what President Trump recently said about how we cannot tolerate political censorship when it comes to social media\nGoogle Facebook Twitter\nSocial media\nYou look at Google Facebook Twitter\nSocial media and I we can't change cannot tolerate\nCensorship\n\nTrying to\nRemember the president also recently just said that groups like Google and Twitter all these individuals are taking advantage of people\nReally think it is a lot of people and I think that's a very serious thing and it's a very serious\nCharge I think ... are doing if you look at what's going on it if you look at what's going on and face they better be careful because here you can't do that and people we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in\nI you know if you want in my opinion of course it doesn't matter to listeners but I think\nYou know yours there's wind I I think it has to do a whole lot with the free market because even if they thought Hillary is going to win and I think everyone did with the exception of just a few people um it was it didn't really take effect we didn't see all these major things going on consumer optimism until Trump took office\nAnd that's when they started talking about a thousand dollar bonuses increasing the minimum wage to work for certain companies\nFox Business news reporter Elizabeth McDonald says you know they're always want to use New York as a poster child and it's killing minimize the minimum wage is killing jumps in New York she reported\nThat fear on one side they say raising minimum wage it helps people and help their families and the business side they're saying now it costs jobs now this New York city restaurants or at a tipping point that restaurant owners and pushing lawmakers in New York City\nTo let them add up to five percent surcharge an extra taxes on restaurant customers\nNow did you hear that that in order to pay for the minimum wage the local government even the some of the states want to put a local surcharge on your food T. now Andrew Gillum has\nSaid we're going to have this discussion with the vice president of policy from ah the James Madison Institute sound news on the tax policies\nThat Andrew Gillum says that he wants to help subsidize companies that have to pay for the hike in the minimum wage the question is is during the exemptions Roger he's he's talking about every company is going to have to pay the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage\nThe question is if we're going to pay for these do you think here in many minutes of ... he's in Florida that in order to pay for this this might have to be the right way to go you know I mean for example the governor comes and says hey we're going to increase spending will get you get it has to take care of that bill the local school system local taxpayer\nIf minimum wages high dumb to Fifteen bucks an hour hypothetical here in Florida ... the cities have to pay for that could you be paying more at the uh the dinner table\nAnd and and what do you end up curtailing people's willingness to go out to where the money you know the the hamburgers and costs two dollars there's no more dollar Ninety nine so you're not going out is six Ninety nine menu\nMika Brzezinski Morning Joe Joe Scarborough say that with a lizard bits Warren pocket on releasing her DNA where she is one tenth of tense up a tenth of a chance of tens of thousands or whatever that she is American native she is a ancestry or from the Cherokee\nHum Mika Brzezinski says you know what the ... you guys see the the the touchdown right she says Dems need to stay on message she says Dems are actually getting off\nThe craft his last days talking about bill and Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren plans for twenty twenty [noise]\nAre they saying nothing stays ahead of critical terms yes they are guys and they will guys putting today to south twenty two days later from Hillary right now and talk about [noise]\n... they had a dog that they have and when she was taken advantage of an avenue\nFor the elections and a lot of what to think of it that will come out for me is not like a democratic friends\nGo down okay go to the phone banks say away from blenders in your kitchen call of democratic voters don't hurt because\nHe sounds like one of the cell evangelist go your phone's right now go to your phone's right now I mean here's the question how do you honestly believe that people in the midterms are going to have a recollection of something happened Twenty years ago this year with Monica Lewinsky Elizabeth Warren on an issue here in the state of ... I don't know if I buy into that\nWell you know they're talking about the you know the news real estate but the ... the news channels are talking about and that can take away from some of the things they write the Democrats but you know you really can't blame Hillary Clinton she was asked point blank by a reporter once you're supposed to talk about the economy instead of whether or not Monica Lewinsky was a factor or not\nWell you got to admit it is quite interesting that she says no it wasn't an abuse of power job listings not an all time high more jobless things and there are people looking for work Rick send tally from CNBC and Blakely advisor CIO Peter boot for\nHenry rain this year I thought that was good and the revised last month to seven million\nToday's number was even higher poison is unreal job openings any thoughts labor markets solid delivered just shifting to employees\nPlanes any thoughts that labor markets solid the leverage is shifting to employees as evidenced by this huge demand for labor the lack of supply and we're paying higher wages I think\nThe higher wages not from the government but then again from the free market which brings us into another conversation here Roger is a big discussion here in Florida ... about expanding Medicaid is there any type of work requirements with all the economy the way things are doing well Stewart volley ask book author Peter ... from the book\nPoor no more work requirements for those on state run Medicaid\nPosed just suppose hypothetical\nOf three children you gotta stay home to take care of those kids and you are single mothers single parent you get Medicaid would you be kicked off because you can go get a job when you've got three kids at home as long as\nDaycares available and daycare generally is available so daycare is available should be able to go to work that is what we did in Nineteen eighty Ninety six and that's why the rules went down and people went to war and no one went starving\nAnd welfare state run medicate star Parker the center for urban renewal and education says yeah we need to have requirements to come to work for those in Florida if Andrew Gillum gets to become governor and expand his medicate\nTake advantage of this new opportunity\nThat try to see if we can include work and training and other mechanisms so that people will move from sitting on their couch\nAs they're getting their Medicaid and maybe start getting more involved and participate in in their own lives and in our society where\nThe real issue on hand you're absolutely right out of that well for what Thirty years ago and nothing has changed since then we're able to just do whatever you want to do there's little requirement for people to get back into society there's not a requirement for the folks that are\nSitting there taking advantage of somebody else's work so this is a good move to start getting much more creative about how we distribute a anti poverty money's tax money to the states for them to help them\nIn Roger I mean the argument has\nTo be made it the economy's doing so well why do people need to become more on the roles of Medicaid and on welfare I mean the numbers are slightly drop it of runners but then again she may not be majority drop and been talking with things\nAre more you talk about Medicare for all and the expanding it I Believe that's going to encourage people already have but I think a lot of that but this was ... yeah yeah they are making them work and may be a good idea you know I Do have a heart for the single moms who have a toddler at home you know having to drop the kid off its it's expensive to send your kid to the child care\nIt may even be more expensive than actually paying for regular insurance policy\nActually have some some stake on like uh did you get America and all that kind of stuff out there and so more as we continue to move along talk radio WB obey\nMuch five south the Brooklyn Bridge to St

I mean you've gotten more black representation in the south for crying out loud and we've seen over the last forty years\nAnd in ... but but I mean if that's because we've allowed more voter access and how is this pretty more barriers\nI I think that the new real voter I the ... the ride the laws that have taken effect since nine eleven has really maybe ... maybe more difficult for people to get their driver's licenses renewed and ... and especially if they're not driving right now I've got a friend\nVery intelligent person had to return to the motor vehicle place three times because the rule I id law did they not require all the messed it up all these forms you no longer do you agree\nThat I Know what to pay rent you know I never advocated a real ID but yeah you do know that a lot of people can register online so\nMaybe you had an exemption on that one as well I read I don't go back and do my dinner ID or excuse me or my driver's I once\nYou upgrade from the old ... system to the one with the star on it then I think they have they been good but the initially to get that done\nThat I'm not I'm not back after nine eleven I'm I'm after we after nine eleven I so\nThey they don't show the rolling out when I started to expire which was like five or seven years after\nI still didn't mind without going back when\nLaws like photo ID start to get past and when you start to the polling places in terms of you know early vote our and being ... curtail the data shows actually limit participation why would we want to do that in the country that values and prides itself on democracy and on for participation\nReally had it again if you limit the days of early voting we pointed out that even after a bronco Obama in many states had limited because based on the resources of cost they were showing that many people were showing up and they limited here in Florida I think a lot for Thirteen to what was it nine days and they still have the same amount of people show up\nWhere are these voting barriers out there so why is it only won among minorities but it's not among other white people why is it I'm always curious by that or it\nMight be but only the minorities are blaming [laughter]\nI mean I don't have to [laughter] I don't think every individual from the minority is complaining are out\nThere for us but really arguing better pro voters and that has to be the way to\nRemember what Debbie Wasserman Schultz said a South Florida congresswoman\nOr that we could turn out the kinks\nNow you have the Republicans who want to literally drag us all the way an accidental cola\nAnd literally said patently block access to the poll voters who are more likely to those democratic candidates in Republican candidates and it's nothing\nCauses she's using the stereotype if he may be of a brown skin color you're automatically going to vote Democrat I don't buy into that\n... what if you're in South Florida you're Cuba just kind of curious on that one is what they literally want to take you back to Jim Crow more as we continue to move along All right let's take some calls\nMany people want to weigh in on this ah on these issues today Facebook voter id let's go to ah tripled you talk nine zero for triple do eight to five five Lawrence good morning you're on WB oh be\nA good morning they take him on I just want us\nI just want to say on the voter id law that Congress Republicans don't spend that money apparently so why didn't they just going to pass a law to pay for everybody to get around the and then we bought the ambulance argument\nWell you still find arguments against and they'll find out that that'd be better than the money wasn't properly ... distributed among maybe Republican states I mean it\nYou know and then all the uh\nThe Facebook controversy at Twitter ... ... you start talking about ferrets they look about what a pocket but I quit watching professional football because legal issue with the flag so\nIf you don't like Facebook do it and go do something or else it's it's a free country and it it's a that's a private company so I really\nAppreciate Roger before you're back to the phones you said you believe Facebook had was very instrumental in the two thousand sixteen a lecture and\nThose who are in what was in what way well there are a lot of ads who were purchased on Facebook who's seeing those ads by who would reach of I don't know\nI Know there was tend to one pay more by the Clinton campaign and out of quote Trump really yup huh\nAnd yet for Facebook at Facebook ads that's exactly correct and member member she outspent Trump bought five to one had out campaign from as far as maybe campaign workers eight to one here in the state of Florida Trump was still able to when you can defeat the monopoly so let's go to the gym\nI mean maybe not somebody at the gamble Ben Ali but hey Jim good morning on WB obey\nMoney and how you doing today hey good morning how are you doing I I Believe a lawsuit\nWith Facebook and these other social media companies have to do with whether they are platform or a publisher not so much a their freedom at the company I mean the New York times published anything they want but there are certain laws that\nAffect them at the publisher and ah you know Google you know so you do a search engine you search the word Republican state should come up just by highly hits it as well\nThey put an algorithm to adjust what you see now has become a publisher uh they're deciding what you see and that creates different laws so I Believe that's what the whole a case about whether their platform our publisher 'cause that affects how they can and cannot do this\nWell according to the article it's all based around the censorship of users out there I mean you we could I mean you you may bring up a valid point about being the publisher one way or the other but the bottom line is is that we're talking they're saying that should they not be able to censor speech in your post in my purse\nAnd you know I keep pointing out that I mean so Republicans aren't happy with it so now they want to regulate it I mean it's kind of like saying hey well you know the death as it was horrible under Obama but we got plenty of excuses why the deficit should increase under Trump\nWell I don't think it has to do with a crack about fairness it think it has to do with there are certain laws they have to follow suit paid settled Google uh you you have to follow certain rules current extra benefits you were given\nWell if you are not given those benefits even though you're a pay member while they no longer become that they're no longer a platform out there a publisher uh and and that's fine and you're right you're you're you're correct they can't get platform laws as a publisher\nRight but Jim you're talking for me for example Florida daily we pay on Facebook they'd always take her as we have to redo them and that's just the way Facebook has them but you're talking repay services says about free user agreements out there and should and that's the bottom line that's what the Supreme Court says\nShould these companies be able to censor it not based on you bring up a valid point you if it's if it's a pay every I agree with you because we're the ones who have a contract you do have certain rights and that contract but\nThis was a free user agreement then does the average Joe or gal have any right to to each to complain about Facebook of censorship one way or the other\n[noise] like if I were complaining about the New York times or what they published it can publish anything they want and Facebook can publish anything they want but they don't get to follow the same they want the same legal protection as a platform because they've officially become a publisher so I think the point is if it's a free site I should be able to use it as a platform is\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one FM W to six sixteen [noise]\nTalk

S. I. S. S. D. I. people could just get on and you have you ever see them get off\nTo see who ends up being the merchant federalized built sitting on the couch or the innocent children who were just happened to be

eat those that are football players and he would they 'cause they had a talent were able to break from the norm you know that's why they get millions out back to the community a lot of people can

well financially\nIn most cases it's a massive middle class and if you just took the black people in America isolated their network and you would have probably the seventh largest industrial power in

into the Democratic national convention just as an aside [noise]\nNext Rogers point with all the with all the identity theft\nI don't know that I'd want a picture of my id sitting around it they'll go for any bank employee to pull up somewhere he he may go to the same branch regularly and they recognize as ... as a courtesy they let him go by without showing an id but if he goes to a different branch they don't know I'm ...\nI don't know what I'm asking for an idea yeah\nI don't believe that's the case that could be I Believe that they actually can pull my face up when the heal my account or on a screen and they see a photograph of my idea but it's on on the account now whether it out there running policies in place to prevent them from doing that unless I show up I don't know\nWell my bank that I've been at for Twenty years and change they still make me showing id if I go to a different branch of people don't know normally yeah I'm the last part most importantly is buildings that responsibility and a right of citizens\nSo I'm the longer the voting period is the more easy it is for her to her it's not the point of it is not necessarily to make it easy to make it available and uh as the previous caller said\nThere is no difficulty in getting these for any purpose if you want to buy alcohol somewhere you have to have an id if you want to board a plane you have to happen I think so no I bought\nIt appreciate them I think the same way I can show mighty all the time and I've been with him for many many years Democrats said that if they are\nBulls the privileged which they think they are or if they get to take over the house of representatives in Congress this year that they will one of their first agenda items is to push for a ... team dollar an hour federal\nMinimum wage is you know Ron ... says this is the problem with Andrew Gillum campaign that this is what he wants to do many Democrats say that Haiti eight ten bucks not enough we do to get on the road of a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage the reason why well\nAmazon did it but the question is did Amazon do it because of the state government or did they do it because it was inevitable a lot of companies are going down that road based on the marketplace\nFormer Toys R us EEO general store said it was inevitable it was going to happen\nSo rated the inevitable and they were able to grab a victory from something that was a negative for them [noise]\nThe wages are going out no matter what the economy is very high unemployment is very low or you know uh the in some jurisdictions fifty hours hours going to be mandated [laughter] you know in some areas in New York City it's going to start at the turn of the turn of the year so [noise] even the get workers retires are having to pay more\nAlready so they saw this coming I Know I talked to a number of retailers constantly and many were already thinking about doing this\nHe says they're already thinking about doing this Roger based on the market place not least on the government yes it's true\nThat for example like New York city is now putting a surcharge on what you eat in your bill could that be possibly one of the agenda items that may be Andrew Gillum and other Democrats because they've said that they will support a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage if he gets elected but yet he says he also help subsidize companies that have to pay for that wage\nSubsidize the with money I guess ours that uh you know takes a lot of me thinking about whether or not that's good I watched\nIt is is is that because of the economy or is it because of government I like to hear from you and tripled to talk tripled to eight to five five Amazon November the person's going to pay all employees Fifteen bucks an hour a member here in Jacksonville they already said they were gonna start off up to Fifteen bucks an hour\nIs is because they feel that they still marketplace going down that road or do you think that they did it because it was inevitable that maybe some state governments may try to phases in at Fifteen bucks an hour it's\nPossible you a little bit of that plus may be able to get PR move because as we heard earlier a they're going to be phasing out the stock options when they roll out the Fifteen dollar minimum ... wage so that actually ended up causing them to a compensated their employees even less even although they're getting\nThe causing them to a composite of their employees even less even although they're getting more per hour\nThat fear on the one side they say raise the minimum wage it helps people and help their families and on the thing is it's either saying no cost jobs now this New York city restaurants or at a tipping point that restaurant owners now pushing lawmakers in New York City\nTo let them adding up to five percent surcharge an extra tax on restaurant customer that we've got a group representing more than one hundred restaurants tourists they drafted a letter\nNoting that they have endured nine mandated wage increases over the past that wire also a lot of rules and regulations and other wage hike to Fifteen bucks an hour\n... if it Gillum gets elected governor he's leading all the polls right now and he becomes governor okay and he wants to go down to Fifteen dollars an hour minimum wage remember John Morgan says he or don't want to put on the ballot in two thousand twenty bucks twenty twenty\nWhich means I Wonder if they make compromises ten twelve bucks an hour I think that's ... ... if you want to pay for it they're talking now in fact some people will be before the id you just heard from Fox Business news Elizabeth McDonald as a surcharge an extra five percent on your meal on your tab\nIn order to suffice of pain for that that means that local cities will have to pick up the tab that means that local restaurants are going to charge you more they're going to be mandated to have to raise your taxes\nTo pay for the surcharges and they'll just be an extra rely on your bill I Would imagine what's stopping the restaurants just charging more for the ... the way\nBecause they have to disclose all that in some cases triple to

Q\nA and gets the legislature go along on the corporate tax increase you'd lose ... found a hundred and fifty thousand jobs in the state every year and the anywhere you know in the neighborhood of Fifteen to twenty billion dollars in economic activity\nThat in turn create the ... effect on revenues so you Jack up the corporate tax rate and you end up with less revenue to fund the things that government canning really should be do\nAlso you guys broke it down with Ron ... is there anything new or innovated that's just than just wants to do\nWith the current economic climate you know because or does he want to keep the status quo you know a lot of people argue against the status quo but the status quo seems to be what relatively working under President Trump and governor Rick Scott\nDoes he want to keep things the way they are going now or is there any difference between the current policies we see that the census also maybe wants to implement\nSure there are a couple of specific tax cuts that are are really important that Jim I Want been a proponent of of ... in debt for variety of reasons we have it at first is the communication service tax uh every single person with a cell phone aids is a Florida is the highest in the country\nUm and it it's something that can and should be brought down to a more reasonable level a candidate to saint as as as absolutely or advocated or that it at all the puzzle the second one is a business rent pack\nThis is something that Florida has that no other state in the country does we we had a sales tax on the leaf thing of buildings it hit every rent or whether you're a small business or an individual\nYou're paying for this and a candidate to say it has has has indicated he would like to get rid of that\nUm but largely a other than those two things on the tax and economic trajectory he he really wants to and and I would say wisely maintain a lot of the policies of Jeb Bush in ... that have created on average about two hundred thousand jobs year\nWe bounce back from the great recession faster than any other uh any other state the United states unemployment rate is it three point seven percent and\nUm they nationally or just yesterday there's there over seven billion open jobs right now and that is a a clear sign of of the economic health and that's kind of the message that I think are the candidate that this is a kind of come back\nWe're talking with sound news though he's the vice president of the policy for the James Madison Institute added Tallahassee the website James Madison dot org they've got a breakdown of both policies on tax situations would\nExcuse me with Andrew Gillum and that a ... but what's out what I find fascinating is this whole debate around the minimum wage you know Amazon did it they said it was inevitable um eat on Bernie Sanders in the last say that it was because of been promoting it uh the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage we have the free market people say now because of the economy that's why\nA lot of people may go even though it may not happen overnight but through certain pay a month to pay a pay increase will go up\nHaving said all that if you have a fit teen dollar an hour minimum wage\nThe the uh Gillum supporters and give them self as hinted that they can also take care of and held businesses that are that deal with that mandate I'm always curious how what do you because he doesn't exempt small businesses in his plans how about a hundred employees you're going to pay the minimum wage at five employees no exemptions you're going to pay the minimum wage\nHow does he planned to fly and small businesses if he gets his way\nThis is the this is the tack of someone with socialist tendencies or this is ... if you're going to create a floor for wages and then use taxes in order to prop up the businesses that can't pay it\nIs an actor is a recipe for economic catastrophe now is ultimately in any any economist will tell you ultimately the minimum wage is in fact the hero because the folks who do not get employment because of the minimum wage\nThey're not getting paid a Fifteen dollar minimum wage would be\nAlmost double what Florida has right now\nIt'd been tried in places like Seattle and a couple of other jurisdictions they have huge regret they're they're just\nThe leading jobs and bleeding businesses from any areas that have that have been counted\nYet Amazon implemented a Fifteen dollar minimum wage but were members of the Amazon they fight it or a private market company in in order to enact or that Fifteen dollar minimum wage they they eliminated all their incentive funding they eliminated their bonuses they say that\nShift we're going to shift the money from incentive or pay into a minimum wage

B. O. B.\nSo is the campaign continues one of the biggest questions issues um especially here in Florida\nIs Ron dissenters run on the status quo which is believe it or not is usually you run against but the status quo was worked here in Florida\nFor many years under governor Jeb Bush will slow down with Charlie Crist the governor Rick Scott when it comes to the issue of\nFinancial solvency our friends at the ... center\nAt George Mason university you have a recent study they do this every year about the financial solvency of all the top states highly Norcross is the vice president a policy at their McCain of center she's here on our news making line so what made this more interesting about this I lead that this more than a decade\nFrom that of the great recession you guys are pointed out that that Florida still rings in the top five but\nNot all the other states have recovered why is that\n[noise] yeah um some states haven't recovered poor fiscal practices states that have ranked at the bottom of our study have shown and edit the only ever climbed to balance the budget or to have enough for a rainy day and continue to rely on duct tape for some of their ongoing extensions\nThe top five number one was Nebraska number to South Dakota number three was Tennessee number four was Florida number five was Oklahoma the bottom five this isn't surprising a was Kentucky Massachusetts\nNew Jersey Connecticut at the bottom of the list Illinois holy mackerel\nCourse a lot of those except for me to Kentucky are blue states having said that Florida did ring number one last year they dropped down to number five why was that\nA drop in his he changed the methodology a little bit we weren't paying a lot of weight on the short term thirty percent or past thirty percent for budget this year we moved away so that that's the reason for that drop otherwise if we have kept those weights on they'd be in second place this year but that being said you go back and look over the last ten years and Florida that's pretty well\nWhen you when you look at this where is the areas that Florida ... ... is the strongest when you talk about quote financial stability and financial solvency\nActually do well in all category but at the tick you're on the short short run they've gotta and how the level of cash reserves change four and five times the cash\nNeeded to cover the short term that their revenues exceed expensive like seven percent that that's a little bit of a buffer and then on the long run they get better than average or they have half the size of the liabilities a solitary assets of other states and their pension liability again are smaller relative to the other states\nI leave that wait a second I only be average it will be listening to this I said is a little tongue in cheek but you look at the other states at the bottom fifty that don't like so well with funding to solvency every year are always increasing taxes and yet they don't have enough money yet Florida for the last several years has been cutting taxes and you just said they've got a lot more cash on hand\nMhm yeah that's right I think it's just ... and these are only very general metrics\nHere so we can't say too much about it but we can say that forward it does seem that tricking practices at having enough money on reserves and not and and their revenues are are greater than expenses I'm like at the bottom states for New Jersey for instance has not had had been running a structural deficit for well over a decade\nThere on our newsmakers ... north across is the VP of policy I threw McCain center at George Mason university they do this every year they put out all the state rankings of physical health fiscal stability fiscal solvency and it's a great study we followed many years you go to the website ... dot org McKay to start or let me get a little deeper in the weeds here\nUm Florida still does quite well in the top ten when it comes to unfunded pension liability is out there and what makes floor to different than from other states\nI Would say I'd say that a little bit of caution Florida does better relative to the other states All right um\nAnd it but you're you're you're up against Illinois and New Jersey and others but when you look at the unfunded liability I go back in and re value that like it's guaranteed to be paid for his reporting a twenty four billion dollar uncharted liability I re estimate that and I say it's closer to two hundred and fifty three billion unfunded a which means it's only\nThirty seven percent find that that's pretty large a\nRelative to the income state residents you know it it is it's it's twenty seven percent of the income of the residents of Florida said again it's better relative to the other\nTwenty seven percent of the income of the residents of Florida said again upset or relative to the other states but it's still pretty large and something Florida should just keep an eye on\nFinally these you know the Supreme Court came out in this past year and the Janice decision about you know about certain funds being taken away from those of union members to fund political campaigns\nSome people think this is going to have a trickle down effect dealing with some of the states because there are some states that have their pensions and unfunded liabilities tied to a state constitution remembers for example if some of these states go south they may have to acquire a bailout from the federal government this has been very under reported issue that you guys have covered\nAnd yet we we've been watching that for a while and take your Illinois but that states everyone is looking at because of that constitutional protection and the court has ruled that yeah you can't cut these benefits you're gonna have to figure this out so it it is it going to come from taxes or they can't cut the benefits and that's a huge number so that as a concern and arrest that they would seek a federal bailout\nEileen is this just among Illinois or is this among other states again where they tied way getting let me ... I mean before we go for the let me explain this little bit even though you're a policy\nThat some people they may try to pass a an amendment like amendment twelve or whenever it in a certain stadium just give me a hypothetical\nHey we want to keep pension solving voted this amendment blah blah blah it's part of the state constitution which means some cases unless the state government can do something about the legislative process they have to have another voter approval is Illinois the only state we see with a lot of these problems are we seeing other states out there as well\nFor a couple of states the constitutional protections New York in Alaska\nOther states protect these benefits in statutes a New Jersey a several dozen other they they protected and statues and makes it harder for the benefits to the altered or so and then we had California rolls and California which is it's a very\nSimilar to that and that it said like you can't take a benefit away once granted some states I use that as the guidelines so yes it depends on the nature of the promises constitution are statute and the degree to which it can be changed\nI mean when you guys do the studies every year and you really breaking down compared to other groups out there again go to McCain does that or read the latest physical a solvency among the states here in the country for last year number one this year they're ranked number four but still doing overall pretty good compared to the national average\nWhen you guys do this you heavily and to me I think the pensions unions is always a big issue here in this country are there are states that they were blue or red or they finally getting the idea that hey you know where the floods arising here you better start preparing for the day or they still kicking the can down the road\nI Would argue that the wealthy that work an extreme amount of hours have a harder time getting out to register to vote because of the amount of hours that they work there is actually a a video for campus reform where they went and interviewed students from Berkeley\nAnd then they went and interviewed individuals whack individuals' from Harlem and asked them if they thought it was a racist or discriminatory they get a voter id and the kids from Berkeley all came up with the same conclusion that\n... ... oh well they're poor or they don't have the means or they do a or they're not intelligent enough to know where to go vote\nWhere all the individuals from Harlem came out and said you know oh yeah I Know exactly where to go oh yeah I got my driver's license oh I've got that and it just goes to show you the race that might not last that they think that black people are incapable of taking care of themselves to register to vote\nYou know that's an interesting take em you got cities like Chicago let me let me ask this question to James is pointing US cities in Chicago South Florida\nThat are pushing for an ID card for homeless people and for\nIllegal aliens now folks if they want to push for those individuals\nThen why is it that we want to relax it for those that are already here in this country somebody say legally and\nAre contributing to society out there is that makes sense I mean I I mean here is a I think\nWhat you're going to get a lot from the minorities was probably a backlash from history because you know I think all of us will agree to colonize God if people are those thoughts of their minds they haven't gotten over a decade issue\nBut remember I keep asking current cats right forget the past I understand about the future current tense forget the history because Jim\nCrow not only did affect poor black individual also affected poor white Republicans out there [noise] so how long are we going to use this history card out their\nTripled to talk tripled to eight to five five let's go to John John good morning you're on WB obey\nWell that's what the communist Democrats use right rape racism and uh the rich but anyway I wanted to go back to you know your economics professor who had on there talking about that the\nState constitution to uh uh basically guarantee stay pensions listen that means the CFO could be Donald Duck and the tax payers are still on the hook correct that should be abolished we all take our risks in the market and we're all susceptible\nIt should be abolished we all take risks and market and we're all susceptible to marketing okay the Fifteen dollar minimum wage is an absolute\nJoke about paperwork a hair salon fast food restaurants gas stations cold boost movie theater I tend to try a state landscape present the fire holders this time it was an all your overtime might what radiance will be gone\n[noise] your benefits will be gone they're using one trillion dollar company for all your little you know all the businesses are poor member were foot radiant because we have the policies of the nor we had anyone that goes up to the north despise us those policies\nOkay and I wonder worn on my ... about ... amendment eleven amendment a lemon on the ballot is used for illegal aliens that are caught committing crimes okay basically gives them a waiver from any type of prosecution or or or um what's it called property confiscation now now the ... which is the uh\nThe F. L. C. R. C. left all this information\nOut of the ballot okay it just says oh do you want your property rights or soccer protected and they say yes or no mentions nothing about illegal aliens and you won't get that Lehman book you have to ask for the amendment book because you will not get it at the poll I already voted and I voted red\n... you know with all the amendments or did you vote for a couple in favor\nI voted and couple in favor alright I had to ask for the amendment book but I voted for it was it was so distracted let me tell you something that's on elected appointed counsel right should be abolished\nThey should be abolished the F. L. C. should be abolished period we let the legislators make policy not these cars it let me tell you something even though a lot a lot of them were reported by the governor there left is there actually you know\nYeah I mean and I got to get go I uh I'm a constitutional measures nobody cares about how I ... there's a problem that you have to redo\nBecause it's in the state constitution for example the tax exemption you have to keep it going by voting in the state constitution amendment\nOh you were looking like California folks and ...\nAnd fellow no voting rights restoration that's going to be handled because the court said we've got to do something about that one yeah they\nGot all this can be done through the state process you're elected representatives out there but yet we seem to want to disparage your boat I mean we want to give you a say but you vote for certain individual that needs to vote on these issues and we're just saying about would leave it to the people like gambling like\nMarijuana and then they write it's such a confusing ways are set to throw one of them off the ballot\nFrank good morning you're on WB obey\nHey how you doing hey what's going on this morning well you know it's kind of funny how these people who don't have the ability to go get an id ah and fill out paperwork have the ability to uh fill out the paperwork to get food stamps welfare and everything else [noise]\nWell I Would think when you need an ID for that as well\nYes you do I'm unemployed and I have to uh these people have to fill out paperwork\nStep up no problem doing that\nYeah I mean you have to have an ID for most anything today\nPardon my pond from Atlanta it's ludicrous little hip hop lingo therefore you triple too dark triple to eight to five five but bottom line today is why do you not need an ID or why do you need an ID theater and says hey\nVoter suppression you're voting rights Brett Kavanaugh by the way because of him that Donald Trump putting more but because of Brett Kavanaugh Yu king chairs all of those goodbyes what he's saying more coming up next on TALK radio W.

board with the idea of legalizing marijuana\nContact the dean\nShow on AM six hundred and one on one one one event for calling to to to to to to find my email and then you'll read on\nGood morning three minutes after the hour we got a busy Thursday morning of course Roger all the additives that never busy well sometimes it's never a busy but anyway I stay busy Rogers things really busy I just kind of sit here and try to look at it but we got a lot going on first debate coming up Sunday Roger in Tampa in fact both candidates\nI'm of a Rhonda Santa than Andrew Gillum will be in Jacksonville today\nBut yeah a lot going on of course we're coming down the home stretch of the electorate the first debate that was scheduled for this past Tuesday but because of hurricane Michael a deal he had he had to pull\nOut and bought it and by the way I Do is it whenever I may not agree with Andrew Gillum I give I mean whether it's for political purposes or not um\nDang if you do damned if you don't if he would have gone to the debate not looked at two in the city of Tallahassee where he's the mayor he would have been thrown into the bus so politically and otherwise he did the right thing\nRight right and to be honest and we are looking for to the debate coming up\nWell I Am but I don't know about some other people and\nMore as we continue to move along higher buddy ed dean here along with Roger Anderson\nWe've got a lot of news coverage today after the record debt well it's not a record deficit but the deficit has been the highest now of almost seven hundred and eighty billion dollars high now under President Trump then that over the last five years since ... now the president getting some kind of criticism\nFrom those on the conservative vile is asking his department heads that they need to cut government spending by five percent Fox News' Mike Emanuel without report\nRelieving President Trump's message to his cabinet today was it is time to get a handle on spending\nThat would likely mean finding savings for the fiscal twenty twenty budget proposal which would be sent to Congress early next year\nAnd while the president makes its recommendations every year Congress controls the power of the purse\nAnd lawmakers will do their own spending plan the president's belt tightening demand comes as the treasury reports the budget deficit rose Seventeen percent over the previous year to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that's the highest is twenty twelve and that has upset fiscal hawks\nToday Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters he liked to cut spending too but noted Republicans believed the military and either to be rebuilt with a range of threats around the world\nMcConnell saying today quote my opinion is to spend as little as possible I don't get to make that decision we have to negotiate that with various other interests who have different demands and that's where we ended up doing a two year deal we had to agree to more domestic spending than we would have otherwise engaged in\nAcross the board cuts which the president has proposed are likely to remind many here in Washington of sequenced ration which was part of the budget Control Act in twenty eleven in terms of spending caps going forward McConnell says there'll be negotiating that based on who wins the election that puts even more at stake with the upcoming midterm elections\nNow we can spend all day and it's usually the Republicans want less spending as it is McConnell doesn't have a track record about that to some of my conservative listeners that say the reason why we had a balloon the deficit is because of military spending\nThat's wrong we've had at one point three what one point four trillion dollar spending bill that's not even the size of the budget\nThat a military spending went from five sixty seven hundred two hundred billion dollar increase well what about the other I don't know seven hundred billion that was spent yeah so when I hear some of my conservative listeners sit back and say well we had to do it because of the military I don't disagree that the military planes need to be refurbished we have to build things up\nBut then again when you hear the Democrats right that the Republicans say well we had to do a lot of domestic spending as well\nI mean hello so yeah president President asking agencies that cuts ... percent of their budget [noise]\nI Would like to come back with a a guy\nThe way\nI'm sure you can do it I'm sure everybody has to say what can you hear him five\nPercent by only ... percent start baby steps you know one step at a time you know baby steps were talking about cutting government for Thirty years when I go to Danny something is being done and I just want to congratulate the president for waking up every morning and listening to this show because I was a\nLong time you know I can get the fact that you cannot always control what Congress does you've got both sides of the aisles everyone would get their ... and you can't you know fund the troops that lets you\nKnow Roger Roger hold on hold on to it you can't call it pork barrel spending Roger they don't like to call them how they find the constitutionality due to\nWhatever the case may be you can't necessarily control what comes out of Congress but the president can certainly tell US Cabinet members don't spend everything and it has the same that effect\nWith less than just a few weeks before the election the house as the polls now within the generic but also among those close elections and Hillary won that President Trump won in two thousand sixteen\nBut now the odds for the Senate remember a week or so ago it was fifty one forty nine ... now Bret Baer from special report says those numbers of actually increase in the U.S Senate for Republicans to maybe fifty three maybe fifty four seats\nFrom the mid term elections and as we look at the situation for the house\nWe can tell you that Democrats continue to hold the advantage in the generic congressional polling current\nFox News pulling team looking at race to race across the country says election were held today the house would likely slip Democrats now our latest poll just out today shows that Democrats maintain a seven point advantage on that national number\nWhen it comes to enthusiasm Republicans have picked up on the ground in recent weeks\nAmong likely voters democratic enthusiasm as you see here is also jumped as well\nLet's take a look at the races for US Senate and where we are as it stands right now tonight this is the scenario with Republicans and since he won Democrats and forty nine election were held today and all the candidates for US Senate held on even small leads to they have in the average\nYeah in all of the candidates for US Senate held on even small leaves that they have an average of recent polls Republicans tonight with pickup Missouri North Dakota\nEverything else instead of saying no other changes they pick up the next two seats fifty three forty seven\nAnd then he went further and said may could be possibly fifty four now vets is going to be interesting let's go ahead and act like the the the races already done with okay okay well let's say that\nThe house is picked up by the ... who knows but let's say hypothetically it as the Senate picks up more seats\nJust President Trump takes the blame on the credit\nFor the house losing but then the Senate Republicans because well let me play for you to quit the press and they came out this past week and said that if Democrats win back the house he's not to blame in fact he tells Tricia Reagan from Fox Business news that if the Republicans lose it's not his vote it's the voters for not coming out to vote for it primarily his base\nLot out for public health this as an industry that wants to kids and other people with pot and got me candy soda wow unlimited potency of different marijuana products that will be out there\nPot gum you remember if you were kids\nI knew that I have a being being only in my twenties mania Roger um but my older brothers who are in the eighties memories the bubble gum used to put in your mouth it looked like he came like you could put in your mouth that looked like dip\nYeah I remember but it wasn't ... it was like gum and during the ones you follow it your parents didn't like it used to smack you when you had it in front of a church when he showed on the front row and distracted preacher and the preacher like your parents know afterwards right now it's no more text messaging [laughter]\nSo he's saying that now what's what's going on down the road is is you know we're trying to make cigarettes you know Joe Camel and all the movies that cigarette smoking is actually appealing remember they had some of the candies years ago or it looked like it was a cigarette but it's really much more than a candy\nHe said this is what the marriage you wanna call marriage on it that's what it's called in the seventies the marriage all want a crowd and that's what they want to push Cory Gardner\nThe well known Republican senator from Colorado says for Florida and other states it is a jobs creator and she'd be a state's\nRights issue thousands of jobs at risk [noise]\nMillions of dollars in revenue\nAnd certainly the question of constitutional states' rights\nOf this discussion now\nI find this is a fascinating debate because again let's remember for example for for example scale excuse me remember ... the mayor of Miami a former top rank candidate for governor here says it their party is looking towards the goal of of taxing and regulating marijuana in Florida\nRick ... so we chose to do it\nI Believe the state of Florida needs to legalize marijuana we need to regulate it we need to taxes\nOkay so the Republicans have said that maybe we need to go down the road is unstoppable Roger the economic regime revolutions going to be kicked into high gear 'em ... is is is it inevitable is this going to happen here I\nPersonally believe it is and that but of all to be Frank why I said well you know what this is this the trend in in the culture and people want it yeah and younger people especially are getting older they embrace it was just like an older generation may embrace\nOf the uh the elimination of prohibition this is their you know freedom to drink alcohol but in the modern choice I personally don't support it the biggest problem I've got with more than anything else is the problem of second hand smoke\nYou know someone smoking marijuana they can't just keep that to themselves you know if they're out in public but you know the the whole concept with tobacco smoking has always already given us the president precedent that if you're outdoors in the wind's blowing that it's okay to blow your smoke if someone's face I can see that happening with marijuana ...\nHere's the question I'm always fascinated because this debate you and I both been reporters many years here in Florida I'm always been curious because\nEven though even the libertarians right who are against a lot of government but they can't wait for the government get involved in marijuana ever you've always been kind of curious about that but having said that when they talk about taxing it well what do you plan to tax that number two how do you plan to tax it because you've\nGot certain stores or is it going to be a monopoly like medical marijuana is in the state of phone number three how are you going to regulate it out there that's to me the books they haven't even find that when you know Roger they got to a full area how they still want to regulate medical marijuana here in\nThe ... exactly what it would be available at convenience stores eventually or just a space re type places and how close to those schools will eventually we see a gradual right inclusion\nBut you think it's inevitable because based on the culture I mean do you think Republicans will get an member painter\nThat these guys never liked it here but of course I guess when you get paid as lobbyists oh we all of it now paid a lot of money that's right he's in the next ... they said the ... and then in in an economic revolution is the next green economic boom out there and do you believe that Republicans were in the state of poor because they're talking about really moving this fast\nForward and twenty twenty [noise] the reason why many there was like sixty cities I mean there's a pilot he said do not support medical marijuana is number one the reason why they don't want to Spencer is in their backyard is because there's no money for these counties we make it's all going to be a monopoly gives the Tallahassee\nIf the money could be divvied up do you think number one a medical marijuana more cities would advocate it because there's more more brain coming into the coffers and number two if they if it was a\nEven it was reasonable cell and that's and that's open for interpretation to go full blown a tax and regulated I Wonder if more cities here in Florida will go by we\nAlong with it and it probably would but we are talking about the government wanting to be elected officials wanting more money to spend I think when it comes down\nWe would we were talking about the government wanting to be elected officials wanting more money to spend I think when it comes down to the actual taxpaying citizens if they could eliminate some property taxes or some sales taxes with it it may even be embrace more by the public as opposed to just be elected\nA kind of like the excuse is being used a for offshore drilling yeah maybe gambling some of advocated that it can lower your property taxes and everything else get rid of them call some of the issues coming up the next couple of weeks the Hilton from the next revolution on Fox News says\nHere's an issue that ranked in the top four top five that hasn't been discussed a whole lot lately but with a bunch of those ... through Central America up to the United states immigration can be a big issue [noise]\nGenerally speaking live e bay the elections I've what color is that it's much easier to change\nThe agenda that political agenda will pay more to people talking about what's on the front of that in mind when they go and vote that is to change their opinion so that's good news for Republicans their health care really is at the front of people's minds and so they need to work really hard to raise that\nThe relevance of the issues that strong and I always think the economy but that's another I point to which of the immigration\nIt's actually quite far down that list but it's one where the base of the Republican Party strongly agrees with President Trump stands for ... years agenda changes for this caravan coming up through Central America not raised the relevance of an issue that\nCould be good to get out the Republican base\nYou know to me the interesting debate about immigration I think a lot has to do with identity theft also dealt welfare benefits and things like that huge identity theft and among the illegal immigration crowd we covered that a fake ID cards fake state run Medicaid card so take Social Security card out there\nI'm taking the jobs are national security I get all that if you had to pay in one down as a top tier ratio that you think would matter to the voters of all the process of immigration and illegal immigration what would it be you\nKnow what honestly and then the people who might get mad at me for saying this but I think that they are people in America who feel their cultures being threatened\nWe having an invasion coming in is that it's been described by many from Latin America and you walk around the streets the United states of America you're basically in a foreign country with everybody speaking a different language than your own I think that there's actually some bias against people because of the Hispanic culture\nAnd really maybe I'm wrong ... and uh I'd be ... welcome people to correct me if that's not the case\nBut I think that probably use a ... an unspoken political politically correct reasons as a reason why people have a\nPro or or do you think there is a biased because they may not the Republican\nThat is also a big issue I Believe as well but you don't hear and probably because it's not that big of a problem we don't hear a lot of problems with you know people complain the Canadians are coming in\nCuba so yeah I don't like Canadians are not the most conservative crowd Cubans okay yeah but then they'll go to Bali they speak English or at least most of them do you think well yeah but [laughter]\nNot speaking my health care language I can tell you that right now oh man Twitter Twitter pure hypocrisy when

I Believe it will eventually happen and Republican should do it anyway because maybe because of the money and also a politically I Believe we're getting more support may be throwing some you know some Democrats that are a little torch what do\nYou think that the Republicans came out and endorse legalization of marijuana you think they might pick up some ... soft Democrats huh\nOh absolutely because I Believe um\nWhat's it like you know it ... red and that was when they legalize medical so you know it went conservative one way but it also did a medical marijuana so that's why I'm kind of making that would be\nYou know what if if the majority of people support keeping roe versus Wade and let's get I'm planning a hypothetical here let's say the Republicans kind of soften their views on roe versus Wade do you think Democrats in Florida would also maybe across party lines and vote for him\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one at one point one of them ...\nTo ...\nTalk radio\nNews as our town hall dot camera Thomas\nSays about Saudi Arabia is a key\nAlly in the middle east he is not giving coverage of the Saudis when it comes to the disappearance and presumed killing of Saudi columnist your mouth your show he and his latest and final call them to show he made a case for freedom of the press in the mid ...\nColumn written by ... to show that was received by the Washington Post a day after he was reported missing has been published in the column could show the a frequent critic of the Saudi crown prince whites that governments in the middle east have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate\nAs corresponded Mike Russia Wisconsin authorities say a missing girl's parents were shot to death and they believe the teenager was in the home at the time at least you're still searching for Thirteen year old you and me cough Congress mastering you're asking executives from Kenya and Hyundai to testify next month about fires and some of their cars\nRequests follows hundreds of reports of spontaneous fires melted wires and smoke in two thousand sand through two thousand Fifteen models the center for auto safety is also demanding a recall of nearly three million vehicles\nIn a press release it says there's been nearly one non collusion related fire infected models every single day for the past four months\nA company spokesman says they're reviewing the invitation to appear that the company has already monitoring reports of buyers and acts quickly to recall any vehicles with safety related issues\nCapitol Hill corresponded while the Heinz a treasury department employee is free on bond there being charged with leaking confidential banking reports of people charged and special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe dangerous flooding persists across a large swath of central Texas there's more rain and the forecast\nOn Wall street this morning ... futures down Seventy points more\nOf these stories a town hall dot com\nMorning at least beltway going south there I Ninety five we see a broken down car right now if you're on a jet headed toward downtown traffic building from between late avenue in Stockton and on both were boulevard between Hodges boulevard and San Pablo wrote traffic\nBaltimore boulevard between Hodges boulevard and San ... wrote traffic's building there as well we're looking at around forty percent chance of rain today at a high of eighty one this evening more impossible overnight below Seventy four and currently in Seventy three at W. B. O. B.\nAnd here are the top stories were bringing you this morning President Trump says he won't accept blame if Republicans lose the house in November arguing that he is helping Republican candidates in the midterms\nSome Republicans are saying that it's time for the geo pay to get on board with the idea of legalizing marijuana\nWas showing the Florida governor's race in a dead heat the first debate will take place this Sunday in Tampa\nContracts the ads being shown on AM six hundred and one on one one one event for going to talk for eight to five word email you read\nOur number two good morning three minutes after the top of the hour at dean here along with Roger Anderson right here on TALK radio W. B. O. B. we're taking calls this morning a lot of issues ranging from\nRepublicans telling other Republicans do embrace the idea of full blown legalization of marijuana collars at the six AM our Roger say well from an economic standpoint Republicans could probably benefit from that right and\nThey won't actually probably just you know six seven percent of it everything else was tax will probably be significant sin taxes applied and bring it may be a lot of money\nWill get into all these and other issues as we continue to move all along the party's been ... some would say the Republican Party but that a President Trump many people don't know who's possibly uh right now the leader\nOf the Democratic party but the author the book the great revolt brat Todd says that with the elections coming out it's going to be interesting to see how the president does and the president's support a lot of it could be based on how he was involved with the Brett Kavanaugh situation\nWell the cabinet confirmation is a pretty big deal for the Republican coalition you know we've we doing three the book where we believe that there's a realignment that's taking place in the Republican electoral coalition a slightly different than what it had been in previous years and I've been to this point in the Trump Administration you've had the old traditional Republican part of the ... coalition\nNot quite know the value long term is Trump is I mean you had some voters who like Trump better than they liked Republicans and they didn't say the value and electing a Republican majority\nIn the Kavanaugh's confirmation Republicans saw that it took a someone as tough as Donald Trump to stand by Kevin and get them through that fire and Trump or saw that it took a Republican majority to achieve the president's object 'cause that's pretty important going into the election\nJohn was asking when it comes to the Democrats and Republicans into base in let's say there's a lot of\nYour mind myself I think it's my headsets my that part of stereo just a little bit I'm Roger he was asked okay if if the votes going to determine with independence and remembers we've been reporting for many supervisor of elections here in the state of Florida\nPeople that are changing or when I say register not new registered but people that are just registering that means when you change your party affiliation Uri registering to vote for them included as well\nIn the biggest group is non party affiliations out there he breaks it down on which way the non party affiliated independence may go\nOn to Americans in this in this election and for Democrats they pay their hopes on those dance suburbs the\nKinds of Americans in this in this election and for Democrats they pay their hopes on those dance suburbs there were a lot of suburban women independent women are having to have negative news or the president Republicans meanwhile have a great chance in states where there are a rural industrial voters\nAnd you know I think immigration rising is an issue in favor of Republicans if it becomes a bigger issue toward the November elections you know independent tend to side with Republicans on immigration and other security type issues and they side with Democrats on things like health care and education\nNow we know that when you look at the polls education again I don't know why it's never really discuss what we do it on this radio show but then as you look at the numbers the economy healthcare is number one immigration is also within the top five there when you look at some of the statewide polls\nAnd the Fox news polls if this race is based and again it just yeah if it's based on a course getting the voter turnout also based on non party affiliation and independence\nAnd he'd sit back and say well if they like uh uh they they signed with the Republicans on taxes and immigration but they agree with the Democrats on healthcare healthcare is number one issue ... then you would think the independence becomes split or they need a little bit more to the Democrats\nYeah they could and you know it but the polling data is so close to right now we can go either way and I think maybe even those MPA with on party affiliated independents they may even be split\nPresident Trump says that he's not to blame that the Republicans lose the house he says everybody on his base should be pumped up but he says if they don't win he uses the voters are going to have to blame themselves fantasy\n[noise] then it's got to be clear it up we're going to get along I think the economy is going to care a lot of things so when people are really getting the jobs they want but we have a tremendous powerful vase the Republican Party [noise]\nAnd they have to know that going after the midterms is very important it's almost like going out for the twenty twenty elections coming up in the not too distant future as an incredible that will raise cannabis at tremendous [noise] and I really think again this tremendous enthusiasm for the midterms will see look at four O. one case\nSo let's say we have a really bad\nTime in three weeks from now four oh one K. is going to go down tremendously people lose well\nIf they don't go out and\nThen they have themselves to land because they'll lose well\nDown do you agree that if the Democrats win the house\nAs the President's Day your ... will go down now is it possible anything's possible yeah\nDo you think they'll take a massive hit here's the other question that we want to ask you President Trump says he's not to blame if they lose the house but according to Brett Baer from special report the ... the Republicans may pick up more seats almost fifty three possibly fifty four seats and the U.S Senate way\nFrom the mid term elections and as we look at the situation for the house\nWe can tell you that Democrats continue to hold the vantage and the generic congressional polling Fox News pulling team looking and race to race across the country says election were held today the house would likely lead\nTo the Democrats now our latest poll just out today shows that Democrats maintain a seven point advantage on that national number\nBut when it comes to enthusiasm Republicans have picked up on the ground in recent weeks\nAmong likely voters democratic enthusiasm as you see here is also jumped as well\nNow he points out again when you look at the polls right now among some of the congressional districts that came close they voted for Hillary and butter for President Trump but very closely allied but guess what area and the Republicans do better than the Democrats\nTake a look at the races for US Senate and where we are as it stands right now tonight on this is the scenario with Republicans at fifty one Democrats have forty nine\nElection were held today and all the candidates for US Senate held on even small leaves that they have an average of recent polls Republicans tonight with pickup Missouri and North Dakota\nEverything else instead of saying no other changes they pick up a net to see fifty three forty seven\nSo there you said the Republicans actually pick up more in the U.S Senate according to Brett Baer here's the question of Trump says he's not to be blamed but they lose the house but yet you to get credit if they win the Senate\nThe president is probably going to take credit any place you can it's just a personality but the fact of the matter is that you know the the pay maybe people want to have a little bit of checked everybody like some of the things he's doing\nI don't ... I don't really see clear water anymore can this be a turnaround\nWell you're absolutely right you all the public is outrage right now that they can no longer fish recreate you know we have closed beaches when we have algal blooms or now a affecting our ability to enjoy our or outdoor activities on the weekend and these issues come back to us\nThat come back to our government's how are we uh\nUh planning for gross or are we doing smart growth always stopping pollutants from going in the environment and the answer is really no so what we've done over the past three or four decades as we have overbuilt Florida with the unsustainable development work looting it to death and as a result\nPlaces to any member looking a southwest Florida the Florida Keys are no longer what they used to be these are the the banner gemstones in state of Florida which attract this year to come move and that is to be around clean water to enjoy and recreate on and we no longer have that as you pointed out\nEnvironmental scientists Dr Peter ... and the students with his only talk I Want to clarify this when we talk about pollution that's included for pesticides that are going off and has a runoff correct as well it's not it's not like we're talking about a man just purposely doing this it just takes place when you want to have more of an expansion it's going to happen\n[noise] true but we need to be very smart about a pollution and the environment or we\nHow do you mean how ... how do you become smart about it\nWell number one you know we have to have good science and we have to put it into policy and let me give you an example in two thousand eight oh we enacted a state law for mitigating fertilizer and its effect on uh the Jason groundwater surface waters the point being that we had to go into an education program number\nOne and tell people that how to properly apply fertilizer because they don't you're not\nSaying you can't do it just properly do it the right way that's correct\nThat's number one but the other side of it is as I point out with waste water you know we have not invested in tour or a wastewater infrastructure in urban areas we have every time we have hurricane ... through a for instance in ... and we had twenty million gallons of sewage dumped into the lagoon\nOh we continue to have sewage dumping breaking lines we are about a half a billion dollars behind and upgrading our wastewater infrastructure on any Republican and we believe this is directly related to\nThe outbreaks of brown tide loss of fisheries and\nLoss of recreation opportunity to your point I have those um in the pesticide business um that pass control and they they they listen to the show and they will email me they will call me up going you know\nEverybody always wants to blame us but he says we told them like what you said he says ... ... if we have people that live on the river whether it's in Jacksonville northeast Florida or down for example beginning a Republican from pollution down the Fort piers whatever [noise] um\nThey say hey as you pointed out Dr braille do it in a very common sense he says these people can only half acre on the river and in the past controlled ... they're dumping a holy acre where the pesticide ... is running in the water one\nOf the things we did with the fertilizer ordinance was we made sure that the commercial applicators ah were properly license and\nTo your point uh you know anybody can go to a box store and buy wheat and feed and over apply it so to your point they're adding to much nitrogen phosphorus and they're adding to much ah you know ... and pesticides stuff that will negatively affect\nPlants and animals in the water when they over apply it so you're correct\nSo if there is a turnaround how do you ... I mean how do you turn it around to make the water much clearer northeast Florida central Florida as well\nOkay first of all we must invest in urban infrastructure uh again we have cities are like uh probably Jacksonville uh you know going through transitions with its utilities they have got to make a a improvements are in the quality of their infrastructure went around and so you have hurricanes dumps too it's not\nTo interrupt you what you're talking about is new sewage pipes and drainage pipes\nFor some reason why which they've been taught out for twenty to Thirty years even Miami talks about the level waters that are rising but yet they also pointed out if you could find it because we've covered it on his radio show they also made one of the reasons why there's water coming into the roads that they haven't had a good enough job of their sewage drainage are draining sewage and things like that as well see that's a big reason why for clean water\nSure up in cities like Miami Dade county's ah like Broward all the way up to the Palm Beach is of since the Nineteen fifties they've had seven sewage out falls literally ... beach dumping about four hundred million gallons of sewage\nAnd how old is too which is I mean the the the drainage pipes or what but still around for thirty forty years\nThey were put in there and I think that season here we are the twenty Eighteen or like a third world country dumping sewage literally one mile of some of the most visited beaches on the planet\nBut yet they're always telling you that you need ... you need to revamp the septic tank\nAs you know government very good about ... brings down to the common person yet they won't take our tax money invest it properly and keep our clean or our coastal waters plane that's a real issue\nYou or a policy guy but I've got to ask you the politics when when you bring this up you've done this before he talked about on TV or research on radio when you made this issue what what is the typical defense by your local county ... county commissioner the reason why they haven't revamped their so they they can't tell me having enough money I'd gotten billions of dollars\nYou can measure the reason why they have it a revamped their so they they can't tell me I haven't had the money they've gotten billions of dollars coming\nUnfortunately they often say we don't have enough ... but again it's how they spend it and I think we're going to see some leadership emerging particularly alone any Republican that's recognizing the the money has been miss invested in misspent and we must make cleaning up the pollution and getting the infrastructure correct if we want to have clean water in the future\nI got about a minute and a half left this has become a political issue governor Rick Scott Iran disadvantages to kill 'em an end to build a bell Nelson race ... is the is the attitude winning that somehow again as you point out with the pollution mixed up with Mother Nature creates a big big atmosphere that problem in the ... the political atmosphere\nBut then again is everybody thinks that this is the government's fault they haven't done enough about this and yet somehow it somehow blame the government here like governor wrecks out like that you haven't done it with the right time and you keep pointing out this is not a man they product\nNot me I just I mean there was a mandate solution may be but it's all based on Mother Nature\nWell let's be clear you know we have not been responsible about the way we develop in the state of Florida and so we have had a series of a ... leadership administrations in this state that have not been responsible enough to dealing with mitigating septic tanks\nA leaky sewer pipes and job we have this is a legacy of the state of Florida where the protection has been taken out of the department of environmental protection we're not protected our coastal waters and it goes well beyond the politics state and local\nPits the regulatory regime in a state that is governed by politics by already the people and we make our local and state elected officials of the response to this uh hopefully they will invest a our tax money and try to widely problems\nEnvironmentalist or environmental scientist Dr Peter out good to have you in the studio today male students again thank you add more as we continue to move along right here on TALK

there is pollution going on out there but he's exactly correct that\nThe municipalities have not we still have septic tanks forty to fifty years old but yet the government locally tells you that you

the not too distant future as an incredible they're already talking about that the tremendous [noise] and I really think again this tremendous enthusiasm for the midterms will see\nLooking for one case so let's say we have a really bad\nTime in three weeks from now four O. one K. is going to go down tremendously people going to lose well\nIf they don't go out and\nThen they have themselves to blend\nIf they don't go out and\nThen they have themselves and land\nArea guys as they don't go out and then they have themselves to blame triple to talk nine zero for triple to eight to five five before we get to the calls and\nJust reported by Roger Anderson one of the other big news stories this morning\nHigh ranking or former high ranking Republicans are telling other Republicans especially here in Florida jump on board the [noise] with hunted today when you sit high ranking that's right okay Mary Jo wanna debate former house Speaker John Boehner who is against us\nNow is one of the biggest supporters because why he's a lobbyist he says quote it's unstoppable the economic revolution is about to kick in high gear they call it the next\nGreen gold rush Fox News the latest on what's

potency of different marijuana products that will be out there\nDifferent marijuana products that will be out there but he's just a federal issue or a state's rights issue ask when it comes to it Cory Gardner the Republican senator from Colorado\nThousands of jobs at risk\nMillions of dollars in revenue\nAnd certainly the question of constitutional states' rights\nVery much at the core of this discussion [noise]\nNah so there you go triple to talk triple to eight to five by Chris good morning on WB obey\nGood morning guys I've got two things that I don't hear coming out of anyone's mouth that should bring a moment of parts the first thing is if politicians are chopping at the bit and rare and to go with the program\nEveryone should stop white there that should tell you enough that you need to know because they're just seeing dollar signs\nIn second thing which is more pressing is two words unintended consequences\nI I've never done drugs so I don't know but do we want a third of the people on the twenty percent of the people on the road a driving on marijuana\nWhat what does that do to people is that like people on alcohol I don't know the question I'm asking it back to you but to be a lot of unintended consequences that are kind of come out of the wash for this green gold mine that people are gonna realize after the fact that maybe that wasn't such a great idea but no one's thinking about it\nWhat about that for the here's my question for you ... ... is it a valid argument some would say well you talk about what whatever percentage as you may bring up about the issue of marijuana they could say well\nIs it quite equal to say that with the issue of Merrill or about the whole people being on the red with it\nWell\nI Know that obviously you know the police are on top of it it's very easy to see someone who's on on a who's a driving under the influence of alcohol [noise]\nAh and I think they actively work to catch people like that um I I don't know what people look like who are driving under the influence of marijuana\nAnd let's take a step further so we talked about people you guys talked about earlier people working there on a factory was heavy machinery and they're doing drugs um\n[noise] what's that going to do is that going to raise people's a business this year instead they might have people who are on on that sort of thing and and working equipment\nNow that that's what I gotta get run it that's a great question I think businesses will be exempted from that okay because again I don't know how far the laws may go but how do you tax it and how to regulate it Richard good morning you're on WB obey\nYeah I just wanted to say that I'm In Washington state where a a recreational marijuana is legal and um the people that I spoke to about a subject\nDid not want to go to the dispensaries they went to their regular pot dealer because it was less expensive so it's just the money grab for the government\nAnd I I ... you know what role do you make a ... ... it is a money grab I mean it's a monopoly even with the medical marijuana here in Florida when you've got John Banner telling other Republicans get on board because it's a economic\n... it's a green economic boom it's a gold rush that you may have some say that they you know this was an economic benefit for Republicans and Democrats and for the state of Florida ... ... yeah\nAnd we're not even thinking about the gateway potential of introducing kids to marijuana that young age when they get older they want\nAn heck I don't want to introduce adults to marijuana

B. O. B.\nVery good morning ed thank you for taking my call thank you for calling in\nListen I I feel very personal about this uh my sister was killed by a driver and head on collision or less three young children all under eight years old or we always did it it was in the middle of the night and he was passing or my sister was a nursery returning home from the late shift\nUm but the police or didn't have any way to test to see if the guy was actually high so I I'm not against legalization I think it's coming we can't stop it there's big money involved in who are we but the people to make our decision so it it it's coming\nBut uh I Would just love to see the people that are pushing it pushes\nTommy but uh I Would just love to see the people that are pushing it pushes hard that police officers can have a way to catch someone hey have you been smoking pot low in the you know is that so hard\nI don't think so we'll have officers can do that ... can I can find on the I don't don't under seller boys in blue or they know exactly who was under the influence of drugs\nWhen they pull them overt rounded I've got people call it in um the ... the Republicans out there to have an edible it's going to happen to me based on culture but\nThey are talking as an economic I hear this with gambling I like a minute three coming around I hit those was offshore drilling and all the extra amount of money they're already emailing me today with all the medical medical but marijuana we tax it regulate it got more money lower property taxes is it the next green gold rushes even though the Republicans are saying\nUnless convinced for a couple of reasons first off no one is against looking at\nMarijuana cannabis whatever it's called this week\nFor medical applications to the problem is is that that's regulated by the food and Drug Administration marijuana is classified as a schedule one drug which means we can't even to test the F ... any of these various\nMap dates from the panhandle has a bill out there to rate classify it to reschedule it you'll probably see it three to five year process checking that out\nOf and then we will see what the approved uses her for at that point I think you'll see the feds retake control right now we're operating under a very interesting scheme\nThat was created under the Obama administration view Eric Holder was a it's based upon the green memo where we in essence or not enforcing federal law in the states\nWithout doing it with him in the sanctuary cities putting ... I Want I Want to get to the economic boom question is there a Bible excuse to sit back and say it could be an economic boom for taxpayers here in Florida\nTo an extent absolutely meat in Colorado there using some of that money for you know or their state budget in some purposes now there's been some argument that the money that's been going to schools isn't as much as was advertised but\nYeah you can take something that was legal and tax it and you know beef up your coffers then why not um you know it's not like there's a bunch of zombies running around the grill or I don't know\nWell what has always left out of that conversation is the related costs for the societal impact of the legalization scheme if you look at Colorado they don't say\nUm it's a tighter race than I think he anticipated given the money he's raised but yeah there's a lot of situations like what we're facing in Florida\nThe Gillum debate with Ron just than just takes place this Sunday is the issue of economics I mean the Santa some have said he's going to have to come out instead of calling them to point of Obama a socialist the most pro Israel\nOr you know we did a story for the daily dot com on the two economic proposals by that Andrew Gillum and then that of course it rather than just even if you want it to Jack up the corporate taxes\nYou still don't have enough money\nFor education teachers minimum wage Medicaid expansion and yet nobody from the right is running in the ads about that instead of running FBI investigation\nYeah I mean to say it is his whole campaign right now is built on smearing Andrew Gillum now he's been you know to say this has been you know in a couple of times for not giving specifics on his ... right right so hopefully in Tampa if you're a Republican you will hear some of those policy think that's the right way to go\nI think what matters right now is unwinding the voting issues and the nine counties that were hit by hurricane Michael I'm I think that is going to have a greater impact on the results of this election than anything that happens in the debate Sunday\nAnd interesting and yet uh some of the supervisor of elections says that they're going to have special polling places they are going out of the ways that people can vote that's good more people who vote the better area more and more Democrat or Republican it's\nThe most uh consistently Republican the area of the state\nUm especially from a margin basis but why and I've I've read the articles about the the mega sites and all that but here's the real issue there are people that have yet to be found yeah there are people that have de camp to North Carolina New Orleans and all that they can't come home because they don't\nHave a well do I know how those numbers not huge that can't be found I think it's within a hundred and I don't think that's going to swing of Florida last show when you're\nDealing with statewide races that typically have a margin of about two points either way it's significant and you're like the fact that Andrew Gillum is the first African American candidate for governor from a major party he is going to have a significantly increased turnouts a\nAmongst younger folks and amongst African Americans and you add all that together and it makes it a very thinly sliced\nMatching the spin if it's all based on the panhandle lower amount of turn out to vote\nThat if let's say just stance is wins oh blame Trump for global warming does a connoisseur hurricane they didn't get enough people do get to you know displaced would've ... who did the Republicans blame now they blame themselves for not you know supporting and putting them I guess I don't I'm not going to be an exaggeration candidate who had the policy answers\nI Know yeah but no one was anticipating now Gillum no that's not at all no one is built to campaign in the primary to run against\nThere are Gillum no that's not at all no one is built to campaign in the primary to run against Andrew Gillum tripled to talk nine zero for tripled to eight to five five David good morning Ron W.
