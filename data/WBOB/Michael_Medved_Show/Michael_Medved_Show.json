I've said all the way back to the uh\nBeginning formation of this country or a big central big federal central government versus a smaller a central government has been the debate that's gone on for two hundred and forty years now and uh when you look now into modern times\nUh liberalism over the last forty fifty years sixty years in this country Seventy years and go back to Social Security has been about a bigger government role in providing for all\nTo the point now where we are at a uh a guaranteed income\nA free health care\nFree college and now baby bonds already talked about last week yeah taking care of you from cradle to grave not help not just helping those who truly need it\nBut making it so all because the the uh\nCriminal here six thousand dollars of the guaranteed income I

the rich a hundred percent of their income ... even if you're taxed a hundred ...\nIt's a hundred percent of their income ...\nEven if you're taxed a hundred percent of it you're still not going to still not going to be able to get what you want a up for it so it's not sustainable\nBut that's one thing having that debate for Thirty years we have had that debate for Thirty years roughly we've had

running against governor Abbott here in Texas I haven't seen any commercials\nThat are explained to him that you don't run many commercials you're not going to going to get major backing from any

have a chance\nSo I don't know yeah I I don't know why they think that I'd like to see why and and and unless you could say you've seen the polls closing\nBecause ... was up by nine the middle of a you know just a two weeks ago and and a couple of days later okay he was only up by five okay there was just a day difference so I'm really not a lot you're talking about a couple of days difference there was momentum there\nHasn't been a poll since the sixteenth so I don't know if they see something that ... in there and turtles right we haven't seen yet yeah I'd love\nTo know what they're seeing them um that that would be very interesting that would be very interesting uh some very close races though right now in the Senate\nI I think you know you you look at those and and you would

I'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nOh I'm trying to say is that it seems to me a as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you don't have a ton of conservative friends Republican friends we're all brothers we're all brothers what I'm saying is that\nIt seems to me the trunk and the way he characterizes\nPeople who are in need\nThe rise is people who are in need and if you were in their position if you were in their same position you want the best for your family you want you would want the best for your friends you you would want the best for yourself you want the best life it seems to me\nThat you're in an okay but what is not in the last ... after that we're in gestures guilty okay well let me we're ... we're using language is characterized by right well here's not here to energy it's here's the point is ugly right now that people are dying in my opinion ... okay are you people are dying as a result of\nHatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left as justice guilty\nOkay here's the saints here's a point that I Want to get too because you this is very important because one of the things that that really gets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that and I believe that that the that the yanks when we're we've got some\nInterference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate I\nBelieve Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top\n... example [laughter] you know the example I'm going to give\nHim keeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's one heck of an allegation so we understand that when it comes to hyperbole he can go over the top\nBut don't you care about the substance\nIsn't only the hyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrats are Democrats only care about how you say it's not what you say\nAnd you also have to understand when it comes to the theory that exist in America\nBy a lot of people including Trump when you see the Democrats wish to protect illegal immigrant criminals this is not ultra partisan to get people angry it is the reality of what exists today dating reality is not hate talk\nBut when you have the Democrats who prefer their preference is the safety and security of illegal immigrant criminals over American citizens yeah you're going to get people angry including the president mhm\nYup what's gonna happen I'm a look and by the way the whole thing with the remember the president said the rapist thing and you know it's it's you know you and I for example we've said you could take quotes that we have said\nAnd and you know in the context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as that was said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people tried to come across the border we can't do it so we clarified that a long long time ago in fact be clarified that right after it happened yes\nBut again it was or what they did was they took it and they ran with it at all or rapists and no\nYou said all he said rapists\nWell and he didn't say they were all rape is won't name across it and and ... changed and making the point the very simple point that we have to that every single person that comes in this country that was the point he was making\nYes\nBecause does the most hardened criminals are the ones you don't want to hear\n\nVery simple or something I'd like to go point by point with our last caller to find out just how liberal you are\nBecause you have to understand where liberalism ... or ... you know again and you can tell at least he conceded he was conceding some points\nA\nBy the way I did see over the weekend we need a third political party everything here proves that that would stand for what\n\nYeah what are you going to both of us are going to promote what what was the third political party stand for well where's the center\nWhere's the center yeah who's really a moderate right now\nI don't know what a monitor it is right now you know we've been you know over the past few years especially over the past twenty four months we've been trying to define what a conservative is a think we all know what the liberalism there are varying degrees of liberalism but it starts\nPretty much on the foreign left and then goes to the extreme far left\nWell tell me what a moderate is forget about conservative or liberal tell me what a moderate is one of the stand for what do they promote and how they vote\nAnd I've talked about how I uh talked to a a relative by marriage who was a college professor and knew he was a liberal I mean I really never got into the conversation and did this year at our family reunion and even though he's a liberal he rejects what's coming from the Democrats completely and he said about Trump said\nThose look my dad loved Trump because Trump look his rhetoric has over the top but not a racist he's done you said come on is in New York City deals with everybody and this guy's a liberal professor who says I Can't stand being on the liberal campus was he said because they're not liberal anymore now she would be in his fifties\nMhm so he might still be some of the old school liberal so that exist out there versus the new school liberals that are really have the mindset of a fascist right\nIf you want to get in lines are open eight six six

vote you had two or three that were dead on\nAs to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was ...\nAnd and so you know there are some polls that are better dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is pay wrong statement to make a lot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the sampling that they use\nA you know distort the way that America feels but some polls actually get it right it's just the fact that we don't know which of the polls to get it right before an election\nWe have to wait until after so we can look at the issues that are that are affecting at a you know another thing is and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election it may\nIf if it goes on for another two years and right and this is this is where uh I I call it\nA a Trump exhaustion and\nI've I've just clean that weren't just popped into my head right now and and it goes back to last week when I was on vacation and I go back to

I mean we've seen it he's a liar\nUm he's a he's the end and by the way these lawyers that have lined up against Trump you know he can go after them as a group and include ... in that and and there's a there's there's nothing wrong with that or he can go after them and\nBe I I mean that that's something that's an effective tactic that you know does work because it's true he doesn't have to make anything up I mean he he doesn't have to call anybody names\nYou call Evan Eddie a liar well that's just that's just truth or that the guy brought a nothing lawsuit against you it was baseless then you've got again you've\nGot something that if you go you go to go to the baseless lawsuit you go to the um uh you go to a a a cabin on and you say these are the people that are against me right and to me I I people say well what do you mean that's a ... well no that's a positive uh what came out ... of the news story that\nEvidence he lost a lawsuit against you or I Would say is it was a ... law suit and he's been doing this and look what he tried to do to destroy cabinet and at that point you get the political when\nRight there is a social media when for young people is that what you're looking for you're talking about again likely voter groups and those who are right now on the fence it if it's not a positive don't don't do it don't say it\nAnd there are plenty of positives that he can say you're wasting your time with anything else I mean [noise] jobs the economy by those\nThings would resonate with young people but whether it's going to get them to vote or not that's that's a you know we don't know but it certainly is a positive [noise]\nAh other affect the presidents of the past\nYou know you can show already a track record of getting things done that are helping the economy you\nKnow and and that's it and and and by the way I I Do want to um\nClarify you know we criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada alone on yesterday's show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we shouldn't Donald Trump started this good economy we shouldn't forget who started this all your right of\nMr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again you you you have those positives stay on them because what is a rally\nWhat is a rally a rally is a a ton of positives and this map the massive group of euphoric people that are ready to take action\nYou know that's that's where ... if you think about it every day on social media should be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positives you can go after Chuck Schumer writing buddy because\nI think it's very important to understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm\nAgainst the negative advertising this ridiculous right of course you have to point out one out so now you've got you've got to point out the negatives of your\nYou know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all the ... that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller have all solve crime may not right right well so that that that it then that's why I started ... ... I started laughing because\nYou know that has been going to happen you have to point out and and I believe at times you have to get blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during the cabinet hearing said it's unacceptable to us and we'd been blunt that you're not an American\nThat if you ... if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for capital\nYou know they were ... Democrats are trying to we use a lot of that in every well [laughter] it's it's not accord a lot it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political court that\nHad much of the same enforcement mechanisms that are criminal court has\nWhen you testify right and and so a a a a person's reputation is at stake it was a political court and yes\nAmericans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact that they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence if you're\nNot on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away\nAny pretense of carrying about Americans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabinet hearings we don't care we point out in a very passionate way as you can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well I you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody there not a patriot because they believe they're a patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American if we want makes you want to America and it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you if you reject\nThe second amendment if you reject a due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject it\nAnd and you wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say you right it's it's not and people said well it's a shocking thing that you're saying\nNo it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming what do you believe in America or just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes that's that's it I'm you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech will know you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nThat free speech oh no no no see your free speech as bigoted your freedom of religion as bigoted and\nAnd so no we believe me we believe in negative you know this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter] what the opposition is for and what they really stand for and\nThe fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them and you can proudly say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country ...\nBecause they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so yeah nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have the way in the\n... move onto the next when well again I Want\nTo win for calling out a a war or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting\nAnd saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do in such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy and look what they want to do with it\nAnd it went back to and and the other end by the way and sometimes the name calling the the slogan name calling or the nickname calling is very effective [laughter] liar Lanny I\nNow I made that went up I don't know I don't know how to use the ones I I don't want to get ... was uh what was it\nI don't know when you when when you start when he said sure I forgot what it was just ... yeah and I bought a used somebody's got those listed somewhere over ... ... no ... we said this though well now it's poodle people in office it's running it's beautiful tired of that is not lying to any more [laughter]\n[laughter]\nAnd as far as we know the president no longer believes that Mr Cruz's father so involved in the ass [laughter] as far as we know about but but look I'm we said before I thought one of the greatest\nUm in terms of theatrics but have a point to something solid was him sitting at that table with an empty seat\nAnd an end the name of of of publicity on one

effective\nThey're not showing up they're not here at the party I'm trying to work with them they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes because it's real simple it's it's brilliant\nPolitical moment yes because it's real simple it's it's brilliant and its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represented\nKeep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill to come in and that that's not promote\nThat's from Chris Matthews he didn't

day before election day in twenty sixteen my answer would be yes because they did afterwards\nEverything that went on for the you know the next year and a half\nDo they today is the is the anger\nBuild their to motivate\nThe Democrats\nTo get out because remember there really is you know we talked about\nThis this president is\nI every president has unique and every Republican president we forget because people will say nobody has ever been attacked like Donald Trump before\nWe forget that Bush was called not see the only thing is the difference between a Bush and they Donald Trump is which never fought back\nSo if you fight back then the rhetoric coming back and she was going to increase ... but the rhetoric was still there was just as bad if you're ... ... ... remember the protests started his ranch in Texas yeah in central Texas ... it was everything\nThey were hanging I'm an effigy they read everything he was Hitler he was\nA ... and as Bill Maher said well yeah we called Bush and the and Romney and all those you know we called them Hitler but they really weren't but ... and they just move on and then there will be the next Republican president that gets in and what did they decide to fight back whenever that is\nEither that or what if what if a Republican actually named Hitler runs one day but like I didn't\n[laughter] I\nI'm trying to think if there is is there a politician in American aimed at where I'm I'm guessing if that's your name you you might want to change it and most have\nBut um but this is the he's a tactic and yes from the left that's the tactic and if you engage they're going to engage even further and we see that that that's very evident now\nI'm with this current brought it but as we've said with with Trump Trump visited them with what he's actually done and it's interesting because I had a discussion last week with a friend that I've known for Thirty years now\nAnd she claims that she's a liberal whenever I talk to her I find the she agrees much more with me that that it surprises me when we ... we only see each other once every couple of years we sat down we had to talk\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans so United and I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much ... ah back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine so uh you know I wasn't as observant\nOr you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time I was greatly United but over an issue\nI in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party being as United when they were more fractured than I'd seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of people over Kavanaugh\nThat to me that to me deal is the biggest unknown\nAs to how much it will drive Republicans to the polls if it is what I think it is\nOr what I suspect it couldn't be if it actually is that I think the Republicans could hold the house if it's not their own ... right right yeah\nUm and and again all the things that we've talked about the factors of you know what's going on in the Midwest and and what's going on with the you know if ... if that's affecting enough

Berkeley I'm not on the health care but on border control they would say\nNo people should be able to come and go as they please\nBecause if I'm wrong well then the left needs to call me out on it\nAnd this is the other thing I Would I Would start doing that on debate stage I Would start doing that if you're the president if I'm if I'm the president go out there in and say that every route\nThey want they're promoting people being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country as they please say that over and over again and have the media fact check it for you\n\nBecause then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left ...\n... ... and this device I'd get to the president as Mr President people already know what you think and forget about what have you ever wish you ... everybody's asking you about the reporters continue to ask you what you think\nYou've got to turn it around yes what America needs to know is not what you think on a legal immigration or American thing sign a legal immigration you need to get an answer out of Democrats as to what they think so win or lose it's still going to be an issue\nOr ... I mean winter lose the house and joins ... it's still going to be an issue take it to the Democrats mhm\nThey force you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration you better come clean you've talked about it how many hundreds of times and the press is act you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the major discussion on really since I'm a\nKennedy McCain yeah yeah since really ... when William was that was\nThat two thousand eight two thousand no no no it was before ... it was two thousand gosh to know that was ...\nIt was before you came on board no was while we're doing the show became Kennedy was yeah we were in Arlington studios okay\nYeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling scam dusty um yes it was because it was two thousand aids\nWas two thousand and it was it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here was one of our personnel and\nAnd then then it would have been the following year or maybe later that year when it after it went away that McCain had to go to the um\nUh the uh he was that the conservative a convention and and had to essentially they said he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that ah he realized that the rest of America was not on board with\n\nThat uh and it fell short on a ... eleven days after I started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I gather together on the air and that's why I say because I ... I was out here I was so low I remember going weeks on that and uh and I was so low and I was and so\nThe ... the but\nThis has been going on for a long long time if you think about it and I almost did this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy to day\nMight have a better chance than it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now\nIf you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh uh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it\nNot from conservative so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... [laughter] and then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote it\nBut it's been over Thirteen Years that this has been a huge issue huge issue is that's really what kick started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans have not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit this is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders and that's what they want and if they don't want it\nThen tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you passed as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold\nAs a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold right that's a fair question to ask\nAre you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform of border enforcement or do they want to open borders we can come to any type of compromise if we don't know what they want right and do it and get it on eight six six Ninety right I\nWant to do for your goals six six months he wrote

it being Fifteen days out uh I think for a mid term or the Republicans are in really good shape now normally in a midterm you're going to have the party in power like the Republicans yeah they're going to lose seats\nMm I'd that's what that's what normally happens or in in a case like this ah of course we live in unique times and every election is completely and totally unique I I look at what the Republicans have right now\nThe uh Republicans have right now the economy\nRight the economy is doing the\nUh the economy's doing good uh and that is huge you had the cabin on hearings where America has seen\nThat there are major major things that are important to many Americans that they now understand that the Democrats do not believe in and we talked about the cabinet and forget about the Supreme Court ... what it showed was that depending on their politics\nThat the Democrats do not believe in a presumption of innocence right or the mindset of due process\nAnd we set up back at that at you know at that time a few weeks ago said look we understand\nThat when it comes to a lot of things out there on the for example on the the ... a separation of powers and the three branches of government and the rights that are included in the first amendment to the constitution of the majority of Americans can't tell you what they are\nBut when you look at what is ingrained in our culture and one of the reasons is the ... the TV shows on lawyers all the way back to Perry Mason or the presumption of innocence and due process\nThe mindset of due process is ingrained into every single American so we saw that with Kavanaugh\nAnd we saw the reaction of\nMany people realizing that not the fringe of the Democratic party but the mainstream of the Democratic party has now jumped

have a field that is going to be greater than it was what did they have three three and a half candidates go up against Trump\nNo but if you in their primary or a ... well build me a heck of a lot more I I I well I don't know I I I'm not gonna you know you you have to and you said this earlier it's going to be\nEither who hates Trump more than a combination of\nWho hates Trump more and we're going to give you everything right and so right now the base level for the Democrats have been ... over the weekend ... last week\nWhen she came up again with her guaranteed in a ... plan yeah of six thousand dollars was one of the figures that was thrown out so now it's get will on the Braves pitching gum you first get rid of the the tax cuts\nRight they act taxes would have to go up there in order to pay for it even though they ... it wouldn't pay for the six thousand dollars and but six thousand dollars what any American the mix under a hundred thousand something like that what it was I I'm\nA but the ... six thousand they're free healthcare completely Medicare for all where you pay nothing there's no deductible there is nothing mhm\nWhich ah by the way uh I thought the president had the best response for that before we went on vacation when he said\nGood screw people than that right because what's going to happen right you you you you think you're going to Medicare for all you can just going to enter a screen old people because they're not enough money for the old people that have put in for Medicare that we can't pay for Medicaid for them right\nUh but uh you know so you have you have that and free college free college free health care free money mhm\nAnd we hate Trump and really if you want to look at it there was nowhere else for them to go that route it we already know what twenty twenty is going to be yeah yep\nIt's because there has to be again that that battle on stage to you know who hates Trump more poor or now will just kind of usher in this this thought and entertain this for a moment\nOkay maybe it is Hillary or maybe it is Joe just anyone that can beat Trump\nExcept there has to be more than that there really has to be more than that because what you're looking at at the end of the day or on election day\nIs what's going on with the economy and and what are they really promising and and do I ... I Know a lot of people have Trump but I didn't vote for the guy I may not ever vote for the guy but I\nAm I'm motivated to go out and vote for this person what are they gonna do for me you're talking about other sports were just talking about rank and file voters rank and file voters right because what did you see Wall Street journal going through Harlem and the than the day after the election and twenty sixteen why do you think he was\nJust you know random participants on the street interviews and the the one common thread in those and those respond as from those respondents was when he was talking about problems we have here at home\nShe kept talking about problems over seas somewhere outside of this country all as we said\nThe reason the Trump one was not because he had all the solutions but because he simply identified what the problem was\nWhat the problems ...\nAnd the fact is you haven't had presidential candidates that have looked at the topics that people have cared about\nAnd even point out these are the problems and we have to solve them and that's how bad it had gotten by twenty six team as we said the Democrats were talking about instill our climate change and race are two major problem ... well they're not riding Americans didn't deal with that way right from is president because\nHe identified what the problems were and now we can debate all day long whether all of the solutions that he has come up with\nOr that he has promoted or the correct way to go or not ... but the fact is he came up with the problems and identified the problems and politics are so bad in America today\nWhere if you just identified the problem in twenty sixteen that got you elected president of the United states right\n\nAnd then what you have now is two years later you've got a ton of people looking at the same and you know something a lot of the solutions are the correct solutions mhm\nYeah I mean that's in and that's it it because what you have to deliver in order to be reelected for a second term just results\nSo if we're still looking at low unemployment and we're still looking at you know the people taking more money home because taxes are lower if we're still looking at a situation where the economy is getting better\nThan where\nDo you go you can offer free stuff what's that going to look like ultimately you're going to have to spell out how it's going to work\nAlternately you're gonna have to you know I mean\nWe say what you will about Herman Cain's nine nine nine plan but guess what people still say the the name of the plan now we torn apart and it didn't work and ultimately didn't work for him but the point is is that you come out with something very simple here's how my plan is going to work\nHere's what I Want to do while you're up against potentially a president in twenty twenty who has delivered some pretty stellar results on the economy\nSo you're going to do what promised a lot of free stuff do people still buy the hype in the free stuff if they believe that will never be delivered ultimately\nBanned because here's what changed after the great recession and we saw this it was well the banks got the bail out so I should get mine even people that otherwise might be conservative you know we're like okay we want we do want more free stuff we got a ton of those calls and and so there is\nThat affect their but the concern is too is that amongst\nThe you know just the generic voter population out their rank and file voter\nThey're looking at as a this big promise oh free health care for everybody free whatever it's going to be the big free package and they say to themselves you know what it will be free for somebody else and it won't be free from me\nThey they compare themselves to their neighbor or somebody else and it's like now I just got to end this good economy I just got to making this amount of money and guess what they're promising something to somebody else I'm not going to get any of that [noise] your calls and comments coming\nI'm a ... something to somebody else I'm not going to get any of that [noise] your calls and comments coming up eight six six Ninety\nRight I Want to do

I still believe that it wouldn't have back then because in taxes remembered twenty sixteen in the primary he won the state he won Texas\nOr he also won Iowa a but but\nThere may be may be could have been something where a Ted Cruz would have lost to a ... a back there and and again we don't make predictions would just look at the polls right now and and Ted Cruz has a fairly comfortable lead and it's over fifty\nIn the most recent polls\nAnd were what two weeks in a day out\nSo something would have to happen between now and then to change those falls about saying it couldn't but it would have to be a pretty decent shift to make up for that lost ground which would mean typically get outside the margin of error that's going to have to be a a seven to ten points swing\nIn favor of Beto O'Rourke and there's nothing working in that direction\nBut but I but you just ask yourself the question here based on what the rock star based on what\nUh I you know I I I don't know and I and I look at I look at a ... if you just if I Do cook analysis of the\nThe new the a\nIs no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go to the Senate needs to go ... what they don't understand that those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are is to protect the rights of the minority this\nTo protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claim that they they think about\nSo we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that about ... got responds all it's a bubble thing that he loves American we don't know based on\nThe actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting mhm what we're calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution well yeah and we can make that point and you and I said for the longest time\nBut it's still left that doesn't believe in the first amendment oh for them yeah mhm but for others they don't and we broken that down before they don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence that mindset is wrong\nAnd we've talked about that you know the support of the judges when the judge has become activists judges and how that is on American and unconstitutional and how they promote that mhm\nAnd so the average person I think she is at and Trump is anything they look at ... and I look at Trump and you look at Trump is anything but an authoritarian and a fascist even at times though his words we like it don't say that\nYeah I ... when you look at what he actually doesn't what he promotes in the long run it's\nAll constitutional yes it's all part of the process that was put in\nPlace hundreds of years ago\nI mean it it's but this is this is what we have to this is what it has to come down to if we're not going to win the Senate we need to get rid of it\nThat we're not going to win the electoral college vote then you're ready to get rid of it we need to get rid of the constitution wanted Dustin when it does or on me when we don't win the White House we need to get rid of the presidency that's anti American\nYes\nNo it's not well what America are you for ... it's not America where they don't like it was on the constitution if we don't have the form of government that we have that it's no longer America\nWhat do you believe in besides the Fifth Amendment [laughter]\nBesides exactly an eight six six Ninety read I [noise]\nWas ready to do with a record ...

radio he is currently and I'm hearing back tomorrow we'll get to more of your calls and comments coming up following the bottom of the hour up but I I thought it's important\nTo bring that up because that's more of the the emotion of what drives an election but I and I don't think I don't think we should discount how important that is in this election that reason the Trump is drawing the crowds that he is is drawing\nA especially from a Republican Party that you'd think two years afterwards\nThat he's going in and doing these rallies and he is drawing these people and we had mentioned the the uh the the story that came out over the weekend that Tibet O'Rourke a small little theater\nHe couldn't fill that here in the state of Texas just a couple of weeks out is was reported over the weekend that the real rock star even though we hate that term for politicians to begin with\nBut the real rock star still is Trump and why because there is an emotional attachment to him that is based on the substance of what he's doing\nAnd that's what that's what it comes down to it also how the left is behaving in reaction to have elected behaving in and that type of threat that that poses if you think of the what happened during the capital confirmation process\nYou know so that's that's what it comes down to what's the greater motivator on each side and will seat and a couple of weeks for video road logging here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there is a low

yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented\nNothing nothing we've ever seen a ... in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that\nTo me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity means a lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up and said that didn't happen with so tomorrow and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we\nUp and said that didn't happen with so tomorrow and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe that sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the with\nThe cell tower right the cell tower cases the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know that ah they use the in their writings they used um\nPrior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia is exactly that was the press and the right they use but in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate\nWhich is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was based on traditionally what they would do not by what we want each and every day mhm mhm but\nWhat the job of the judges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole Kavanaugh hearings that we should look ... you know conservatives and Republicans stop have to stop arguing\nThe same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republicans keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice and what not and\nI'm not voting for a conservative judge I'm voting for a construction is an originalist I'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to be each and every day understand that their role is not to make law either left or right\nThere their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says\nYou know it's interesting too is that as we got to the uh the the closer to the the ultimate vote on on a capital you know I made the point that even the liberal justices\nRespect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you could look at\nOne judgment you can look at from SCOTUS was recess appointments which was ... yeah against all by against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear\nOn what the process yes and so respecting not only the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process\nAt the highest court I Do believe and you know you can say what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or or whether they're dissenting or majority opinion\nYou can we can tear it apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we

Montana governor Steve bullock a you know the obvious ones from Pocahontas or to Joe Biden to a Spartacus Booker\nTo Kamala Harris probably leave you know call mall I'm leaving some people out who would you like who's nice who do you have a Bernie Sanders in the same 'cause that that's what I suggested to a caller\nI think I could sit down with Bernie I have a coke or something like that with him and there's nothing we would agree on me seems like a nice guy but the caller was talking to was a nod nod never could sit down with him\nUm so that's the second question is there anybody in the other side no matter what side you're I could you sit down with Donald Trump I actually heard he's a nice guy that he's got a different persona\nI don't get mad at me I'm not saying it's not a nice guy that I don't support his views when it comes across pretty bombastic and right\nSo there's lots of things and maybe some of us wish you wouldn't say but they say he's very soft spoken in in in a private he's really nice I Know people I met him and he sounds different so no matter which side you're on could you sit down and be friendly the way of mentioned last night that Ronald Reagan did with the former speaker of the house Tip O'Neill\nThey would have drinks on a friday night or whatever and Reagan was surprised that they would even to Tip O'Neill would be so of viciously against him during the daytime and he said well that's the time but it's gotten so bad now that we can acknowledge that maybe someone on the other side is okay I made if if um\nThey appear to me Cory Booker I mean what a phony what is so full of himself even made it you remember he made that up about he's going to divulge some information even though he's gonna get prosecuting knew he was and they just had gotten a memo or something from McConnell or the other leaders saying he can go ahead and talk about it\nAnd Kamala Harris line of stuff about her why what a phony what another ... or so I understand that some of them [noise]\nIt'd be hard to sit down with it and I don't know much about mayor gr city but\nI'm not impressed by him but maybe some of them you could sit so I'd like to hear that to eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine who could you be friendly with and number one question was who would you like to see run against President Trump matter what side you're on\n[noise] so let's go now to a show in Scranton, Pennsylvania you're on was mark\nI Joe Hi Mark how's your goal show for real well\nGood I'm like the last couple of nights are they like a lot of what you say you have to ... exception to one thing that you brought up um wouldn't delivery Clinton um you shut it it'd be bad for the country\nEach was a determination to get the job done\nWhen you carry inside is more valuable than\nBecause it's what's inside\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know and the records America's most red trucking business\nNow every week and watch me and my co host Jessica Rose as we bring you the only weekly news show green and just joined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry\nAlong with an awesome regularly profile that trucker dot com is the one you're not going to want to have you traveled down the highway so tune in every week and watch the news channel by going to the record dot com\nOr young radio Williams I haven't read one of ... million Americans ... disease there is no known cure\nThat you have the power to help the change that life right dissipating in a clinical trial Michael J.

I guess or someone is administration will allow that and the rules and speaking of ah who you'd like let's go and see who felt likes in Cleveland Philip Iran with mark\nMark really mean to you know I Want to first of all sorts of ... refer somebody was said while ago about if a\nTrump or out and dance game vice president that the speaker of the house will become much president that's not the way it works speaker of the house is second in line to the President's Day after the uh the by spread\nActually thirty he's thirty right after vice president you may not have heard me I corrected that in the last hour just didn't want to get robbed him at the time I live near\n... and which also would would would scare me a little bit if Nancy Pelosi was speaker of the house so that would really be a a scary thing of what happened but uh you know we talk about the Democratic nominee you know a Joe Biden\nHe had a copy the speech of new Cannick a British\nThat was yeah I mentioned to plagiarize ... yeah I Do remember that in\nAlmost word for word there I'll tell you who I who I Would and I'm I'm a conservative but I Do I Would think would would be a good person to run on the Democratic side would be a\n\nWe lose and he he's a former secretary the navy ... Republican president\nHe's a former structure the navy ... and a ... ...\nWho is that we didn't we didn't catch you you you you got cut off who was that\nWas Jim Webb\nWhen I was a former governor and he's a former U.S secretary of the navy and uh\nI just I don't think he would have a chance to ... the Democrat Party is so\nMove away from men like him Sam ... was the former senator that I could have voted for looked at seriously as a presidential candidate even though I'm I'm I'm not a Democrat but ... but\nHe he wouldn't even be acceptable to the Democratic party but I Am someone I Would like ... ... he he's a good man as\nAs interesting and is it would work across the aisle sincerely and to do things he worked for a Republican president as sex or the ...\nOf the people who announced could you pick one of them to sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nOh yeah I Love to have a ... who Bernie Sanders\nI think it would be a more so I Would enjoy that I wouldn't do anything you would if he would let me call and if he was listening and then and then and not\nYou know not just a demagogue everything I I like him his personality I don't want you to me that he believes in but uh\nIt would be ... ... ...\nDo you know what Lindsey Graham said about you know what Lindsey Graham said about Bernie Sanders a little I always have these stories of Bernie Sanders got married in a Soviet Union and some people think he never came back\n[laughter] that's funny so it is\nBut I thought you know it's like hey Philip thanks for the call appreciate it\nThank your mark ... program\nThank you so much I buy oh and here's someone's going to lie I think is going to ask me right away in Las Vegas you're on with mark ...\nYeah I think the one I wouldn't want to have coffee with is Dina Titus now she ran for governor here in Las ... only two hundred vote to show and she was a schoolteacher in the sense of a woman\nAnd I I really do think that a nut Titus could approve of all the dirty tricks in terrible thing the Democrats are doing there's just no way and I predict she's going to switch party affiliations shouldn't as to\nElections stuff is over because I'm sure she's appalled is a lot of those cars that it's just not acceptable and she was raised better than that I Know [noise] so yeah that was going to have coffee it was so deep Dina 'cause there's just no way in the world she could have proof of any of these okay\n... well except for one thing the I appreciate your call you didn't follow the rules of the game you had to pick someone running for president not that I Know her and I didn't know some of the other candidates running I certainly didn't know them well\nBut the the game was you had to pick someone who's running for president and say who you would sit down and have coffee with an eye on the other gentleman agreed me Bernie Sanders I that's I think he's the head right now so we got to hear your votes let us know what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye for right now you have your national\nForecast or video roadblock\nWhether highlights around the nation today persistent rain is expected for the next few days over Texas where

again from who you would have coffee with mark I turn on red Iranian [noise]\n\nWell ... run your very articulate and you are blind challenge do for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your call and you have a great night thanks so much and let's go to ... ah yeah we have time right you can in needs that Hammond, Indiana\nI wanted to speak to the question of\nIn Indiana\nI wanted to speak to the question of all across the treaty will record 'em knowing much rural or if you lose an election you out one or two choices you to leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nOur moral reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't violate\nAll remember all the sort of saw the ... the possibilities Democrats going through ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office or think back to the Bush administration a lot of people both the enhanced interrogation was on multiple\nRight so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern where the incoming administration prosecute the leader of the leaders of the ... the former nutrition leaders of the other party because our our politics have become too hostile\nAs it is we need to take a step back and understand that there are certain traditions that are critical to our are having a stable democracy that we have and rule of law\nIs only one of the\n... well that's an interesting point because it you know a lot of people and the other side I think she shouldn't be above the law\nBut as you point out that she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what the what what what the what wait a second what the FBI and the Justice Department did with a soft coup trying to get rid of the incoming president\nSo this is a very complicated situation and she ...\nThe Justice Department but I'll give you one ... my point after the civil war right the Confederate Sam committed treason could obviously committed treason yeah we do not try to walk them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back together\nGood a good point can I you know I said you may not have heard me I said whoever talks in the last I didn't quite say that but that's what I was thinking on this issue with Hillary a you made a good point that's a great point with the civil war I preach old who could you have coffee with\nOn the other side or when it probably\nI Would probably lead toward a Ben Sasse\nUh-huh he's bright guy yeah he's he's things things are good you did you pass the test\nYou did very well thanks so much here I Am I Can't stay with Tucker across that have you ever watch Fox News got these people answering questions in the news that's kind of dumb but this is interesting because\nI could you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along with people on the opposing party and and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least respected them speaking of respecting animals go to live in Pittsburgh Lynn you're on with mark\n\nWell you know I had a rude awakening this morning\nI uh I woke up and my radio was still on and I heard righteous Joe\nAnd has a dissertation on how I'm basically he can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and and why you should be able to get away with it um\nBut as Hillary is concerned um I kind of signed on to the previous caller just might be for me um if she really had broken the law and then found guilty then certainly should be locked up um\nBut right just Joe\nThat sounded like a polluted twisted demonic rant\nAnd when I hear people like him talking it makes me wish that the Native Americans in this country that had bars on the shores of this country to keep his math the lazy hateful\nAncestors out of this country\nAnd I would like to have coffee I wait on on the other side I'm\nEven though I disagree with most of her politics um as a progressive myself that would be a Lisa Murkowski\nBecause that woman she's a she's a strong woman she's she's an example to tip to women on my side ah\nNow that's a woman with some integrity and character and strength\nAnd she's a bad ass\nWould you have said that if she voted for Kavanaugh's nomination\nNo I'm thinking about some of her actions over a period of time I remember when when uh there was a little spray with Trump and I'm a she says she wasn't going to live in fear of a tweet\nWow that really knocked me back I was really impressed with that so uh she showed that she's a she's a woman up strength\nAnd character and she's not going to be bullied by anybody on on either side so\nBefore I let you go who's your choice who is your choice of the Democratic nomination\nWell I haven't decided yet I Would like for some of the old you know the old timers to just step aside\nA here in my a state that we've we we have someone that a lot of people were liking ah his name as Conor Lamb and I really like for you know like for more people like him to rise and I don't want to see Joe Biden run again\nUm I think that he's had a history of saying some stupid things and and uh\nIt I I Would not like to see him run again a he's a good guy but\nUm you know some of these people just need to step out of the way and a lot of new crop of progressive uh come through\nYeah\nGreat point Lynn I appreciate your call a especially on the other side by the way saying talking about stepping aside so you got Nancy Pelosi in her seventies\nCliburn I think his third in line Sonny ... in his seventies their own there's nothing wrong with that except for ah she was saying a lot of people would like there was an article about I don't know ... times where it was about people stepping aside for the younger generation problem is in the house if you serve in the house\nAnd you don't share a committee or just ... it is not a very\nUh what can I say a interesting life to lead you know I made it that I'd love to be a congressman viewpoint to meet tomorrow that's not what I'm saying but compared to the other positions there\nBut the Democrats have that problem to let me know what you think's or asking to questions who is your choice to run against a President Trump and who could just sit down and have a cup of coffee with you guys a surprise me it just of all that question but you're surprised me 'cause you're picking people on the other side\nThat you admired least could sit down and talk with so let me know what you think about that to mark I are sitting in on red I

I'll tell you what I'll do for you tomorrow or I Will talk as as a part time teacher I'll talk a little bit more about our educational system but this hour for freight line or run smart helping run

means pulling down Confederate flag or statues because that's how my children\nReal good to have them up because they let us know that the north through on the south laws\nAnd the Texas southern state than even want to let that allowed three light it with audit Cindy from the beginning we didn't find out until would\nNot generally pain but yet the June June or the other side that thrown at them June Eighteenth sixty five\nSo my point being is this your dad wannabe Ali's while gee I Want to have yeah I Want to complain about the sanctuary city my whole question is I'm ... from the white man is not being in jail for a for\n... million with the girls you know that ... that is for one and most of them out and he joined them away but they're not being locked up for a certain crime and they feel like that's really nice for them to be able to sit and do things you have\nComments your last you know ... and I'm like wow you about I'm given given I\nWell I appreciate you letting me finish on on the show that I'm doing but okay go ahead I'll let you finish but you may get tired of being\nAnd okay I mean I'm I'm a cut it out and then you know a lot of times when I look at the the summer the incidents where people haven't been shot not people\nI I Can't agree with the police I don't blame them because you should uh you know say you should have just you know adhered to what they were saying instead of you to do but still I mean I don't no matter how you look at it no matter how you put it\nOut immigrants to a land that was never our than the first place [noise]\nNever going to the third and I know I'm going to want to know if they want to go in the history won't you wouldn't\nKnow how to respond okay I'm going to try to respond to okay so I gave it a lot of time\nSo first of all you said something about the land was taken from the Indians that they were here first the only problem with that is there were Indians before those Indians and their Indians before those Indians and there's nobody living anywhere on planet earth today that didn't take it from someone else that someone was there originally\nThat's just what happens in life it's it's you could say it's unfortunate and shouldn't be that way but you need to know your history so even Indians took it from other Indians\nAnd in terms of the slave trade you also probably know this may be don't\nMany of the people who are involved in the slave trade were blacks were brought blacks over here I'm not saying it was good it was obviously terrible to bring people here against their will\nWhat you do you have to put this in perspective\nThe time it was if slavery was absolutely awful and horrible but if it's one country that's trying to atone for that more maybe more than any other country in the world which the United states of America we understood that that came out you know they have ... no no no it's my turn now to monitor\nAnd we understood it would just had a black president of the year I mean the the overwhelming majority of Americans want the best for all their citizens they don't care about race in color and so on and uh the uh I don't I wasn't sure your last point I wanted to respond to it\nAh but then you said that the police when they do do some shooting I couldn't tell if you were trying to say that they ah they were not being responsible and some case sometimes that does happen someone get shot never should have been shot and they're they're they're good and bad policemen they're good bad talk show host\nBut in general that you probably know the two most blacks are ... murders by blacks or by uh from other blacks and in the inter many inner cities they want more police not fewer because they want to be protected I actually I'm going to keep going longer so go ahead now you respond [noise]\n[noise] okay and like I said no matter how you look at it the one thing I can say if I Can't say anything about\nHow so how president I appreciate everything he's done because our he had done what Air America dirty laundry instead of everybody sweep the right for them on the on the ... like it's dirt now that it out and being forecast that\nWould everybody would knew that when you have Republicans that's against this man\nBecause how he how and how he eggs that whatever the case may be ...\nStupidity goes a long way it goes a long way\nBut I think a lot of people\nLike I saw a lot of my people y'all can get mad at this man I Want to but the one good thing that he did bring about in this country was air the fact that the racism and hatred in America alone it's horrible it's horrible\nWay way way way where so where is he wears the racist you mean with the lowest black unemployment rate maybe ever but we were exactly see racist I did I didn't catch that\nI'm not saying like I said he aired the dirty laundry this country has been races for many many years but\nEverybody wants to so I didn't know that now I now I didn't know that is because they don't want to embrace what\nRadio station here because you all very on edge expect black the beep to respond on here\nNo one to expect anybody responded by the way I'm by the way you kept saying my people I saw him we're all Americans that we all live in you know read the same air as John Kennedy said we're all in this together slowly and people on your side and by your side I don't mean color\nI mean values in politics people on your side I have a group mentality I\nDon't see people that way I see people as individuals\nAnd I want you know I like people who share my value way way way way back I Know it's not your turn now I'm finishing so let's not talk over each other\nI Would be happy you may have heard me say this this week I'd be happy with nine a black women Supreme Court justices if they share my point of view because I don't care about color and it looks like you do\n\nYou still there I think she hung up and she'd been maybe I certainly didn't I just wanted to know

filling in on that I Am radio and\nThey're going to your calls and let's go to let's see what the cameras up to in New York City Pam you're on with mark\nYes Hi Mark I'm [noise]\nFlorida and Texas those two states are easy to get a little that the Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say that I Am very concerned about the race when governor and senator and Florida\nAnd the rates that senator in tech that's and I really haven't heard very much about it but um\nI get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that John ah several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida after that terrible hurricane last year\nAnd the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote a ... in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two state and I had to\nLive in Florida and I really can't have with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah and that's another topic I have down for tonight I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you still get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I I think Cruz is going to win and I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fool's gold like he was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct I handed the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race I think the senatorial races is also if he so that will depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country and the Democrat side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more\nAnd the Democrat side but you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate I think we're better off as individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm content to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation in in in you know Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe money when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrats who live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well\nIn those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have ten percent tax\nIf the governor's race just won by the Democrats in Florida and he wants to do a lot of radical things and at that gentleman a couple of callers ago said you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer health care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand that for their own their own them\nBeing down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrats in there and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are ... are on the surface if you don't explored they oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about then I'll turn but the same job necessarily\nA and that would make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of leftist than liberal positions are defeated bowl but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know that I think the overwhelming majority American people did not want to go through pitchmen again I was wrong I was for it with Bill Clinton and what happened he ... he won reelection um\nPeople's ... American people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaves leaving that aside\nThey treated him so badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes went to Congress by the wave announced that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else so that you want to talk about but

reminder that winter weather can arrive quickly and oftentimes without warning and the high country and there is today is look at your national forecast Trump ... radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nAnd I'm ... and if you want to listen to the shows you done this week at a red eye radio show dot com and hit the listen live button and you can hear all of the show even local city doesn't carry on mark I read I read [noise]\nI'm well I'm\nI recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant\nUm she got pregnant um well I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married\nAnd then\nShe ... she left she's gone\nShe ... she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way the act\nAnd I'm just not touching up from what the previous previous speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that he didn't come here\nIllegally have a have a you know get pregnant\nAnd then just totally disregard\nEverything\nAnd then live off the government um you can't get deported you can't um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then they want to\nJust stay here and and uh\nIt it it's an amazing thing I'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience um I met her to live with it you know with a lawyer ... everything\nI guess you don't ... you don't see your child then\nNo\nNo um they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors the women against violence um act um\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to green card and\n... and you know um I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to a\nGeorge in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nAnd mark I keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't do but I think it's also a misnomer\nWe do not have an illegal immigration we have an in Beijing going out these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're we're being invaded by the failures of the other ...\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nThere was any if it was their military doing it we wouldn't be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and it happens because there are people on the other side of have an agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America as soon as the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they and they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue and it's not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to somebody could calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I probably mess let up standing around with market\nOh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped your enemy territory for a while\nHopefully we can get ... out of\nTheir uh God but I'm just calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people's\nIllegals not only voting for bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was sick and I'm happy to stop that [noise] and if you remember like during the ah with when we were sitting up governments either in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is [noise] they were taking a people who are voting and dying their ... you know there are some purple\nYou know they wouldn't vote more than\nOnce and I would say like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals put people voting more than once in a new disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nBut you you you know the whole controversy over for a voter id\nThat the other side had money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's the big crime to ask someone to yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are so you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but you know or being races were being this you know how could you do that yet by the way my position is different than most people don't want people to vote\nUnless they care enough to put some for some effort\nI'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or you get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I was thinking also about a year so the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I was saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote\nAnd you know that you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting or I don't they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id said you're already there it's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and\nSay you a digital camera feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another war or district or state one of the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted\nPreviously on that day\nAnd age but at the same time he could be starting voter id form you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their address\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know uh [noise] you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them [noise]\nAnd ah but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them\nTo see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered and more than one place\nAnd then well there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... I think he was up so often Emily I Know that do but there's another point that bet you didn't think of\nI don't know that your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures or they can't even find my name have the time of Pennsylvania or new no originally you know yeah I'm right right so you go in the\n... who are you oh Martha and that's when you go over to that table\nYou're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out and if I ever won the Newbery vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had to you\nIf I ever won the Newbery vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had any also give them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have stand you ever selected ideas but they're not going to work have a great evening\nOr tell you one one thing I did have that went into vote one time there was a primary and uh they had a and I asked them if I can have you know a a write in ballot\nRight and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never writing about I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like I'm\nTotally amazed they say well you know what's going on and he said well [noise] oh oh you know you're a you want to vote Republican and goes uh or or Democrat I couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do a write in ballots [noise]\nAnd I says well you said I could and he says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nRight you know I I\nI thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democratic side you can't run if you're a Republican and why my laughing voter fraud happens all the time I
