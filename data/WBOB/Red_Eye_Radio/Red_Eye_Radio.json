we're talking about the political divide in this country but we've had some great color so far we really appreciate it thanks to all people of other stories you want to make sure recover them back to your calls\nAnd comments on the political divide in America I just I traveled over this one on um MSNBC and on Saturday joy read and the panel were in a discussion on voter suppression you know they've got the\nVery tight race Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp for governor of Georgia than\nThey are trying to make a big deal he's from voter suppression voter suppression they're talking about the fact that\nUh there's you know there's a law in Georgia that you have to purge the rules and they got it wrong it said after every two elections it's not it after seven years and by the way a lot of people have got that wrong it's after seven years you have to purchase it and they're like\nSeven years and by the way a lot of people left have got that wrong it's after seven years you have to purchase it and they're like and voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression\nThe law was passed by Democrats in Nineteen Ninety seven that you had to purge the rose after seven years if you didn't vote ... if you didn't vote so so Democrats passed the law it's like yeah but he wants to do it [laughter]\nWe passed it we didn't really mean that he means it they\nWere Democrats we passed the law to purge the voter rolls if you don't vote every seven yeah but he's actually doing it and he's a Republican so that's bad he's suppressing the vote I mean this is all by the way if you want the most bizarre issue out there it's the claim of voter suppression by the Democrats\n[noise]\nThat is when you think about it how bizarre that is\n\nYeah um it's huh it's just like the money in politics we hate it if the other side's raising more money than we love it at that too is raising a ton of money so and and then oh Casio Cortez\nShe did it was very little money\nSo they're not ... they're one more example of them just basically reaching out every time they get defeated they'll reach out and well we need to change that well that works against us\n\nBy the way voter fraud doesn't happen the story's a couple of weeks old but I I Want to bring it because we we got involved there were so many different topics going on we were on vacation never got to this a couple of weeks ago for women were indicted in North north Texas voter fraud ring\nFor women who are accused of targeting elderly voters were indicted on thirty felony counts of voter fraud and arrested following an investigation by the Texas attorney general\nBefore women who are accused of targeting elderly voters in twenty sixteen were indicted on\nThirty felony counts of voter fraud the defendants were members\nOf an organized voter fraud rang and were paid to target elderly voters in certain ... uh northern Fort Worth precincts in a scheme to generate a large number of mail ballots than a harvest those ballots for specific candidates the officers news released said\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz and have it once by twenty huge number of people we voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question\nWell you know we have to point out and I don't know if this is a part of it or if this would be in in the you know part of the answer to that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nThat but we we talk about two years ago Ted Cruz being the demon oh uh yeah I agree with you you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know\n... there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house that hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the RMC at the convention in the summer twenty sixteen\nYeah but without stage but now he's beautiful dead yes right well because now is useful\nBut if you decided to challenge the president to manage it in twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course a stranger and I was better find was that it actually deal to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but\nIt it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well but in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement and now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me even though the president is with him and Houston\nI'm not I mean I I think he would probably again which some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott\nAnd are not going to support Ted Cruz for one reason or the other and it's it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixteen\nI Would love to see those votes how many both for Abbott but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote for Senate mhm yeah\nKnow there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great and wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered the ... in fact been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with for her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that and then and those that\nDepartment under her leadership so you look at that and that and and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but\nWe'll see what word comes together I guess on election day in and how many people actually did vote for Abbott ... wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to

and\n\nAnd when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black but to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the I'm Out of the mindset of groupthink that it ... it I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin and then my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that and that's what I Try to some of the ... you're you're you're pointing the finger at a a\nRepublican plantation what I'm saying what what ... are you are on right now that one out loud here it's a fake as you really think because\nWhen when you talk to folks\nAbout the homosexual ... and the marriage thing or whatever that you're talking to the mission by issue is lined up with more of a conservative mindset but because of their best so brave brainwashed and ... of racism racism racism racism you know at clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I I Wonder because you know we talked about the identity politics with a with the ... with the Democrats and the identity politics that are really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're a a man you can be a woman and\nThe the country in law's must\nAh recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black legally and I started thinking about that and wonder\nHow many cars we said that we said with the transgender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jumped to the trans racial I said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there standing wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and\nI thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was just a ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay maybe this is time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nTo the extent that challenges so what does the fight for a ... foot at all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that\nYou can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race so there because there's transgender as there's also a trans racial is them and they want you to believe well if that's how you identify will hold on a second\nBecause if you look at a\nYou know the the the civil rights act the protected groups created under the civil rights act\nIf there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group\nThen there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups then the civil rights era is done it's over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era\nThat happened there all that entire battle it's we're not\nAnd not only that you know the um the civil war was for a new fight\nAgainst other oppressive a governmental systems there are no why did we fight you know just to say it looks like that which should have done that uh we're we're on another different paths now so I'm like no\nWe are Americans this was America we're not saying that we're as individuals better than anybody or any other country for say our ideas are better than everybody else yes or any other country\nYes and ... and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas say in in in the constitution where\nThey they don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the left throws at the conservatives in at the right that you do you want to acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are how horrendous racism and slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative that which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town that we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to a town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can have a system with but he was he was much much more conservative\nBut he left the Democrats that well I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with somebody and he died before I got to ask him\nBut I said ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics\nOr changed him but when you think of what they what the Republican but the Democrats\nUsed to claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about and then the identity politics where everything is about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe the woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be it must leave the white man over the black\nYou know over over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't\nWhite man over the black it all over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you go by evidence and what I find in credit is what I find incredible the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming from the Democrats\nWill do I what I talk to black about\nThat situation I'm fully understand\nThat a\nCause I don't remember it was all white lady that was several years ago she ran away and a ship it or to black males as so every black male that within the city and okay look under scrutiny and they came out that she just wanted to run away right now so\nI'm like no you have to understand that that\nIf you go to that system we fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against cultural for which\nJames uh thank you so much ... than the yeah I mean you're not the first person who was called the show and said look I'm black try being me and the conservative and live my life\nWell you know what's interesting too is that you go through the day to day experiences and we hear that from callers uh every so often\nAnd and I think of and then you mentioned the signs in the yard I have a a a a neighbor I spend my neighbor for almost Fifteen Years at the end of my street he's so he's at the corner he's got a corner lot right\nAnd one of the street corner not not our street but the the the cross street there\nIs a is six lanes so there's a lot of traffic but he has a cruise sign and another conservative that's running on the state level for for a for Congress here um that is our our our congressmen on the state level\nAnd I just I just wonder I haven't asked him yet 'cause I haven't had a chance to talk to him he's a black conservative but I haven't had a chance to ask him has anybody ever tried to steal your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media\nAs anyone ever tried to steal your signs\nYou know from your guard because he has them right there on the on the side where the big street is\nAnd so I don't know I I Would love to to know that if if anyone's ever attempted that he's he's always working in the yard\nI you know I I think the of a\nGroup that the president spoke to the young black leadership summit mhm and the responses that you got in the media coverage of it\nAnd James like our our last caller and this is striking fear I'm not saying there is a monumental change in in a black is going to vote Republican but they're much higher profile now and getting much more coverage the left\nCannot permit that they must demonize

I wouldn't mind taking it out to any gossip just plays a Texas ... anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would not be a bit disturbed\nThere's there's nothing I'm I'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I and I to be clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I I like my life ... I don't want to change it mhm I and\nI don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your\nLife I have a a a friend who uh a friend or family member who ah ... at one time was working for a a multibillion it um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day\nMhm and\nMy family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule is very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener thinks we are [noise] um but but\nThe point was is there so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes uh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to know\nI couldn't have lost anyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people about what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation mhm you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kinda money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard to demand that you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\n... exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money because of a sudden you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my in laws there are laws about\nReceiving the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nWell my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job for getting out what to do even if they're not going to give it away that's what I made it still going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone my life is life fight that right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going you write a play out of it let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like my like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life\nYeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life that I Do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be greatly excited about that mhm oh yeah no I don't know what I Would love you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I was just one dumped optical ...\nMind but it's still a thought oh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion because every day I mean I I Am\nTalking about is is that about one more point six billion because every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't\nYou and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other title oh we've got we've ever done really I mean it's ...

know where you're I mean we really I got it it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse that we have the end of the show we grab our lunch pail to go to that is what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift is the only time I work third shift\nI Try to be in a machinist mhm so the mentality started the same for it so I but the the the thought is and so there are still you know challenges that I think about reading and what to do here and there and\nYou know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life you've one point six billion\nAll that goes away and and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right but I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep debt the thinking adept at a distance well all those challenges the problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going\nTo get all this money death [laughter] I was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a\nGuy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed the game and he sold it ah I I I don't know of all have to look it up but anyway the guy sold his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars\nAnd his take of that was a you know roughly like one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight\nI obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets and he was talking about I was at this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires and I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know worked you know for a living at a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was look I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird are pleased to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's a here's the problem\nWith being famously wealth or like the the the the person in my family member works for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other you're famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has that security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because there are people there are threats against you all the\nTime is one of the that story that I read that you read that you mentioned earlier talked about the guy who won the big lottery right and was actually what the ah kidnapped or some of his family was kidnapped or whatever I played the right when the money yeah\nYou know so you need at that point when you when that kind of money you probably need security so your whole life was destroyed went through security once ... once you have a possibly\nWhat not I'm not a policy per se what are we learning on average people are security I couldn't ... yeah you know I it it would be a very different way of life I I don't know how you make it

in six months ago that this would ever happen where President Trump is coming to Texas\n[laughter] the campaign and rally for for Ted Cruz for for for Ted Cruz yeah right and\nThe vote your conscience Ted Cruz [laughter]\nThat our point of the other twenty filthy we're remembering their member and and this this is why again a lot of times what happens\nIn her party between a a you know a couple of candidates means nothing right right right and when you think about it broke her member to remember what Trump was you know Trump was promoting the conspiracy theory remember that\nThat Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination talk\nAbout the whole vote your conscience well that's [laughter]\nThat's what we said anything anything since then the ... because that was a minor it's like well don't you did you hear what he's done well now did you hear what he said that two years in six months ago at your\nFather was part of the plot that led to the assassinate assassination of a president that's not a small claim you know like your father was once a Democrat\n[laughter] he killed Kennedy\nAnd you know and today there will be a really yeah you're right now and and I had a bigger place they were in a small place move a bigger place now the campaign is claiming Trump twenty twenty campaign boasting a hundred thousand people plus interested in attending\nOkay so Washington Examiner a late Sunday evening posted ... supporters are lining up for blocks one day before the big Trump cruise rally in Houston so they were lining up a as early Sunday\nTo get him [laughter]\nAt this rally I don't know I don't know if that that's been um\nOr they were they were showing some people the basically it was some reporters that we're showing some pictures on social media uh people uh that were camped out I mean these are real pictures it looks like people that are supporters\nAnd there are there basically on the sidewalk waiting to get in for a rally but doesn't start until the next day this was a Sunday evening there in Houston\nRight ... ... this is this is not\nNo no there's not it is not this is not going to buy\nA game or whatever [noise] nah its support someone in spirit that he wanted to vote\nYou know a better guess at that right\nYeah it it gets here it is a a a dense midterm advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the G O P these seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap the Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk of likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day and this we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nLeading up to ... cents I don't know to what extent I Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the rights is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I'll I'll watch it on the might call before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because\nMy was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion\nAbout the Russian collusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and move it to the Republicans before we started talking about I think that's important because I don't find many people like Mike ...\nI don't think honestly\nNow we covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to mankind and we do think that we have looked at it more or as investigators in partisans\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warranted and and and everything there that we are going to find out that probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already\nThe only evidence of colluding with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to giving the money to uh Perkins gave it to a fusion GPS and gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his\nSalacious unbearable fight information\nOr I or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin ... so the only people that colluded in any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have at this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um\nIt it could it is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it but\nIt could be there again is that underlying motivator\nThat's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that they've been alleging all of this sense you know a after the election and since certainly he's become president\nUh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing I think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's like you are now I don't I don't see it I look I I think\nThat there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included a ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian collusion thinking how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month\nIn the energy level or what are they called the excitement level of Republican voters to come out which\nWould make the difference in keeping the house and increasing the number in the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion\nRight or the Mueller investigation at all but not and see I don't know what a a a ... report does\nThe if the if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would ah issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the midterm\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be inaccurate report without including the fact that of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not as that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't you can't let out a report I don't think they do it's it's incomplete um what I Know what the report right now it's not going to even talk about that and and that's that sold points to it but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of Trump colluding with the Russians I just\nBecause where where it would be the evidence if there is not going to be in a movement on ... if it is just to report\nA movement on the indictment if it is just to report a chrysalis over at CNN\nA former Washington Post I write it you know where he said you know I think it's ... it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while it's it's ultimately just going to be a report it's really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing ... probably will never see those ... right\nBecause it and that will be a complete does that it'll just happening right it's it's something I noticed the landing on the\nLast two years you had accusations got just as good as her\nExcept for the fact\nThat you have the I. G. working on some information of what was going on at the department of justice during that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz\nAnd we've been asking this where I still haven't seen anybody else ask what ... what we asked why would the White House says it to the inspector general ... we're talking about the\nBet is that is the most interesting mystery that exist right now in Washington DC and nobody is talking is asking the question what do you start out by the way on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said wise you sending it to the idea the only reason the ideas because\nYou suspect corruption why are there no leaks on this why is nothing coming out on the story at All right\nWhen red and people have just to refresh you win rubber when President Trump said he's going to declassify\n... the ... the application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice for almost Twenty one different pages but uh and then it came out well he\nUh uh we have some allies or don't want us to ah you know released it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general to look at it and expedite\nWhatever that are bad hoard yeah expedite a report out of and we said well why would you give it to the I. G. I. G. is nothing to do with whether you should release it oh\nCorruption and how how to our allies know what would be how our allies know what's in it and what's not in it how could they object either way because they don't\nSo why are you studying the I. G. because one region you started the id is that you believe you because you declassified have spotted a criminal event and you know\nThat as\nThe the role of the I. G. and because of the power that they have the G can go in and get the documents that even oversight committees haven't been able to get within the department of justice and the White House\nWouldn't be able to get it I mean that would be a political move right and it's also takes it out of the political realm you give it to the idea you go to war which and see what horror which can find in horn which has access to every corner milk and cranny and the ...\nAnd and since that happened what almost three weeks ago McGregor maybe you and I said what are we missing here is that what what are we missing alcohol but he also talking about this are we missing something completely in it right at eight six six Ninety red eye\n[noise] eight six six months [noise]\n[noise] right now has he and Petro stuffing centers wonderfully strong and soft wonder Jill purple extreme seat cushions is on sale for only sixty four Ninety seven\nAnd not to mention the ...

about a ... at the times that we live in and I hear that a lot and it's not that I'm trying to um argue with you or disagree with you\nBut I think we're looking at it in a different sense that I think it's not really that I don't think that's the case I think it's more of it's the media so and ... and they're out there they don't care now that I've been trying to hide what tests that they believe in\nAnd they don't care [laughter] and so because of that they they get so many we find that people that just buy into that garbage and that's why they have this perception of this is the times we live and and but it's not really that I think it's just the media is so abusive but I Want to get your take on that\nYeah you wow you you may have points I should have brought up thank you they know the the influence of the media right first of all they don't hide and how they feel I don't know why I think of an entertainer when I used to watch Johnny Carson oh I'm I never knew his political point of view I suspect he was a Democrat or liberal but he never had it out there\nNow again means with comedian\nBut but the media is such a powerful role because so many people that's all they hear right the major news channels not so much right now that we have more the blogs and the Internet and all that stuff talk radio\nBut the place to be role and they have an agenda who's the guy from CNN or like the character that it's always trying to get something on Trump I Can't even think of his name ...\nI don't want to learn [laughter] said a mountain [laughter] Ryan my ...\nAnd you know I mean right and he wants to publicity and they don't you're right and I there is any more they don't hide biased they act like advocates and they're not journalists over the\nProblem I have with it is is that this is supposed to\nBe a country that has room for all people are all political parties and they're making all about them and that's really an immature a point of view in a way to perceive them and then look at things it it means that\nYou can't pull out of their own people and that's not what America's about [noise]\nI I got to answer your but I've got aunts my producer who just told me said the Anderson Cooper no because I thought of a Jim Acosta and you didn't want me to give them publicity but that's the guy\nAnd he loves it it's about and so I'm playing right into you know the name I Know you didn't but I'm showing my producer he doesn't have it\nBecause it's told me to [laughter] wrong but then there's so many of them he's actors right right they they want to take on the

there without helping Donald Trump do but he's doing\nI I don't even know how he's accomplishing what he's accomplished Matthias hands tied behind his back already he's killing it was because he owes nobody anything this ... problem was only I think going to be solved\nBy make people accountable leader and FBI when he gets the eye and when you get justice system but we can\nMake ... third world country I mean well here's a laundry list of things that ... you could go to prison for as long as her husband as well as their daughter\nAnd starting with Iraq Obama and down to the lowest person working in the White House right now under this administration they need to be held accountable and by that I Need you need to go to jail and they need to give up their mind is\nBecause money is what gives them the power\nAnd end with opera money and without the power and nothing you can start taking this seriously my God we ... the main Joe who called a ages ago uh out here we are what are we teaching our children I stand on the top one night next to him everything's just said twice\nBecause my tax dollars are going to these college isn't giving these communist candy or\nThey're teaching our children to hate our country to hate America\nAnd and now we wonder why the countries the way it is\nBecause nobody's been taught physics nobody knows how the government works that dumb down that's like the way they like something\nThat kids need to be sent to being sent to terrorists you know uh to to to do their thing in college and give it to Cuba send them to Cuba or to Venezuela and see how that works out for them that socialist life\nYeah but they they don't know that right no you're good but they use\nAnd now that that's why ... capital and I'd go down there and play football and see how that works out for him\nWhy why ... capital down there and play football and see how that works out for him\nYou know I get oil his educated\nYou know what I mentioned Bruce ... last night one of the things he said on my show years ago was every generation has to learn what makes America exceptional over and over again because certainly if the schools aren't doing it and ... knew that if they can indoctrinate the kids get them early enough they'd have future generations of voters but you're absolutely right\nThey except for people like me they never hear the other side I get both sides they don't even know what party I mean\nBut they never hear well how they can just\nRide to the office of president and it's just and then it's a pure communist and what's your name Hillary Clinton as solid landscape personified as so what's the rock Obama why do we want these people to turn this country into what one is a way is\nRight why\nBecause you're asking me if I'm On their side say that\nWell people don't understand they don't how evil communism\nIs was they don't know I remember I quoted Michael Moore that when they have in our area capital planning on let me just finish fought wait hold on hold on one second I caught him you know it's okay by quota Michael Moore when they said to him he said he doesn't win capitals and they said to him so what would you replace it with and he said we haven't found it yet\nSo even there is some of the people who are proud of donated yeah that's what he said\nA year but you're absolutely right because they've never heard the other side and they think the young people think today that socialism is wonderful they have no clue because\nThey've been taught part ...\nI mean it's I I'm sure you've taught civics in school today are taught how to govern network gets me branches and they had to learn that we had to run a court case these kids today they all do man in the state I don't even ask people have questions and\nThey don't have a clue not a clue voting and the next election\nI mean are they going to be certain criteria\nFor being able to that maybe you need to be a landowner have to have I have a stake in this you
