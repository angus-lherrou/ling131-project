about the ... murders\nOn Saturday and I say that when it comes to religion God I'll leave that morning Dennis but I Do know politics and government and I do know that we keep jumping over our guard rails\nWhich sweat the left and the Democrats and the media do when you find someone guilty without corroborating witnesses where you go back to high school to examine teenage behavior or you don't allow people you disagree with their free speech or when our press leaves their objectivity behind and adopts the agenda one of the parties they agree with\nSo I Want to follow up with what I began with when I filled in on the Larry Elder show on friday\nWe started with comments about the would be bomber's arrest I don't want to use his name to give them any publicity but how the media have used that to pile on President Trump held a along with the Democrats and the left all all the same thing these days to claim that President Trump has created the atmosphere if not worse\nTo claim that President Trump has created the atmosphere if not worse to encourage acts like it would be bomber\nNot like to see what Michael Moore suggested this last weekend as a quote the threat of right wing violence against figures on the American left is not new it is not an aberration it is not a violation of norms it is the norm watch this river Murdoch's Fox News channel and right wing radio there we are\nHave preyed upon those who've seen their American Dream go up in smoke and they have helped to create a generation of angry that's what you guys are angry and violin conspiracy theorists who believe any live is perpetuated on those airwaves these angry right wing man's oh it's really folks [laughter]\nHave been openly or hopefully encouraged to act on those lies I guess he met openly encourage people to act on those lies even as late as this very morning when Trump was tweeting his doubts that the moms were real so\nThat's just one example that the president tweeted the bombs may not be real since no one was killed I gotta admit it but thought crossed my mind too that maybe you know the bomber didn't want to kill anybody who knows the bombs may have been threatened but it's not an outrageous says he wants to make it\nAnd why what's he do that while conspiracies on the right\nDid he name some real ones of course not they never named him and how about left wing conspiracy dawned on me perpetuated by left wing channels what about that nine eleven never happened and that George Bush created it\nOr this this is one you may be familiar with that President Trump colluded with the Russians you've spent two years on that one and as far as I Know it's still cold\nAnd President Trump was guilty of inciting the pipe bomber right that's the reason on or yeah as we said I Believe it or not in the second attack on the Jewish temple\nAnd their unchallenged even on right wing Fox so here he's picking on Fox not that I Want to defend them was former Obama official climbing that's what I looted to the President Trump's rhetorical helped lead to an environment in which the temple murder operate I think it was an assistant sector state I there wasn't anybody famous\nOf course the president created anti Semite or encourage them to create a tax or violence even though his grandchildren are Orthodox Jews and the murder made it clear he was anti Trump\nThe media will never give up on their agenda to blame him for everything bad that occurs and that the president's attacks on the media would not only fostering such a climate but we're unjustified\nSee at Fox News hosts like Shepard Smith well you know what side he's on an even Chris Wallace in some ways joining that course and what to some of them site is proof\nThe chance of lock her up\nThe phrase fake media or even worse for them the enemy of the people so let me address these issues by by the way tell me in the crowd that crop first because it's a legitimate conversation to decide whether or not Hillary Clinton is above the law and should be charged and tried for the crimes she committed\nIn fact when I suggested on another national show whereas I was filling in for the week that I'd be willing to give her a pass I felt this way I'll give her a pass on jail if she ... bill would agree to go away and leave us alone\nWhich obviously they would never do [laughter] I was being facetious I wouldn't be willing so to speak to let sleeping dogs live so one called challenged means that I I Can't believe you mark I agree with everything you're saying as usually you often get that but you're suggesting that Hillary's above the law and she should get away with her crimes\nAnd I have to admit his challenge was more than fair and I couldn't really answer except what I'm kind of thought of afterwards it might be good\nFor the sake of the country not to put everyone through such a trial\nCan you imagine the outcry and the further device on this if that's even possible mature that might bring to the country but that doesn't change the fact that it's a ... legitimate discussion to have about whether she should be tried for crimes especially since you got a free pass\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption at the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for her actions and the cries to lock her up represent the Irish people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people want them to go to jail no he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that as one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so lock her up is not by any means and incitement to violence the other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people\nThere'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and there are beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate\nThe press not infrequently comes out with stores that are not true the latest example did you hear this one NBC was hiding expose Qatari evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's it's a cute one it's a good one [noise]\nIt seems NBC knew that you didn't even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John I think I got something on Shawn he didn't hear that bit of news yeah\nThis so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respective or many of his supporters of\nThe media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so if they're no longer objective reporters and a part of some of the left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy\nTo the detriment of the truth so for example and I'll talk about on the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother never mentioned the fact that none of this would happen if the mothers didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that\nOr the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone is guilty of a crime catch this that shelter also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother or father\nHow come that hardly ever reporter by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener so the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she was on Fox News even though he more picked on them\nAnd saw at all it's all they lack the proper documents to come to this country or your house or take your bank account they just don't have the right documents so of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports and so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people and not allowing them to make their own\nDecisions let me know what you think I think this is a big part of the issue he's right\n... and\nI\nDo you all know about ... food storage let me tell you or it's quakes hurricanes floods every week there's another disaster in the news are you prepared\nOr your family have food during a disaster sixty percent of all households are not

that people make and I was going to make this girl are over there and some of the others and I don't even think it's true the percentage of illegals or he won't admit their legal she calls them undocumented who commit crimes or even less\nThan American native born Americans so watch if they commit one crime in the here illegally one murder like Kate Steinle each time we go on and on\nThen that's one that wouldn't have been committed if they weren't allowed to enter the country that is a crazy argument\nMuscles to kind of thing President Obama would do you set up a straw dummy\nIt doesn't matter from the percentages of same they shouldn't be here ... those people would be alive that girl can't think of her name and Iowa most are named musician resources\nHave better spent on

just came from those Social Security office over there must be\nAnd uh they started telling my story they had made the journey from walk a mile or what the Mexico have you to get to\nTexas and uh she\nSaid you know how their Social Security a work permit ... have you and it already secured there are no benefits as far as food stamps and some housing benefits there or they were living a

I didn't even know what happened to me which was that was just ... curls in any way he has a book out because he he is thoughtful that's the reason that I'm I'm having a mom with regard to this I mean a lot of people in television or write books God Bless them\nBut the Tucker Carlson is worth reading the book is ship a full citizen great a great title\nHow selfish ruling class he's bringing America to the brink of revolution so let's talk about your book the book of folks is up at the dentist Prager dot com so\nWhy does it mean a ruling class who who is in that class\nWhile the people that I grew up with um certain just to be totally clear I'm not much of a populist and I'm certainly not a representative from coal country I mean I grew up in ... in Georgetown so it's basically people who have thrive\nUnder our current economic system if you want to know with ... you know if you look around and you and the people you know are richer than they were\nBefore the financial crisis of two thousand eight you know you're probably in that group and it's not a slur it's just you know every society is higher hierarchical because people are higher mean dogs are higher mammals are\nSo you're always going to have a relatively small number of people who worked for them to the question is not are you going to have a ruling class the question is are they upped the task of ruling in my argument is that the people currently in charge or not and that's why we got Trump\nOkay so so this was a very heavy stuff there let me let me ... seconds for a second ruling class for you is an economic criteria and not a political or ... criteria and\nWell it is both is both it's the it's the look if you look around the country to three hundred and thirty five million there and almost an infinite number of decisions he made about how those people live what they can say what they do for a living\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and one ... gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense maybe a little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to net is share for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nSignificant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members of met a share and it's growing like crazy find out how much you could save and why men is share is so popular go to net a shared a comical\nStar star five five six that star star five five six messaging data rates may apply call star star five five sections apply talk radio am six hundred and one on one point one meal [noise]\nWho was the best healthcare system in the world and why a lot of heat chin policy expert at Stanford has the answer and the newest video from ... university was either ... dot com where we teach and what is its own\nWhat you just heard\nWere on the floor for\n... he was giving ... video that come out in about two weeks on immigration and it's terrific\nTucker Carlson is my guest he has written just now what has come out to ship fools that much about how the elites are hurting the United states and and that goes just across the board\n... let me let me give you a headline from today and I would like you to tell me if if that is related to your thesis okay a ... year it is okay so here it is half of the u._s. births\nAre out of wedlock ... Fort ... up over forty percent up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy does this have anything to do with the elites\nWhat's at the core of it I mean by the way that's a disaster not simply on a moral level though I think it is but on a practical one their range of social science that may be indisputable point children particularly boys raised in a single parent homes by their mothers are much more likely to fail and\nSingle parent homes by their mothers are much more likely to fail in school and to fail in life to develop addictions to wind up in prison they make less than we're likely to be divorced or have out of wedlock children themselves I mean there's there's no upside to this at all and so if you're running the country and you have an actual interest is a long term success\nThey're very concerned about this and you're going to do whatever you can to make it better our leads the Republican Party is so focused on marginal tax rates they don't feel that sort of the province of ... they can't get involved you know you don't want to sound like Jerry Falwell so don't say anything about it\nAnd on the Democratic side single mothers are the core of their base single mothers are much more dependent on government of course they tend to be overwhelmingly Democrat and so the last thing you want to do in the last thing they do do is is suggests that single motherhood is is\nLess preferable hum than uh raising children two parent biological household so I'm both sides are kind of a lie that unintentionally in downplaying or ignoring this problem meanwhile it got the country how did you say one other thing\nThere is no single Parenthood in my neighborhood\nI live in an affluent neighborhood maybe you do to maybe some of your listeners do and you know that it's like Nineteen fifty five and our neighborhood nobody gets divorced there no single moms on my street\nOf course not because the ruling class understands that marriage\nIs the key to prosperity and happiness and said they don't practice this themselves their children don't practice it to really like divorce rates among rich people are very low it's the middle of the country it's the former middle class\nThat is in in social disarray and this is a huge problem not attacking anybody I'm saying that you really cared about the middle class you would be doing what ever you could to make it easier for people to stay married and raise children intact\nSo okay there was a vice president Dan Quayle you may recall and he spoke out about Murphy Brown the TV character who had a child out of wedlock and he was buried by the national media by academia et cetera so I think\nThat Republicans incorrectly but I think Republicans got burned and they realize hey we talk about social issues we're doomed\n[noise] but but then you wake up one morning you're exactly right that is what happened I was in the sea from that moment until now so I can confirm what you just said that that equation they group but then you wake up one morning and you realize you know tax rates are actually I'm for lower tax but keep our taxes but\nThey're relatively easy to change you just need a majority vote in Congress and the president willing to sign it what's very hard to change the culture and the structure of the family and if that's destroyed you know it takes\nYou know generations to fix it if it can be fixed up their civilization will collapse so Republicans\nKind of missed the actual story which is social issues are the issues\nYou're on a me and your civil society grow out of the kind of life you weren't living that's what they should have been focused on end because they're dumb and cowardly and they listen to the advice of a couple of overpaid and unwise consultants they didn't do that and I think the smart ones regret it now\nYou're smart ones are what are they regret it now oh really no I don't want one leads you to lead you to think that\nBecause I mean you look around Washington and you know most conservatives in DC work at nonprofit think tanks\nAnd not a lot of really great people and nice people who work at the same tax but they've consumed billions of dollars in contributions over the past forty years and America has not become more conservative and the smart ones are asking oh where do we go wrong\nAnd it's not that they're not smart or they didn't try hard but they didn't have the best intentions they get it the best intentions but they were focused on the wrong thing\nOnce he should care about is the way people live the family is the very center it's the Adams in ... the court building block of everything and when that collapses there's no hope\nDoing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel for me asking you this but it's it's truly meant out of curiosity 'cause I saw respect you where do you stand on President Trump\nI think that um well I mean just as an overview I agree with you know the ... the majority the strong with the overwhelming majority of what Trump says\nUm I think ... I think you need to understand from ... Trump's genius is not in affecting policy change I don't think he\nHas control over the executive branch his portion of government I don't think he understands how it works I don't think he's going to learn I don't think he's good at getting his program through Congress settled in Congress wants to get his program into law so on that level Trump is a frustrating president to watch\nI think that Trump's value ingenious is in raising the questions that no one else was willing to raise even think about as a kind of clarity\nVery simple clear he so he will say things like well wait a second you know we had NATO which was this great force for forty years but it existed in order to keep the Soviets were invading Western Europe Soviet style longer exist so why do we still have NATO\nWell I don't know what the answer is that's totally fair question and one that we all should have been asking\nSince Nineteen Ninety One when the Soviet Union collapsed or why we still Afghanistan's seven teen years later or why are we allowing the south Koreans cheat in this trade deal or why don't we build the wall like what's the answer speak slowly so I can understand\nThat his genius being brave enough and clear enough to raise the core questions that we ought to be debating long after Trump's gone those questions will hang in the air and my hope is that someone will answer them and solve those problems but first you need to\nYou need to define what the problems are and I think the Trump has been really good at that\nAll right a final question because I Know I Know your time is limited so you have on guests who I signed a intellectually morally intolerable which is which\nIs fine [laughter] okay\nSo I just want to know where you see their name as listed on your program notes the sumo how long do you think oh my God I Can't believe this or I dread this or you know what this is what I Do for a living and what the hell why\nPut their names on that list so I'm I'm responsible for that and I just filed like literally a minute before I got on the show our story outline for tonight's show and so I'm involved on there no surprises me because I'm involved from the beginning to the end\nBy the purpose in doing that is ... grows out of my belief that you need to hear the whole argument and yes you do that gravy and yeah I Try All right Dr\nBless you great to be with you and folks whose ... jumping demonstrated on\nWill be blessed not all the individuals of the euro all the families that's the basic you\nKnow the chair of I Want to bring to your attention is the ex chair one of my favorite products because I sit on it every day\nAt work when I Am in the studio in LA that is the chair I said oh we have like twenty chairs I could choose that's the one I sit on the X three is the new one it's mind blowing\nPhenomenal chair if you have an office this is the greatest office chair I Know of\nYour employees will thank you which is nice and end up itself could simply try it out go to ... chair dentist dot com there is a thirty day guaranteed so easy to send back you do show no questions asked\nX chair Dennis use the code Dennis a hundred dollars off and a three foot rest ...

wife and I been married about nine years on and when we got married we both recently joined the army so we were active duty soldiers and I'm Ari uh we were heading off to Colorado we were stationed in Colorado so\nI don't get up getting married um and then we just had a nice little dinner found the cheapest a hotel we could in Chicago\nState than I together um and then a ... a couple of days later a packed up the car and drove to Colorado to start a new life now being that we were both I'm active duty military wait for the first thirty six months that aren't so first three years of marriage we were together\nFirst thirty six months of our suffers three years of marriage we were together physically together approximately Eighteen months at that\nTime you know what I ah my point is for your listeners that\nWe principally are are pretty frugal people and when I look back on uh on on our uh when you brought up this topic and I applied my own um experiences of a honeymoon um\nYeah but you know funny move you know you you didn't have a whole a honeymoon right that's the point that\nIt's basically yes because we couldn't afford it\nRight you didn't was ill okay yeah so and so on yeah go on\nA I was the point being is that um that that was a foundational principles and our relationship as we didn't we don't live outside of our means that we felt that if\nWe had to listen to own a you know\nAnybody who stayed the night of his marriage at the cheapest hotel in Chicago is frugal I got that\n... it was chaos for all of our eye five fair about it was a camp up for us\nAll right but in all seriousness your your your actually eat your story which I thought it would actually make gate my ... my provisional theory\nI actually sustains it is that there really is no relationship between the honeymoon and and marriage it it it's it might be good at might not be good I mean you another example of no honeymoon great marriage\nRight well we we also had planned that even though we discuss hey well you know when we can afford it and the time is right well we'll take a hunting within a couple of years ago we actually\nRile kid on a cruise together without the kids and what not but you know what I could afford it\nWell that's part of that my dear Tony thank you it's a it's a thank you for your service to both of you that is another subject which I have in fact cover it and I need to do it again and woman remind my producer about that\nI Am a big fishy an auto a family but I Am in even more adamant to fish out of all of a marriage and therefore I think you need to take vacations without your children\nOn occasion with the children it's great fine if you could take that many vacations more power to you\nBut if you can't\nYou need to you need you need to get to you need to have time together\nAnd is a family vacation a is generally not a romantic get away for parents and that my friends is what is known as an understatement okay thank you Tony so far we're pretty consistent\nAnd let's see what a\nIt's a ... for example up to Beijing Bloomington, Minnesota and bar the famous Barbara Bloomington Hi\nHi thanks for taking my call my story we're both in the
