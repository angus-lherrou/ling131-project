Trump ... a former conservatives I don't know if they were ever conservatives\nOn CNN Today use this as an opportunity to try to smear the President Bill Kristol spoke let's listen\nIf the if the president wanted to come to our synagogue Newsweek and make some talk I Would say no thank you for now it doesn't mean I don't think he's our president I just think he does bear some responsibility for this climate but you know we don't need him we don't need him to help us overcome this right here\nWe don't need him but they're still in office there is no opportunity well I have a different view I think they're an opportunity for him to to speak out a and to answer take accountability for\nYou know crystal ... these people than there are ... are just desperate\nOr to justify their positions says Trump has done everything that conservatives wanted him to what it actually not only him but Republican presidents to do for just that they have never done so the only thing they can do is uh assassinate his character which is what they\nCall it simply do\nThis is ridiculous the you know ... one one comment\nA and I I've I forget it was in response to a question which elicited this where one could be done he said that would be have been helpful if there was a security guard in the synagogue security guards and lots of sitting\nPerfectly wise\nRecommendation\nGot attacked by the Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh forward magazine which is an extreme left wing\nJewish magazine blame him I said the Trump blamed the synagogue you didn't blame the synagogue he made a a perfectly reasonable point a they're a nut case is out there who will kill\nA and it's a synagogue and other other schools\nShould be defended but the Democrats\nAnd the left or so people ranged over gun control issues that it practical steps like this are hard to take\nWell I think that's the case and former rabbi a of the synagogue a live tree of life synagogue\nWas also interviewed and again I'm not blaming anyone in the aftermath of this because people are so upset that the media really dragging this into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire world view\nTo this evil anti he was an anti Trump\nA fanatic that the shooter whose name I Will not use to dignify this airwaves but the airwaves but this is what I'm John Berman on CNN drag the former mayor a former rabbi excuse me on the Senate got that suffered so greatly let's listen\nTo welcome the president of Pittsburgh in the wake of this I Do not welcome the president's him I said hey why not because he's the purveyor of states\nOr the hypocritical um words that come from ... I'm not saying\nWe have a we have very very strong leadership and the city is believing values not just ... I Believe in values and those are not the values that size of that and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh uh the current\nAnd the you know ... forgive me for saying this but I say it is in June the Jews are out to lunch with these issues that first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked\nDonald Trump ... ah you know is of counter punch it basically and he doesn't speak for any group nothing like I mean I turned on MSNBC the other day\nA on it and the Cold War our set a panel everything that there were four people on the panel was the Trump it said I I'm a nationalist\nAnd every single one of them linked to adults Hitler why because every one of them said nationalist is dictator\nWell actually no ah Joseph mess see any of it was it Nineteen century figure who created the modern state in the middle of he's the one who claim nationalism is a Democrat they just won't find a pretext\nTo link Trump to Hitler\nA lawn so down on CNBC\nHe said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's white\nAnd that translates into Hitler that have against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump is kind of actually funny and as a tax\n'em an ally ... light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing a but these people they have done themselves into a whole here\nAnd they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time\nSince Abraham Lincoln that the Democratic party or any major party has gone to war against the legitimate elected president a resistance\nWhich is what Schumer and Pelosi call their campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy\nFor political party ... we have a system of compromise we have a system where there is a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election\nAnd that translates normally into a honeymoon the Gallup\nEstimate is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds that we're boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment the hate is coming from people like this rabbi who insist\nOn demonizing the president of United States which is something that hurts all Americans he as our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush to quote Bush Hitler the Democratic party is out of control and off the rails\nAnd the you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that until a ... there are silver sober Democrats but they're intimidated by the party left now but they will come out of the closet\nJeffrey I have one and Alan Dershowitz yeah exactly Jeffrey Maier yeah Jeffrey Maier says the current rabbi or who of\nCourse is just devastated by what happened to his congregation to his people his worshipers and he was asked the same question on CNN Today in responded like\nThis rabbi I'm President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue in the aftermath this do you have to come\nAround the president of the United states is always welcome\nSome citizen he's my president he's certainly welcome that's a good answer\nSo I'm a citizen he's my president is certainly welcome\nThat's a good answer Neal you know every time I go to a synagogue by ... hopefully that there's a security guard there\nBecause the universities are teaching Jewish hatred\nThey they ... the curriculum\nAnd the middle eastern studies programs but generally is that you know the Jews stole land the land which is to just side ally\nThe land which Israel was created belong to the Turks for four hundred years previously the Turks are not Arabs and they see the dilemma too because they were on the losing side of the first World War\nIt just ... you know there's been a Seventy year aggression against is to destroy the state of Israel and yet if you go on a college campus today the sympathies are with the terrorists\nKnow it's pro pro Palestinian uh the Jews are\nUh the aggressors an on line today and seeing the same thing that did this was caused a and buy a both the president's rhetoric and those Jews in the United states who are are helping support him and then continue to give him cover which I'm writing and stuff going\nThis is this is literally insane I I I have no words to this\nExactly this is the best president from the point of view of Jewish survival uh we've ever had\nA Trump you know in some ways his kids are the docks Jews for crying out here it's just in Saturday and are these so called liberal Jews\nAre contributing a problem we have for the Jews\nBy that well I mean they're always attacking me I've done a lot of demonstrations on college campuses against students for justice in Palestine and I'm not much to the Jewish left\nFor that reason that it's the same thing\nYou know the history here you have to do something but just having a security guard and the synagogue is\nSuch a common sense of course you need that um you know what I have ... or the mayor of Pittsburgh said no that's terrible and and the Jewish magazine blame for say the Trump is blaming the synagogue\nThis legislation double you'll be you'll reality we're two thousand Eighteen ...

government\nOr if you're out there saying the guy should be peace I think they know I'll be able to get stuff done and then people are really concerned about Andrews record in Tallahassee with respect to crime they've had the highest crime rate in Florida and Tallahassee what he's been mayor and last year they had a record number of murders more murders at any time in history\nAnd I'd been endorsed by an unprecedented array of law enforcement groups because at the end of the day they want someone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum and uh he's aligned with groups like the dream\nSomeone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attacked law enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities and they don't want a governor who supports open borders and sanctuary cities in abolishing ice like Andrew does\nNow in a piece today and the hill Obama to campaign for Gillum and Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection Senate ah in Florida how concerned are you about\nThe allure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent [noise]\nSo I'm not I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me than he does for for Andrew because I think folks will uh who may not otherwise want a vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak\nWhen it comes to the misery ... regime and Venezuela so I welcome President Obama al I should be paying for his travel expenses to come down and don't forget you know we have the president of the United states coming down on October thirty first\nUh to Fort Myers in Florida and then likely come again before the election happens and so you know you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz and\nUm you know that put the race away for Ted and I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWe'll get one is silver tongue order I mean that's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about about my political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric tries to ... he tried to do the cool thing that Obama does\nI I don't think he doesn't do it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last may with you for our listeners let's listen\nTo my grandmother used to say you know of all holler\nSanta spoken first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he has spoken a racist conferences not calling this a dissent is a racist I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nAnd of course they are our\nLovely is over and MSNBC et cetera that oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today um there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boycott honors of Israel these anti Israeli organization supporting Gillum ... you know he ... sign this\nPledge called dream defenders hum I pledge my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers are of course I'm also an advocate textbook socialist principles\nThe virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera uh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum honey respond [noise] so yeah like\nI mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew was the one who was align themselves with the dream defenders they are openly antagonistic Israel they support boycott by the sanction of the state of Israel they actually organize boy or a flash mob protest in Israel they have special trips or just the target Israel on and so what\nWe're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of God but strip and so he's way out of step on that um and I would never accept an endorsement\nFrom a group a that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement is racist they say the police and prisons have no place injustice and that law enforcement should be defined that so that's what he said\nI'm In terms of the pledge he signed on but I think that that's just way outside of what is acceptable in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner\nAnd of course at the FBI agent is part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption\nAnd turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks for one and killings fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nWell that's right so he said this last Sunday when we did CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff\nWell then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message is showing he acknowledge that this price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton was\nActually paid for by an undercover FBI agent you start with a with a local real estate developer and and it comes out just a couple of days ago that that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under wrote an almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain nation governor campaign and indeed Andrew\nDid not disclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida will also he\nGoes around saying that he's not been investigator and being investigated but I Would ask the question\nWhat other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and has problems with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting of pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating don't that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nWith the laser ... down to some really simple in these last closing day it's such a sleazy dishes sleazy politics as usual bright people people dangling little benefits and politicians jump\nAnd they just jump okay what do you need what do you need a lot of ... ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter if it's a Hamilton ticket or a trip or restaurant it's sleazy\nCorrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly\nHas has become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in Florida then definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states and you better get out there and vote for Iran to Santa I endorsed Ron over a year ago\nBecause I saw his leadership and his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled\nIt's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama wannabe Gillum for good leadership but it's not\nIt is it's pathetic and by the way a Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan\nI heard the Scarborough absurdity if you're if you're concerned about the care of and you're basically anti Semitic I mean you gotta you gotta diagram\nThat sends a but the but it looks like Floridians in the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll shows that only I'm\nOnly twenty six percent said that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life in the state better thirty eight percent said no impact thirty six percent said it's made life worse than forty three percent said the migrants would ultimate\nThirty six percent said it's made life worse than forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states\nUh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help the migrants and the caravan\nForty nine percent said we should try to help this kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on the uh care about\nWell this is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally brought across our border the fact of the matter is Mexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstance to the nearest refuge they they rejected refuge in Mexico\nBecause they think they have a right to override our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum a support the caravan coming into the United states is running mate was out there saying yesterday\nThat we need to welcome in the Caribbean and the United states um and so you could you have a more stark difference um for borders Andrew stroke and borders I Want to support our men and women and our if he wants to abolish ice\nWell again this is a this is an issue that I think the American people are following very closely I'm Andrew Gillum actually speaking now in Miami and I'm sure we'll a pulse them down there a Kamala Harris stumping with him right now so they they see this race a congressman\nAs absolutely critical for not just the state of Florida now but for twenty twenty and so all their big guns are coming down there so the president's coming for you you had pants down there or what else do you have in store for the final week\nSo it's going to be non stop I mean we're going to be doing we did

talking about earlier welcome to all of your joining us for the third our the phone number is eight seven seven seven six four to four to six eight for eight seven seven\nSeven six for twenty four twenty six\nI brought that up because so many of you are going to open enrollment in their company or this person that emailed me said their insurance benefits their health insurance benefits at their companies going up Thirteen percent not because the insurance went up Thirteen percent the insurance went up a certain amount and\nThe company is decreasing the amount of money they're going to participate in so\nThey would like to\nMove on and save that three or four hundred dollars and I told them they could do that\nBy going to Samaritan ministries have you guys haven't checked out health sharing\nMy wife and I were Samaritan ministries over three years now a or employees have Samaritan ministries it is a great great if you're a small business owner something to think about if you're an individual or something that it's so it's great you're going to get your you know light you're dealing with like minded people\nThat are going to pray for you if you have something that you're sharing a the system is amazing\nAh Samaritan ministries is sharing over twenty six million dollars a month\nTwenty six million dollars a another year this year they're not raising any of the costs or any of the share prices at all\nAnd uh sometimes some months that twice this year once maybe just wants to ... year last year was three\nUm where they reduced the share for the month\nBecause they didn't they didn't have that many needs so it is an amazing ministry and I hope during this open enrollment period it doesn't matter you can lead to you know that it's not just open or moment you can cancel if it's\nYou know it's march and you want out of your company insurance you can even get out\nYou just say I I don't want that anymore and moved to Samaritan ministries doesn't matter\nYou can get out anytime but\nJust saying make sure that you submit to Samaritan get everything approve don't drop it yet until you get it approved you'll know how much it's going to cost you when you apply as soon as you talk to him on the phone you all know that uh but then after that you uh\nWhat's also approved and all of that then you can drop your current insurance and you're gonna save a lot of money\nFor for seven or seven fifty five thirty three aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three let's look at the markets are the ... one point two percent uh the stacks up one point two percent\nThe recipes at one point five percent only ... percent so everything's still managing to hang in there and positive territory or getting a little bit of a rebound after some steep sell offs and let's hope we can hold that's the question is it going to hold the rest of the day we have a long way to go well see we get better could get worse who knows where oil prices\nAre finding a little bit of relief as apparently um\n[noise] the demand worries that we're impacting the cost of oil demand worries coming as a result of sanctions on supplies of oil coming out of Iran who are going to be an issue or have been somewhat\nRelieved\nAs a China stock markets really\nFed those concerns over potential slowed down an energy demand\nSo so China's demand maybe slowing down a some Brent Crude oil coming off a market through Iran and apparently\nUh it's it's expected the titans global supplies a little bit but all in all supplies have increased dramatically so that don't demand issue is not such an issue and we are seeing crude oil prices now\nSitting at sixty six can't see it sixty six point eighty eight sixty six point ADA so crude or down this is very very good news why because we would like to see crude oil prices\nEnough on top of a a big one of those big dumpsters\nUh we're doing you know not we as me but what is going on inside a space you'll see some pictures but if you go to financial issues slash studio\nFinancial issues dot org slash studio if you want to give to our project you'll see some pictures on that page to get an idea of our space there so we did a lot of damage a lot of demolition and we're we're getting ready to rebuild and we've already started some of the construction so\nWe were over there my wife and I do some things\nUm things that you know this is how bad I shouldn't I shouldn't even tell you because you think um stupid I Am but so far contractors charging too much to\nTrim out the officers for all that so I'm doing so we went over there I use a rough stolen cedar and that's what we're using and it's and so we went to see all that to my wife and I went over we see all that and then we decided we have some other kind of painting things were going to do and the clean up is a mess so we had this big huge jumper dumpster well\nIt was it's getting full so I got inside it to kind of move things around and get get it down a little bit more which I did\nI was trying to get out but I was standing on top of the dumpster I squat down ready to get out I lost my balance\nSo I stood back up to get my balance but an unfortunate it didn't work and I went down anyway so um that's what he's talking about so I appreciate that\nSo but I'll take it lifted if it's going to encourage anybody to become a partner to get to the ministry man I'm all about just plain common sense it wasn't just plain commonsense to do that my wife's was why in the world know what you said to me why in the world you up there and I should have\nDone it that's what she said so anyway she's probably right ... thank you for that wanders asking good morning Dan I'm ray a re and I\nMet you and Florence, Alabama last year I was a great town on me to remember our

it all in the Ross and then take it out withdraw some of it or whatever but I Would I Would do it that way if you're going to do it I Would rather see you\nHow old are you guys day in court for both forty nine yeah I Would rather see you\nRoll it over to a traditional i._r._a.\nAnd wherever you set that up to eighty a merit trade you set up a traditional i._r._a. set up a Roth IRA at the same time\nAnd I would when you roll it over to the traditional I Would move whatever you know may be you know a little bit of money maybe thirty thousand dollars or whatever you feel you can row over the bed and you're willing to pay the tax and between now and the time you're sixty five\n... of a plan that you're going to get it all rolled over into their off and just take your time doing it so that the tax burden is not going to hit you all one year\nOh Hey Don king and another question then is that she's gonna start working with a a and I haven't heard about ... to ... ... ...\nWorking with a a and I I haven't heard about that too but not familiar with it sounds like a or B and\nIt is just yes it is just like that um I don't know if the VA matches some they\nDo they do ... percent okay I got a traditionally would have been like twenty percent of our salary to parliament\nOkay so I Would I Would like that you would so in the CSP you've got to do at least the six percent here's what I think would be a really good strategy for you guys 'cause you're young\nI Would rather you get that CSP put six percent in the G is in George ... fund which you\nKnow and she is on um that's not going to earn you much it's consistent with the government bond fund it's biblical responsible [noise] then I Would max out your contributions fifty five hundred dollars into the raw fire right now\nAnd then that other discretionary income that you have that you would like to put into a four one K. or something assuming you're Maxine yours out as well yes then I Would put it in an investment accounts\nBecause you don't want you you're gonna ... as young as you guys are you are going to get to a place when you're ready to retire you're going to have all your money in qualified money of some sort\nAll your money is going to be money that is dictated uncontrolled by rules and regulations from the government and the IRS\nAnd you need to be able to you need to start establishments some ... qualified money it's okay to have a few accounts that have a significant amount of money and that's fine too I Would suggest to but if you're going to have more than that that's fine but\nI I Would want you to put that discretionary income in an advancement account once you max those out it makes a lot of sense now you have an account that is going to have a significant amount of money in it over the years\nBy the time you retire that you're going to have total flexibility with you can do whatever you want with that money you can buy a\nNew house you can buy a rental property you can uh do whatever you want you're going to have the flexibility and you're not going to be under that umbrella of government and reach rules and regulations so\nI I I wouldn't want to max out anything any more than you're already doing it ought to be in an investment again and you do that investment to Canada to name the the marriage rate as well so you understand you you're you're going to know the platform\nAnd how it all work and that would be the best thing I think you could do damage\nThat well thank you very much for your ... and let's make sure that I understand that so jeep and rock art or a board at the at the end of it\n... on my own ... correct yes and not just to join account that you're managing on your own at CD andme Eritrean yes\nWell thank you very much then You're

industry by becoming a partner with us in the ministry once you get for that partnership is access to our investment strategies access your asset allocation models my dock safe to come out every Monday or email alerts that may tell you when you're by yourself or maybe give you come from the bottom\nLine is an incredible value for eighty five dollars a year\nAnd you get to submit it sure would

ministry assured for\nUs to answer your your financial issues Samaritan ministries is a health care sharing ministry that takes us back to the book of acts as a ministry that we have\nThat if this is a mystery that has opened up their doors to me to make sure that it is a ministry that my wife and I wanted to dissipated yes that to me\nFor health care I Hope you will check them out thanked them for supporting foreign ministers Samaritan ministries dot\nOrg [noise] by this is an studio for financial reasons I Hope you will consider partnering with financial issues one of the things that you're going to get from that is access to our by list the access to ourselves ... you're going to become educated about the economy\nAnd the testimony from people just like you I Hope you consider the only the financial issues dot org\nEntering with his ministers that's financial issues dot board\nIt was working with which is\nNot necessarily were listening more shows\nAbout financial issues for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three [noise] your your your carpet you'd probably get a one or two more calls in a let me go to Eric Eric calling us from North Carolina Hey Eric\nHi thanks for taking my call sure I'm so I'm uh thirty four and um I have about\nTen grand around that me and my wife were mulling over there they're kind of starting to invest it and I like that they're doing the the biblical investing and I was looking at the same with a plan that I hear you talking about but uh that's um that's all the mutual funds I was kind of\nWondering if we were debating between doing that and maybe joining your ministry and and uh using your plans to kinda you know more like individual stock you know and so I wasn't sure if you had any recommendation on on just where to start\nI just yeah yeah so do you have anything set aside at work or anything for retirement\nOh yes yes I actually ... my uh four one K. contribution every year okay so so this is money that the smell just heading to the side and got you um I Know I make too much to qualify for the raw account right um but I really just wasn't sure whether it be the best place to start\nSo I think what you ought to do is get an open up and accounts um at any trade or TDY Amir trade or fidelity brokerage or you know one of the one of the a discount brokers 'em\nAnd follow along with it with a investment account a joy is just a joined account is an investment accounts [noise] uh that you that you can begin\nYup a joy is just to join account it's an investment account\nOr that you that you can begin to

A. N. F. A. J. it rose eight one hundred several point to four point for two percent and a five year adjustable rate mortgage it's still a great deal if you only plan on being in your home five years or less it rose for one hundred separate percent\nTo four point one four percent\nYou know it's interesting you said it's still a great deal they're all great deals they are you're right because I remember and I've told people this before but ... ... ... last year\nRemember and I've told people this before but ... ... ... last year they were the lowest almost in history yes so there are only a point higher there still fantastic rates I Want to\nSay when I got in business Twenty years ago Nineteen Ninety eight I think the rates were about eight percent\nAnd people were buying a house or excited than that it was under the double digits so there you go yeah but then you know we watched it go down and down and down and then it was held down for so long and of course that's what started the frenzy\nSo it's they're still great they are great you know I look at it that way five percent is is wonderful that they are going up so if you're a buyer and you're sitting on the fence and you can't decide whether now it's a good time or not now is a good time because the rates are going up\nSo you're going to be able to afford the last house every time the rate goes up yeah that's the truth now want to hear an interesting\nStory and told us when to my son in law last night told them we were talking about this on the radio he couldn't believe it I I entitled is one a buyers and selling realtors nightmare so Angela and I haven't told you this one yet so imagine how difficult it is to sell a ten million dollar\nProperty it's hard right\n[laughter] it's very hard there's very few buyer few buyers now how about a fifty million dollar house fellow even less fires Howard now we're talking about\nBy the way a property in Manhattan so I kinda figured that enough because they needed million there aren't many fifty million dollar property here in fact there probably zero there's none here there's no so um and there's an offer\nThis is a true story a quarter an hour into Manhattan hello there's an offer on this fifty million dollar property now I presented one problem wait a minute you know presented\nTo the seller now the cellar on most homes is usually a husband and wife and sometimes the husband and wife agree on the terms and the price sometimes that they disagree now this time\nIt's a little bit harder why because the seller is not a person yeah the seller is actually a country\nWhy now think about this how quickly can you get someone in a country\nTo agree on the price [noise] now how what country are you talking about it and wait a minute is I don't understand who do you get approval from do you have to go to the president of that country do you go to the dictator do you go to the parliament I mean who do you do to\nGet depends what country it is what country is it Yugoslavia you could fly is not a country\nThat's right back in the Nineteen nineties Yugoslavia got broken up into five that's right trees Bosnia Croatia\nMacedonia Serbia and Slovenia yes so now instead of one country agreeing on the price this property in New York\nIs owned by five countries and by the way these five countries they don't get along\nYeah that was said you know they don't get along so imagine they they agreed that the property should be sold in fact they agreed years ago that it should be sold\nIt's currently occupied it rented to a a ... to one of the countries who is renting it for something I don't remember but anyway they got an offer\nThey can't agree 'cause they don't agree on anything the buyer this was last year the buyer walked away\nAnd bought another property three blocks away for forty five million dollars\nAnd mass them now are go now it got put back on the market this week\nOkay ah\nI Want to now how did they agree on who the real terror would be I don't know at least ... agree on that that is really funny but it's you know why I think that person is probably stumping that sale it's\nThe one who is renting their property they probably don't want to move I don't know what you\nWant to move out of fifty million dollar property I wouldn't if I was able to rent\nIt I don't know I Would not blame a it's obviously a gorgeous gorgeous place and it is I saw pictures of it you know this being sold furnished the least agreed years ago to sell it\nAnd I guess each of the companies could use an influx of\nYou know a tenth of the fifty million dollars asking price ten and twenty I'm Sorry yes the twentieth a fifth of it\nYeah but they couldn't agree on the terms so the other by or walk and again in these countries who do you go to to agree on the selling price in one of ... going to say well you know I'm mad at this other country [noise]\nWell that's why I'm saying they want ... at the one that really upsetting the apple cart and who ... who do you get to sign the papers now they've already picked that they already know it's going to sign [noise]\n... what if the administration changes in that particular country\n... turning out there that's got the right to sign\nHigh on the kind of nice to have really really interesting started\nNot pulling the strings on decision making but they have the right thing [noise]\nI don't know it's going to be a real headache for the realtor but if they pull it off it's a good pay day for the realtor\nI Would love to be that realtor within fifty million dollar property that something will never happen in our lifetime\nI don't know well it won't happen here that's when I and you know are mean\nAnyway when we come back after the break we're going to talk about for sale by owners will stay with us every one we're also going to answer your questions we'll be right back [noise]\nThe first layer of information which as photos right so when you're marketing at home the photos have to look fantastic they can't be off your cell phone\nYou can't be a free cell by owner and take pictures with your cell phone because you think you're good at it are all your little kid pitchers turnout great so you think you're an awesome photographer that won't do justice to your home when you're in competition with\nHomes in the marketplace that had been taken you know with photographs have been taken by a professional photographer right so you know in our um\nOur a secret sauce I guess you could call it we understand photos are the most important and it's not just you know it's like any other business\nPhotographers are not all created equal there's some that are better than others so it's really worth paying for the good ones I'm also when we do marketing you know we start on the MLS so to for sale by owners\nBut we paid to push that\nOut Watson pace in our case you know to go out to more than two hundred and twenty five Web sites\nFor sale by owner they're not even going to know how to do that right that it's not going to be at their fingertips they're not going to have that knowledge um\nAdditionally they might hold an open house because you know how else would you get people to come\nBut the question is do they know the safety and how to protect themselves and protect their valuables right there's so many different things so marketing is you know we pay for to do at digital campaign right so it goes on Facebook\nAnd it's it goes Fifteen miles around where the property is and when somebody\nClicks on that house than we pay to have it re targeted so it follows that person around for two weeks on your computer here is the first sale by on are going to know how to do that I think not yeah I really think not\nLet's go back to the pictures for a second 'cause of the guys who is really interesting you may think talking so much about pictures because the border of pictures is so important it is so I'm going to give a secret\nTo everyone just so they\nKnow we keep giving our secret sauce that way that could hurt or business people don't know and there are there are so many little tricks like\nThis gay but there are some websites that only show for pictures so if you don't put the right for pictures\nAs the first four yes then you're missing it you may think oh I'm going to show the for outside great pictures well if you're not showing your kitchen in your bathroom and your bedroom which may be the best features of your house they're not getting out there 'cause what sells houses Howard bathrooms\nKitchens

Zillow as a new showing\nYes so they're not going to tell everyone that's right because there are even some realtors that don't know how to do [laughter] can't throw it maybe with the bathwater but we know how to do that so there's so many things other than pictures and we do postcards and we do so now than\nWe send out postcards saying that the houses just listed so that uh you know what that within a two mile radius 'cause there'll be people who are looking for a move up neighborhood\nAnd you know they they will know that your houses on the market to maybe they're not on the Internet or whatever but they'll they'll see it from these postcards that we send we also make marketing flyers to put out in the front yard so people can pick up we also pay for digital campaign\nThat the texting number [noise]\nOr we don't have time to do this whole segment\n[laughter] we pay for it by a a anyway I did\nThe music looming I got to pick up on the next time\nDistracted there's liability issues with the paperwork there are so many scams are bound and we can\nTalk about it when we come back don't rush to this says it's important what the next segment is the fourth we can do that open houses and then talk about it All right well we got lots more things to talk about [laughter]\nAnd most importantly is still sell for more money [noise]\nSay money less money going to talk about\nWhen

do and it's nuts out there\nYeah it's going to be crowded downtown they were doing on the news to get there by ten thirty people want to find a parking spot\nA little tolerance of the out of towners

when they come in we take 'em instead of backing them up\nAnd that makes you not have to spend a whole bunch of time to get your question answered don't be don't ever be afraid to ask what you think there's a simple question I promise you if you don't know the answer there are many many people out there who also don't know\nWe can only all learn together in fact we can learn from you if you ask the right questions or give us some insight that we wouldn't normally think of\nSo remember it's an interactive show and you will be heard should do pick up the phone and call\nSo this week's topics um one unpleasant one that's the market and then some that are considerably better than that what's going to happen we know that we had another bad week on the market but we also know that there's no reason for\nWhat happened is explainable only by that old saying that sometimes all news is good news sometimes all news is bad news and other times all news is just news this week seemed to be mostly on the bad news\nIt was just news this week seemed to be mostly on the bad news and statistically I'll tell you over the time\nThe the month following a bad October is generally not real good not real bad generally just a little negative after which time everything tells us that it will take off and we'll go through a period of time is really extraordinary\nCan't say that will happen but I'm telling you what's happened over time and our trivia question which will give you after the first break reflects some of that if not all of it but anyway I going to let Adam take the ugly part this week that was good news though we had a Thursday\nUp there I gave all the good news you can talk about the rest yeah\nYeah it wasn't real pretty it was um markets all fell more than three percent the month of October has been downright ugly for us equities\nOr goals yep that's true and and that has been the challenge recently much like in the housing market where the month supply was so low there just wasn't any inventory to buy and people were pointing to that as a bad number but that's not a bad number that means demand is through the roof and there isn't enough\nSupply to go around so I that's why the prices have been going up and we've had devastating\nStorms a couple of times just recently to that has come by some economic activity it'll spite that we have come across a lot of that came after this number but the three and a half percent GDP number was very solid\nAnd as areas like the panhandle and the Carolinas are making their comeback\nYou're going to see a flurry of activity over there which is all going to add on to the GDP so I think we're going to close out the year with a very very solid performance and GDP yeah and that helps him on that\nYet and we're willing to earning season as well and it seems like we have a little bit of a problem here with top line growth the earnings beat rate stands at sixty seven point too which is strong in line with the previous quarters\nBut the revenue rate had dropped fifty six percent well below about the Seventy percent rate we have seen for the last three quarters and whether that's expectations have gotten out of control or companies are slipping a little bit and their their top line growth rate both are possibilities it's probably a combination somewhere in between\nThe it's a little bit lower as it stands so far so that's something to keep an eye on and that's the problem that we had had throughout the recovery uh so earnings were growing like crazy and revenues were just not growing for the longest time so hopefully we're not going back to that 'cause that would be that would not be a great sign\nYou know we need more consumers yet which are made from people with jobs and as you know they're seven million jobs openings job openings in this country not enough people to fill them the more people that we can get working a lot of people have been out of the labor market so long they really don't\nHave much clue about how to get back in when truly it's pretty easy nowadays\nYeah uh I mean as far as if there's been a time in my lifetime that it's been easier to find a job I'm not talking about your dream job but a job I don't remember when it was because their jobs are plentiful right now\nI saw Rachel Campos Duffy this morning and she was talking about having just been back to Wisconsin which of course brings kind of hold me with us having been born and raised up there\nAnd she was talking about all the manufacturing this going on and it's like the old days when you'd walk up and down the streets of the where the factories are and so on and everyone has a help wanted sign on and and the all you have to do is walk in and they're going to figure out something that you can do if you're serious about getting the job is is that good up there\nThat's good to hear and the other good news out of earnings season is that more companies are raising guidance than lowering the number slightly lower than has been in the past few quarters but it's still positive so that means that companies are still optimistic about the coming quarters which is that is great news\nYeah I Want it you know how I rail about they they that's in quotation marks who are those guys the economists you know the same ones are predicted date out of the last three recessions\nThe numbers they're putting out now are very difficult to match and expectations so what'd you come up with as a lot of misses the economic data for this week was twenty two two Fifteen of which were negative seven positive and if you look at the numbers column the actual readings on all of this stuff they're beautiful\nBut if you look at the expectation numbers they're higher than those and\nYou don't look at what point do you say something's really good or just good or bad\nMissing expectations if those expectations are unrealistic is not something I pay a great deal of attention to is the economy good yes it is it has been good for some time it will be good for some time to come\nMarkets react to a lot of things in the short run that's the noise somewhere in the noisy period right now but markets long run are driven by economic conditions and ours are excellent\nYeah that was one thing I wanted to talk about too is that um you're carrying a lot of the the talking heads they have we reached peak earnings no meaning that they can only go down from here and I agree it's absolute\nI Would reach peak earnings no meaning that they can only go down from here and I agree it's absolutely remember peak oil that was in the seventies ridiculous I Know that and the answer is they don't we have no idea what's going to happen with earnings going forward but if market conditions they like they are they should continue to improve so\nI I just don't see where they where they're coming up with this this is not as good as it gets and this is that we're never going to get any better anyone who says that hasn't lived long enough\nWhich leads me into some headlines there's ... F get tongue tied and flabbergasted sometimes when I read news in the headlines often those are different things not always so I've got a couple of ... this week\nOn Tuesday Chinese you on their currency to replace US dollar\nBy end of twenty eight team\nNow that means they have two months and four days to replace the u._s. dollar\n... down at the Breton woods conference took place how many decades ago where we declared the u._s. dollar the reserve currency ... I didn't hear of another Britain was being called for November did you know and\nWho sponsored this rather unusual headline Hartford villain the blank group what do you suppose that word might be well four letters long oh starts with G\nGoals oh are we what happened and inking annuities but okay what happens\nIf the dollar gets replaced by another currency\nDemand for dollars falls what happens when demand for anything false price goes down how was gold purchased it is purchased in dollars that means if the dollar goes down the price of gold is going to react is going to take more and more dollars to buy it they're selling gold oh who would've thought\nRight and who is another goody these\nFive charts prove that the stock market is on the cusp of crashing by Seventy percent may be more that was Thursday so on the cusp know how big it costs you suppose it is I don't know\nSeventy percent or more really\nLets see remember oh six seven eight everybody\nSeven eight nine actually yeah should I say it on the S P lost about fifty five percent total so this is going to be bigger than that when that was only matched once in history by the crash of twenty nine\nI'm really and\nBy the way those charts prove it says right there prove so\nI'm I read it all and I didn't see any proof of anything ignore that stuff this one has a website called money and markets which is an aggregator website they bring in stores from all over so I Can't say that they're responsible for it they didn't bring it down and posted and then friday\nMedia on alert recession worse than the great depression coming in twenty twenty of that is irresponsible journalism people what set up the crash of twenty nine the things that set up the crash of seven eight nine they do not exist today\nAnd you could invent a scenario but it is completely irresponsible to publish anything like this\nAlso friday we think the major economies are on the cusp of this turning into the worst recession we've seen in ten years now think about this what's wrong with that story and by the way I'm going to tell you your mother got it instantly ... she nailed this one okay\nWe haven't had one in ten years [laughter]\nSo we're going to enter the worst recession in ten years it would also be the only one well then by definition that is correct that loved that\nThe next recession could put the two thousand a financial crash the shame\nCould being the operative word two thirds of business economists than the U. S. expect a recession to begin by the end of twenty twenty a forecast of weather is not good after three days a forecast of economic thinking is not good after about twenty minutes\nOf this stuff you'll hear it [noise] but\nYou won't hear here except as we sit here and make fun of hey no attention to the man behind the curtain things are fine look at the real numbers look at all the people you know that are working to look at how your markets done with their minds but the question is still open what's the what's the value of a few years\nAfter the break we go into some more things that an indifferent\nJust got a whole bunch of great stuff to talk about today\n[noise] one of them is [noise]\nIncome planning [noise] what's that mean to you especially as you get a little older\nThan required minimum distribution reform which is part of that is trying to reform the way we are I'm days they have a great opportunity to get it right here very much so that they will say said opportunity to get it wrong we'll talk about that [laughter] it was the right after the break this is a man was a natural [noise]\nI forgot the best part this lady that I did have tried to obtain a seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar line of credit\nBy making false statements to the bank changed her best friend account against or yeah which was according to her with for a million dollars in reality once the documents came a available in court her net portfolio value was thirty five dollars [laughter]\nNo I haven't [laughter] yeah you know at a laugh but you really shouldn't be crying because those were real people's money that she absolutely and they believed to her well for them you see 'em on TV and you read a bottom the\nPictures on the financial advisor magazine everything's great right yeah very about our own people but you\nThat's not good enough people in I don't think anybody out and do business with us just 'cause we're on the radio but you ought to come see us just because of that goes by the time to get there you're going to understand the things we dislike him to all the things we tell you to do we do so if if you want to sit down and give us a call at the office and\nAdam will give you a run down on that before the show's over on the various and sundry ways to get a hold of us\nBut now I I Want to make very clear that I Am not picking on the website money and markets today as I said they're an aggregator I Do not know where this one comes from but this one is so egregious I Can't help but talk about it\nReport more than half of Americans collect more on welfare than they pay in taxes\nThat what is the possible outcome of that first I just think about it for a moment half collect more welfare than they pay in taxes does that seem right to you folks\nThat I don't that doesn't make a lot of ... no it does not make a lot of sense and here's why a recent report by the ... Institute for those of you don't know ... this was a very famous economist and one of the good ones\nSays more than half of Americans get more money in welfare through things like Medicare Medicaid food stamps and Social Security [laughter] then they pay in taxes each year wait a second is Social Security welfare\nNo and neither is Medicare\nNo what do you have to do to collect\nMedicare and Social Security that you have to you have to be old\nAnd you have to have work then you have to have paid into the system not just a little bit either you have to have ten\nOr forty quarters which ten years of earnings covered in the system in order to even walk into the office and begin to discuss getting that it is an entitlement it is not welfare and now everybody's going to sit back and say that's not an entitlement let me do you find that for you\nThe warden title ... means just this something to which you are in titled\nIt can be entitled by virtue of the fact that you paid your premiums therefore you are entitled to the benefits and that's all it means\nTechnically Social Security and Medicare are entitlements we don't normally say that because the politicians have ruined the word as they have ruined so many other words that they no longer mean what they are\nThey're not exactly trans a transfer payments government transfer payments either end that they're not\nIn theory they're not collective from one person and paid to another but in actuality they are because Social Security is a pay as you go system So Adam pays in every month and I take it out every month it transferred from him to me but I take it out against my account\nThat's not the same thing as him giving me money or the government giving me money is a columnist building even though they're using the money his account is accumulating filled let's get this real clear\nMedicare and Social Security are not welfare people this is absolutely nuts\nThey now they break it down into brackets than the

doggone it the stock market did its best isn't it I have an absolutely huge show for you today you're going to want to hear every single minute of it\nIt all starts right now I I think it's best\nTo start to show out maybe by sharing with you a few comments that I sent out to our clients this Wednesday remember Wednesday that was a really bad day\nSent it out Wednesday evening after that really horrible what six hundred dish point drop in the evening by our amazing Gemini private client portal involved\nSent it out there is no to our clients Wednesday evening after the great stock market up that's what it was a few cup which few all over the all over the wall street New York stock exchange for a few people can upgrade stocks\nBefore I tell you though exactly what I told our clients let me ask you a question\nLet me ask you a question be honest with me but I already know the answer soon assumed that when I ask a question I already know the answer what does your advisor tell you to do with your money this week how did they advise you about the stock market puke up\nYou should never conduct business in a restaurant because number one I'll take every advantage I can of view and so I'm listening to these Democrats in the booth behind me to Jay's talking to their whack job advisor who I got her business card I don't even though she's actually license to do business\nBut when you when you when you drag this much politics into your investment career and your investment business this may be a little over the edge but this was\nOne whacked out group of people I digress maybe I've gone too far may continue with a script for all run out of time I'm certain\nI told you I wrote to our clients that we had ... about us steel so many times in the past hundred years and every\nTime we bailed out US Steel all US Steel did was raise their prices I told you in February I was I Would support subsidizing US Steel have US Steel would agree not to raise prices on their steel to American manufacturers\nAnd those were the only condition as I was subsidize that company is actively that would have met with amounted to have now having nationalized US Steel\nBut what is the\nPoint of protecting US Steel a new car and chaos and all the red steel dynamics what is the point of that if all they're going to do is crammed price increases down the throats of Harley Davidson of caterpillar see all the great stars anybody to use the steel and America\nIs a point of that Mr President because maybe I'm not as smart as you maybe my hands are not as big\n\nI'm pretty certain I'm smarter than Peter Navarro I got rocks in my garden that are smarter than Peter Navarro union\nDoug I\nTold you about this\nBut the union union lobbyist Navarro\nWhen he leaves this White House and maybe it's only what Thirteen more days six more days seven nine more days how many how much longer do you stay with the administration wants to pandering once the red meat pandering to the base has affected it's it's it is intended purpose which is to\nGet you to vote for Republicans how much longer Donald Trump actually going to keep the moron around how much longer is he going to want to stay\nBecause what should happen as we should be making a deal with China like I don't know six and a half seconds after the president wins this election and there should be no used to have an an an idiot\nLike Peter Navarro anywhere around the president's Secret Service should hold him out telling Peter your your ear stupidity it's contagious it's monumental that's catastrophic\nYes\nMiddle that's catastrophic especially this pain in America you're trying to national security\nThreat to the economy you're conspiring with a shotgun to crush the American stock market\nBut maybe I'm wrong what is your advisor tell you\nRemember what I've been telling you week after week after week after week now and I tell you the story for a reason it's usually everything I say is either I don't know to make a point or to make a show more entertaining but in this case it's because it's a really smart thing and I really really want you to hear it the cure for high\nOil prices the saying always used to be was high oil prices right you get\nOil down at a sixty dollars a barrel and it goes to a hundred and twenty dollars a barrel like they did in two thousand and seven and a hundred and forty like it did in two thousand see I've been around long enough to remember these things and you guys have not\nWhen oil gets up to a hundred and forty dollars a barrel you know what happens to those guys driving those sixty five Seventy five Seventy thousand dollar ... and ... they start selling them\nBecause it's going to cost about a hundred and forty dollars to fill the damn thing up and I don't know who you are but you know even though you can finance that trucker lease that truck for next to nothing when it really comes time to start dumping in a hundred and twenty five hundred and forty dollars worth of gas and you see how fast the mom is try to get rid of those toys\nAnd that's what's gonna happen again [noise] so what happens is that oil prices go up the\nMommy's are going to say well I Can't afford to fill up the escalator sweetheart you're going to have to walk a little but the school it's only three blocks away anyway you're going to have to walk to school\nAnd the demand for oil comes down and and the price of oil calms down so as you destroy the demand you lower the price of oil and we're seeing that we're seeing oil price so so I'm listening to this last job make\nBelieve financial advisor to join us more about that kind of sad sounds buying up all the oil in the world girls a whack I don't know who would listen to this ... donkey was story okay what oh oil prices are doing is getting ready to\nGo back down to its not opinion is just the fact is just the fact jak because what's happened is that it's not\nPrices have gotten to a point that your do your destroying demand\nAnd that's what's gonna happen for China to cure for the trade war is the trade war do you hear upset I Am with this trade war do you have any idea\nHow many billions and billions and hundreds of billions of dollars of damage or done to the stock market this week\nAs a result of this to pets trade war which is not really a trade war at\nAll\nIt's not a trade war is a plot by Peter no more oh to drag that base out to get you guys all and said hey John and we're going to kill China go jaguars don't don't patriots no my team do you don't do your team only our teams good\nOh they're trying to do it drag your butts out to the vote next week good go vote\n\nI have more on China's coming up if you think you're going to push China around to make sure that you understand something America before you send me or hate mail and you send your emails\nYou know nothing about China\nYou know nothing because America doesn't read number one and what you do read the local newspapers that's all the same stuff from the Associated Press and the rest of the of the rest of the wire services\nAmerica I got people to go to China and come back and tell me what's going on in China I see things that you'd I read papers foreign papers or you don't even know exist\nUntil you something America you know nothing about China you know nothing about who the economic superpower in this world really is at best that's a draw at\nBest it's a draw the longer and more painful this trade more gets the more likely we are to make a deal because the cure for the China trade or is the prolonging other China's trade war\nBoth sides both sides are feeling the pain one side doesn't have to worry about it because he's a left it for a life and he's a communist they don't care what people think they print money like we do they manipulate currencies\nThey don't care about the other guy the other guy is limited and restrained by the fact that I don't know presently he's only here for two more years and if he loses elections next week I pretty much going to be a lame duck after that [noise] so once I have unlimited power\nAnd the other side is trying to find a trade war while his own Federal Reserve chairman is trying to crushing\n\nOne sides fighting with all the weaponry they got the other guys fighting with two hands tied behind his back and Peter Navarro for consumers really are a\n\nI don't know maybe I'm wrong\nSo this is the cure for these high steel prices what we're learning that were caused by this twenty five percent tariff that the idiot Peter Navarro who is a union lobbyist for the steel industry was then we'll be again and we'll have more money and more kickbacks from the unions and steel industries when he gets out in a few weeks\nWhat's happened is a ... ... the cure for these high steel prices\nThe caterpillar is telling you we can't sell bulldozer so no science we don't need any more steel and Harley Davidson say no thanks we can't sell motorcycles so no thanks we don't need no more steel\nAnd whirl pools had to raise their prices on washing machines and dishwashers which is mainly steel and plastic twice and now consumer demand they're telling using the toilet\nAnd those tanks we don't need any more steel\nAnd electro ... the big European appliance manufacturers said the same thing this Friday morning no thanks we don't need no more stinking steal you have managed to destroy our business you\nManage to crush demand for caterpillar bulldozer for fast so now I'm nuts bolts screws for Harley Davidson's for world washing machine from may to watch you managed to destroy it you've managed to destroy the man for our products\nAnd their sits US Steel and robe and the\nSenate but didn't make a deal with Mexico to make sure they have some border control stick keep illegals the hell out of our country so I don't know how to build an eleven billion dollar wall and never going to ever get built\nSo what I'm saying to you as I Would have rallied a team around me\nBecause that's what president G and China did a year and a half a rally attain even here on his team or he has you shocked\nBut our president wants to go on to battle with China if that's what you believe he's doing with two hands tied behind his back am am theater Navarro for a ... right\nNow to Peter Navarro is not a wartime considerably or I don't think so I don't think Peter ... Peter is not up to the job that Peter was any good he wouldn't be a ... he wouldn't be a lobbyist for US Steel Peter Navarro was any good\nYou'd have a real job selling shoes like al Bundy\nThat's the way I Would have conducted a trade war automate damn sure it was a war to the deaths\nIt's either on war to the death and just like via damn nam interests awarded a death or it's not a war war fighting\n\nIf you've got to have a fight with your wife you might as well divorce or move on to\nGet a new one\nBecause anything other than a combination of a divorce it's just a waste that afternoon it's just not worth it you just can end up buying a jury and selling or you're sorry and just buying a dinner and it's going to start over ... nothing's been\nResolved\nAnd let me make sure that you understand there is no trade war with China\nThis is about bragging your butts out the vote next week I got more on China in part to but I promise you\nI reached out to Peter I reached out to Michael Pillsbury the author of the book the hundred year marathon this week I apparently he's not going to have time to give me the interview that I asked for this week and time to get it on the radio but I promise you\nThe ss China you're not pushing it around the ... ss China that country we call the ss China this\nLittle forty horse power Honda you got on the back here and going to push the ss China around nobody wants a trade war with China nobody's that stupid Donald Trump didn't get to be as rich as he is by having a by getting into a war with his biggest customer\nNow you guys may have listened to Sean Hannity and bought into this stupid but my mom and dad and raise know fools\n\nThis is a ruse loses a joke these are talking points you want to talk about fake news\nI promise you I promise you\nIn a year or two years or six months or a week when this is over one of you come to me and tell me what this trade war did for you know no I get it if you're apple yeah you got some man you've you've got some protection from patents\nYour if your caterpillar maybe you don't have maybe you got some trade secrets preserve your Harley Davidson maybe some day but you and me\nYou driving around and not white cart you and that black are you at home on the arts no you wouldn't get nothing out of this mess up all their profit you had stored up in the stock market and\nParaded this week thank you Peter Navarro so he said how can God Marty you are one negative so you know what no I'm not I'm just\nPractical because right here in my right here in my I had pro\nMy beautiful brand new Apple iPhone ... pro I have good news I have a headline that you haven't heard you're not going to hear from that more on Sean Hannity you're not going to hear from the idiot Laura Ingraham by the way I heard that make and Kelly's for sale okay I heard that that\nCrazy ... job that crazy man ... job is for sale if they don't fire ... Laura Ingraham and go bring Megan Kelly back I don't know what those thoughts boys are thinking\nBut if they were my son's I'd I'd I'd I'd X amount of the will if they don't ... plus replies Laura anger and bring and tell Megan Kelly they're sorry and replace Laura Ingraham Megan Kelly I don't know what those people are thinking or Tucker Carlson I'd say Sean Hannity\nBut I Know you guys loving I honest to God you got you guys all got a man crush on Sean Hannity me\nTo me if you hurt Sean Hannity once you've heard him on a thousand times anyway there's great news flashing right across my professional semi professional news wire system\nWhich we now call the Internet there's a new you want to hear is great news out of China steers what I'm saying America listen to what I'm saying it is one hundred percent undeniable that your president has screwed up has sprung up this mess with China\nTank\nUnder the supervision of Peter Navarro overall I I I Love all your older client's I really did I Love some of your clients that are older but when you get to be Wilbur Ross his age you need to vacate the premises you need to turn the\nWilbur Ross is age you need to vacate the premises you need to turn the job over to our younger mind 'cause 'cause Wilbur Ross was once a really bright guy but this man is a this guy's adult I mean and this guy this I don't know what's happened to Wilbur\nRoss I had great expectations for the secretary I mean I really did I truly had great expectations\nWeather is great news there is great news for the president\n\nIs news flashing out of China right now the no one is reporting and China is is is this is putting out yet another olive branch and it will be as every other olive branch the Peter Navarro has received it will be picked up Paulson they're faced\nStuck in their eyes because Peter of ours a moron\nBut here's the olive branch here's the way out here's the way to turn the stock market around a thousand points next week here's a way to get your money back and it's from China you want to hear it\nHears that news out of China nobody's reporting it go after the other guy go ask your advisor infidelity banned by ray machines that were just Morgan Stanley Merrill Lynch go ask any of those annuity salesman\nAsk them all if they heard this news and reported it to you and the answer is no they didn't hear the news out of China the U.S that this is old and has the U.S is refusing to resume trade negotiations with China and\nTo Beijing comes up with a concrete proposal to address Washington's complaints reading\nAbout forced technology transfer and other economic issues forced technology transfer that's what this trade war is about it's got nothing to do with mom and pop who got their butts kicked in the stock market this week\nIf Kentucky Fried chicken wants to give away the fifty seven spices in recipes to make the fried chicken to the child comes in order to sell ... chance to sell chicken to the Chinese Tom's fine that's Kentucky Fried chicken sausage and I don't care\nIf Google wants to go over there and make a special Web browser for the Chinese\nThat's Google's dead man and I'm not going to make any money on that deal\nAnd so so now you hear real clearly what this trade war is about\nThe steel deal was nothing more than Peter Navarro lining his pockets with future lobbying feel these fees from the steel industry that was just graft and outright corruption he should be indicted by the same as me I just looking for Hillary's tapes and bombs\nThat was good\nBut what the trade war that the president is in favor of is about is this idea of forced technology transfer\nAnd another way is that going to make your life's any better than no way are you going to be one penny richer than you are today well yeah you will if the lawsuit just stop turning into law so you'll be rich or just by virtue of the laws and the thing\nThe article continues the impasse\nThe impasse threatens to undermine a meeting between President Trump and president Xi Jinping of China that is scheduled for November thirtieth at the G twenty leaders summit\nAnd boy does that is both sides that hope the gathering would ease trade tensions that's the plan even that crazy even that crazy girl it to just tell her client hey you know stock markets go if we can get the election and then we get the gene Tony deal for stocks go back up\nDon't jump out the window yet might not be over that lady might not have a song both sides had hoped that the gathering with these trade tensions us businesses have been counting on sufficient progress hell I'm counting on it to infinity and beyond I have an entire\nInvestment faces based on the idea that we make peace with the child comes at the G twenty on November thirtieth\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "27", "locations": [["Jacksonville", 30.33218, -81.65565], ["Washington Trump", 46.774, -121.78093],

independents\nSay that immigration has changed their area for the worse fifty one percent of voters are said they want their congressional candidates to talk about immigration\nA lot that's fascinating\nLess than ten percent of voters support current levels of immigration and to the United states as opposed to eighty one percent of voters who supports curbing immigration levels\nThat's a Harvard Harris Poll that was done at the beginning of this year a stunning thirty five percent said the levels should be fewer than two hundred and fifty thousand a year that's a quarter of what we allow in legally now\n\nNineteen percent said it should be two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand combined that makes it a ... a majority at least fifty percent or they want to cut of oh at least fifty percent to current annual levels of immigration\nJust Nineteen percent of respondents said they want an increase over the current one million people they allow into the country legally

things seem to be changing around here\nI mean now you have to let you have to know Spanish to get certain jobs in certain industries\nBy the way one of the guys they interviewed on the ah\nBut the thing I tweeted out last night and the LA Times article that that's in the LA Times today one of the guys interview said well I ... I expect to be getting a job in construction very soon well of course why ... unscrupulous builders hire people come into the United states who claim they have a skill\nAnd who are then brought into a pool of other illegal immigrants who also do these jobs\nBut you think you're getting like this great these great artists and were coming in and doing like the craftsman building I'll please\nGive me a break um we're not calling in a caravan any longer a book but Bob Bob ball let's go to Mike line to Mike real quick ten seconds\nOr you know um when you're just talking about African American conservative but when you talk about the African Americans are for or against illegal immigrants these jobs are African Americans used to do\nOur cricket oval by legal immigrants and we're ...\nWell good ... spread the word Mike spread the word in your community we have a lot more to get you coming up Marsha Blackburn going to join us\n\n\nThe ... but a real life story from trinity debt management\nAnd I had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity if\nYou're in depth and you need to help coal trinity of one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a certified towns were\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether\nCould he will consolidate your accounts to the one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop to late fees and over limit charges and reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors of being able to pay off to Fifteen thousand dollars in Alaska Eighteen months\nMake certain our border is secure I encourage Mexico to make certain that they're border is secure into the air protecting their sovereignty will cause this is not something that you know people entering by force\nIs not something that we should view as being an acceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nTo the poems whose first do this you know big numbers are very Persian way of looking at the world Babe Ruth burger that are hard to tell people that were was I'm not\nSure if you want to move things forward makes compromise is trying to do for immigration here all these big issues with one of them would be really sure people were more\nSo we had eight years of Obama motivated they mess of our healthcare system and we did catch and release so what does he talking about\nLike well you know just this this is going to be language that you hear from a liberal when it they don't want to stand on constitutional principles\nAnd we hear it over and over I have one of the most she bipartisan record of accomplishment of anyone in the house and I continue to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\n... freedom hope an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's sovereignty\nAnd protecting our borders securing the southern border\nOr is it in my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when he was governor he gave valid state issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to sixty one filed for them\nThey're legal aliens team they tend to see a haven for illegal aliens in our general assembly stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but it's a difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater\nI fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them does certificates and I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policies I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think Phil Bredesen would be somebody there at the border welcoming dental giving them\nA state issued id and of course we know the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders so I'd say let's stand firm on this end to what to make certain that these caravans now they cannot just come walking and our country and receiving benefits\nTennessee and want to see us to deal with the gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human drive tractors and secure the border\nWell again we're getting reports from rural Virginia I'm this is you know rural Virginia down south West Virginia or illegal immigrants there uh again demanding services go off and getting paid in cash\nAnd this undermines us a worker or of all backgrounds legal immigration legal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond set up with us and how it has to stop\nA congresswoman Blackburn what what would you ah in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and didn't do anything which I'm personally livid about this there's no reason this mobile mobs should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall [noise]\nWell you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get to the Senate to take that up and that is a good place to start and to remind people that said is and executive Menlo program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it daily and go with those issues funding the wall I Am a show for putting that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing the southern border you know large realized walls work anybody doubts that don't talk to Israel wrong work\nAnd what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country that are not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I met with say an angel on the other day and the Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by illegal aliens\nWho had had several\nRun ins with law enforcement\nAnd of course her daughter is she did she is rearing his grandson and that illegal alien went back to Mexico and this is not ...\nIt's it's not right and for these families they want to see justice they want to make certain that we do eat verify that employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in West and she I talked to a guy who has a\nA brick and mortar bait a business and\nAnd he was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him his son to get work now because they're being under the bed by those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior\nKnow totally out of hand\nAnd then he and his sons go in\nAnd do it right but he said you know these big jobs for he and his sons to keep their Mason growing business in in gear to keep it growing again and so\nThese are real issues and why I Will tell you this I think when people look at the immigration issue they do see it as a security issue not having the borders secured every child is a border town every state supporter state and it's one of the fraternal order of police\nHas endorsed to me and my son ... crime tough on trafficking truck on tough on the drug issue the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue they see it as an issue that affects them and their community and to law enforcement personnel that are working to keep their community shame\nOn again uh we're talking to Marsha Blackburn here on a ... show we've hit\nOpen Monday through Saturday central a goal five Ninety seven

had like um to get that answered and we'll get that to you by the way I was just going to tell you about some update but Netflix\nSo you think of well there's not a lot of bonds out there or prefer is I don't know how they're issuing this and what type what form yet but they're issuing two billion dollars\nWorth of a bond or it is says you're a bond offering their offering a bond offering ... billion dollars worth of bond offerings uh let's see if they're having a coupon rates here they don't uh so we'll see what that looks like a not a bond or whatever by a Netflix is the last\nUm thing I Would buy but I'll just tell you this\nIt's three ticks a way it's being issued three takes away from being junk\nBut in this field is so so competitive\nThat nobody has a lock on it nobody has a lock on the success or seeing mergers and acquisitions Disney and Fox Studios 'em or you know are just one we don't know what's gonna happen with Time Warner now you've got um\nOh I Can't think of the big movie company begins with a pie that's terrible\nHow ... ...\n... ... is\nParamount is is a now got a on demand kind of channel and that is growing and they've got an enormous amount of content so on and on a goes there's lots of competition every body is trying to get a piece of this cut your cable market\nSo uh you know it's I'm just throwing it out there so when your broker calls you and says hey we got some great bonds here I just want to tell you from a from a ... perspective from a highly rated\nBond they're not very so just say\nI mean it it would fall and the risk risky category there so just be careful that I wanted to throw that out to you by the way\nAll the indices they really haven't moved the author lows they're also offer highs they opened up very positive right now the Dallas down a quarter less than a quarter of one percent\nThen as that goes up three quarters of a percent so technology stock seem a little bit of a run and the as somebody is flat\nSo that's where we are right now will watch that on this October twenty second [noise] a couple\nOf things that I Want to point out to you I Know a lot of you're just joining us here for this third our but let me just point out that we've got some economic data coming out this week some of it pretty important some of it not so important but durable good numbers coming out this week that's a very important number that's when we want to watch closely\nKeep in mind that we had a door but good orders\nLast month ... that was a very good kind of off the charts so you know it's not likely that we're going to see that same kind of movement\nNow but certainly ah we we do have\nA durable good numbers we had a four point four percent last look on durable goods that was an August number\nSo\nI don't think September is going to be that that kind of number also the other thing is that we want to watch is home sales were getting new home sales coming out so home sales new home sales or we should see those numbers they're coming out right now we're hoping\nFor a good number doesn't look real good doesn't look like it's going to be a setting the world on fire that is for sure when it comes to new home sales so we'll we'll see where we end up\nThe big number coming out of friday friday we get a uh we\nProbably would I mean I ... and right now I Would get it I Would I Would probably stop the rider and get out when you can get out when you're getting out of surrender charges or getting close to being out of surrender charges or I Would I Would look again now\nThe other question was the uh I had over ten thousand you prefer so I'm pretty pretty well less than ... prefers but the ... been recommend to the like the caller is warning about going into prefers in the right now they're they're three to four dollars below par and I was just wondering uh that should be an incentive shouldn't it\nOr yeah it is it is it is it is an incentive no no no it is critical I mean it isn't a set of uh but here's the here's the risk if there is a risk I mean it's if you're like if it's like you wear and so many others that are in it for the income then there is no risk\nBut the real the real risk is that it doesn't get called for many many more years\nBut uh I wouldn't let that risk keep me if you really need the income and his situation because of his age and such um there was probably not the right thing to do right now I didn't think he was going to get out of that is a four one K. any way to do that but um\nI I yeah I mean that's a huge benefit that or this much below par and uh you know if you're going to get in now is a good time to do it and I think\nHe's getting a little bit of a bump today but I think they're going to continue to be um you know on the on the low side below par or for a while\nYeah pong time yeah yeah ... come back down which might not happen for many many years right\nExactly so there's no incentive for these companies to call it\nBecomes yeah why would I call it if I can last they just want to get out of debt so\nThere are there are companies that are going to say you know what we're doing really well things are going great we've had a good run let's get out of debt let's lower our art let's increase our free cash flow they call it\nAnd get out of debt and ... and pay it off so they can easily do that I've seen that happen before [noise] um I had a demeaning the energy\nUm preferred in in my IRA that went out of leather years pass a cold day I think we're ever going to call they call it a couple of years ago but it was a pain about eight percent\nSo you know I didn't care if they ever I was hoping they'd never call\nBut they did but it was primarily because they needed to shift some things around because of the buyout that they made some of the problems they had with their nuclear power stuff or some years ago they they needed to free up that money but we made it off but nonetheless [laughter] yeah\nI have a I haven't read it counts and has a couple of those are the present it and it may not have the the the uh the time horizon that he's you know request a if I have an opportunity to get out of the the ... are on the positive side would you recommend that getting out of that\nIs a is an ear to calculate the may not have that calmer as honest you request yeah you'll be yeah I mean it's not getting out of that\nIf only only if you can get out positive yes yeah if you can get a positive I Would do it just make sure she asked that your broker doesn't take the order and say okay and then ... without calling you to let you know what the business\nI never had that happened with the the marriage rate or our country and I never had them call back when I put order it for so long preferred by never had that situation happened\nDo well maybe they've gotten you know they've always been a case where they've sold at whatever it is you were looking at that day the market or how you and then they have no reason to cough that's the case but sometimes they won't call even if they get a bit lower um apologize\nLast last week for my derogatory comment about the\nNews now I Know you were under the table and do a lot worse than I Am just for a NATO or better yet\nRight All right Jeff by a push by the facts recalls alright sealer by a a former for seven or seven fifty five thirty three let me go to a Sondra from Arkansas\nThey sound to you when I got to put you on the air there you go go ahead\nOkay I can talk to you know talk to you about my annuity said I had in one company and you had asked\nA given me a suggestion that I might try Jamie it marriage right uh-huh which I which they are trying to just start starting with them but\nThey may be a great ... and you know I don't know a whole lot about it and I don't know what to do and I was wondering if you had any suggestions shell\nAnd I was wondering if you had any suggestions\nShow they are they trying to are you going back into an annuity with them you\n\nKnow you did a ten thirty five exchange yeah okay\nSo you are you're staying within the annuities because of what surrender charges or whatever the situation was I don't\nKnow yet to paint

detain individuals if your purpose who come to the United states has to live and work in the United states and you get relief\nYou've got to let you want it and it's a it's an incentive for those individuals to come to the United states we need to cut off those Meg that's the president's attempted to do it but Congress has stepped up the task and [noise]\nYou know frankly the fault is on them\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if it wanted to\nTo stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be enforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what other a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families so that their cases could be hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated out circa ... cases could eat that night and those folks can be returned to the United states they could also uh you know\nChange the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states and again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum in Guatemala they should be applying for asylum let's hope but there are in addition ah the ah the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where a company daily in a miners have to be released after twenty days\nUm Congress can you know step in and they can end the floor as a settlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they are ... and it doesn't matter if how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter it's it it's a it's an emotional manipulation game they want to they want to pull the heartstrings and America and put these Republicans back on their heels says okay you want to put babies in cages he want to put a baby how many times have we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... you know we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that in order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into the best facilities that we have available coverage can provide more money for\n\nThe trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous rapes robberies murders or the Obama administration when they had similar uh programs we saw NPR run articles about this we saw National Geographic of all things\nAre wrote an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all you see a little girl a pink shirt standing next to her mother crying as a border patrol agent make sure that her mother doesn't have any contraband that child travel through the night without food\nHow in the world any parent can subject their child but this horrendous drone states is beyond the ...\nWell when you when you see these four thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nPaying for this I think there is no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars it cost to\nGet to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect the administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though are you know doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states who are very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor this is another incentive again you went back to either of the people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their slug we're definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory verify that the keys the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to change that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so that was a good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum from Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is that the case if that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we're talking about you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God we're in the United states under orders for local they've received their due process or it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing\nEverything that they had coming to them they've had but they remain in the United states continue to work here again we have no ... no way\nTo verify that there are leading in\nIce just lack the resources to go out and find ones and twos these are people [noise] plus you you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under ... orders of removal\nYou know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the rap sheet that they're under a file order removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries\nBut everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work ... any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night art and he said that the folks in\nArt and he said that the folks in a Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter who travels with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he said well look I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and\nNever mention anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the coach coaching really occurs\nThat's where you get the you know the paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview so the script for everybody man woman and child seems to be the same and I fear for I think from my family that I'm going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions\nWants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that for a\nMind security bill I think it was attached to that bill [noise]\nYeah it but you know here's the other problem or is it the next year that's going to drop\nAbout Seventy five percent of all people who claim credible fear found to have credible here even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before\nThe problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear or something then\nUh they get referred over for torture convention claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a claims that at the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual is removed from the United states\nDa chest needs to give that authority back to ... or ah the Justice Department needs to give that authority back to the H. S. so that they can make determinations whether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical\nWell and also uh as as he or someone else made the point when someone claims domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing but think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's it's well it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse\nIt hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate a local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding and or a review in Texas or Arizona it's just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation of place that actually prevents the United states government says the gate and whether or not\nThat claimed took place in her country nothing that's contained asylum application can be disclosed to anyone outside of that asylum pursuing we'll leave very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries or if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nYes and a under a the TV puree the trafficking victims protection that we have to actually a handover unaccompanied alien minors to ha chess and agents or the department of the United states government that really doesn't\nDo this for a for a living\nAnd yet you know Congress back in two thousand and two decided that ha ha I should have this responsibility they don't do it very well its history a show so yeah we need to change

come to just to recap so some issues that would drive Republican turnout and maybe maybe even win over some Democrats\nDr noxious or yes but we'll remove it was a number of Democrats and many independents civil moving the third big issue for us is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me uh you know the dams as they now refer to them the Democratic

law in this election most of all by the way is one elected trumping sixteen a fear of returning\nThe country to the hands of the political class\nA elites and the sense of of losing what progress that that has been made and they they have that anti Washington anti elitism still exist in very great with\nThe issue has been from the Republicans can nationalize the election I still don't think I still think there's more they could do they could run national advertising with these things right\nStop and by the way it's cheaper to do\nAnd it's more effective because guess what when you buy network advertise you to be inside of shows rather than crammed into local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with this these commercials\nYou get to stand on your own but they need to nationalize because then Harris lay off year elections are\nAre off year elections are um tend to be for people who were in the out party that the ... the unhappy the disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade between the the\n... when you put the big issues in front of people have consequences then something happens and I think the Republican giving him all the candidates are doing a better job but frankly the passion and all those they have not gotten together\nTo do what they could do 'em to mash them further national\nPolite and now we have not\nJust the local election out is is it a national election and people need to understand the choices\nBecause there are concerns are very great again the Kavanaugh hearings beginning of the Supreme Court the driving people out of

our thing with a man and masculinity being attacked in the cabin out at at all\nYeah so I think there was a backlash I think that there is certainly a gender gap but it goes both ways and the man uh and and again I come back to it's not just wrapping up the Republican base there are huge numbers of independents remember the Trump carried\nIn twenty sixteen and a large share of Democrats who are not happy with the way things these the the prospects are going and it is an heritage really that those voters as well as the base\nBe exposed to the larger consequences of what happens if you will

B.\nThanks for listening to this bestseller financial issues welcome back to finance you issues I'm Dan Syria hey it's great to have all of your joining us for the third our we sure do appreciate it [noise]\nWe've got phone lines open a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three\nIt is September tenth\nMarkets or fly nothing happening so that's where we got nothing happening\nHey we've got a lot of economic do them a data coming out this week\nOr the most important piece of economic data this is just my opinion\nTo pieces I'll say one I'm kind of a non event I really don't care I I Do care very much about it it's very important but I'm reasonably certain it's going to be good I probably shouldn't say that\nBut and if I'd be the small business administration small business not administration small business and the national federation of independent businesses small business index\nAre coming out confidence index coming out and um\nI it's ... it's going to stay out by I Can't imagine this is an August number were sitting on a seven point nine or ... wait for all practical purposes\nCan't see it go much below that can't see him going much above that but it should probably I think the needles to move up a little bit from one o seven point not just because of the numbers that we've seen the other really important numbers industrial production\nAnd that's coming out that's also an August number so industrial production or one of the most important numbers we have in our economy\nOr something we watch very closely or we should be watching now we got in the habit of ignoring it or not we shouldn't say way I don't wanna throw me in that category 'cause I never ignored it [noise] but um the the mainstream\nA financial news gotten the habit of ignoring it because\nI'm the industrial production numbers kinda contradicted everything that was happening in the Obama administration so uh what all the things they were a towel team or the industrial production contradicted it and you do not by the way you do not a a a kind of almost any economy\nBut American economy\nHas no growth unless industrial production um and and and productivity if those two things aren't up you know really have any growth you could say have grows you always say I grew up and you can pretend like you have to grow you can do that too\nBut\nYou don't have any growth was it an interesting how about this\nPresident Obama\nTalking about this good economy is because of him wait a minute all the Democrats are saying this economy stinks all the Democrats on the ... say this economy is not good [noise] how can you say it's good and they're not and then they got a thousand reasons why this isn't a good economy\nSo ... ... ... who's right here so then President Obama didn't create a good economy Oh yes he did well then it does is say oh no it's things just say just thought I'd throw that out um\nI just found that interesting because you got to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on one side say and all the Trump hasn't done anything what is he talking about what a time and you've got\n\nPresident Obama saying buses or you know comedy is good but keep in mind that there might number\nOkay\nAll right we're going to have to fight that look if the if the left it was had any sense whatsoever\nThat would just kind of drift right on by right through this happened now morning she just keep talking about Russia how about that because you're just making fools yourself talking about this economy so why don't you just\nGet paid for the November elections talk about ... got to be something out there you can talk about um\nLet me think why don't you talk about um abolish the nice how about that how did you talk about the evils\nOf law enforcement there you go there's a winning and you talk about the evils\nMaybe maybe you can get that an eight hundred number that if people are being arrived that they can call instead of the police maybe ah you know\nSo the the um sprayed between the ten year and a two year is increasing you know everybody was talking to me and I didn't spend a lot of time on this because I didn't want to talk about it because I didn't think I thought it was irrelevant 'cause I didn't think I was going to happen and it didn't but they're spread between the two year and a ten year\nHas grown and continues to grow and let's hope we can hold\nSo yes the ten year moved up the yield but and so did the two year but the two year didn't move up at the same rate that the ten year did so therefore the difference the gap\nIncrease and that's a good thing as we look at the economy and I'm Sorry I don't have that uh exact number in front of me you know what I might have it for her to do about that so the ten year this morning hates wow free point to one quick point to one early this morning\nSo the two year had a hit two point eight to eight I remember when the ten year was two point eight eight this year not too long ago so\nBut the spray it had changed so that ten year increase five point seven basis points the two year increase to point for basis points so that increase that difference between the two in the den and that's very good\nAt the Federal Reserve power spoke yesterday and he said the economy is a long way away from neutral now\nMaybe some of you heard that and maybe some of you are right some things about that because I Know you're so much more in tune with economic data because you listen to this program but let me just explain to you and I hope we are\nSo neutral when you hear the term neutral when the Federal Reserve talks about it he's talking about the point at which interest rates this is their interest rates going up like they did last week raising\nThe interest rates\nNeither affect the markets where the economy in a good way nor do they affect the economy in a bad way\nWell that's kind of what happened I bully last week it really had no impact on the economy one way or another but the fed says no that up a chairman pal says no that is not the case at all we are a long way away from ...\nWe're a long way from neutral\nBeing that whatever the fed does really doesn't impact the markets that much [noise] the one thing I wanted to mention it to you and I I did a two minute on this and then I deleted it because it sounded too much it's sad to\nSay either too sarcastic means and mean spirited so\nI guess I was very early it was three o'clock this morning\nSo I listen to it it's in there and I think so but basically what I was talking about what's shaping Morgan came out and said that talked to was an article say J. B. Morgan says that ah the because of the Federal Reserve market cap and he has to be has lost one point five trillion dollars\nIn that uh Shay who cares\nYou really care what in the market was when they asked me it was all is up fourteen percent Fifteen Percent over the last twelve months\nOnly bank could whine about that there's a bank that has been living off cheap money for so long impacting their bottom line making billions\nAnd billions and billions and billions of dollars for the banks over the last seven years Steve ... these are the same fat cat bankers the President Obama despise for making so much money off of President Obama\n\nAnd they're whining about it oh no that sort of be terrible and oh my gosh yes and he's only up who cares about whether or money is impacting banks in the way they how much profit they are making\nAnd I thought they are what I like to think about was what a ridiculous statement to make Ninety two percent of people surveyed this year they don't trust the bank\n\nNow you know why this would be one of the reasons\nThis is why I talk about Christian Community credit union you're still dealing with a regular old but I think that the only Christian Community credit union you need to think twice about that I wrote an article about it when the survey came out a couple of months ago about this notion that Ninety two percent of the people that's worse than the ... rating in Congress\n\nI mean Congress ratings are higher than that not by a lot but there are higher than that there are at least somewhere in the low double digits eleven percent or so\nI guess Congress has more family and friends then do bankers\nThere are whining about what the fed the ... speaking in a very hawkish tone this is me saying that's not the banks not J. P. Morgan\nIn in a very hawkish tone this is me saying that's not the banks not J. P. Morgan but it's what they alluded to speak it at a very hawkish don't we've seen drops like we did yesterday a forty four\nPoint forty four percent oh my gosh\nAre almost half of one percent drops because the fed is losing market cap\nSays why people don't like the ... so I don't own bags front on the back so I have a couple of small community banks are but that's it\nAnd that was the first time in twenty five years when I put those banks are my broad list some\nFour or five years ago [noise] other than prefer\nI got to make one quick comment about prefer somebody asked me about this about prefer going down as a good time to buy short is if you're in an income portfolio\nFrom our website the income portfolio yeah it's a good time to um I to some of your prefers but remember why you're doing an income portfolio so what do you care about income what do you try to do get income what are you trying to do supplement your current income\nWhen you're trying to do increase your um a cost of living your your your spending that you had your discretionary income by getting your money to work for you by generating income that you're getting paid out on a regular basis and that income is using to supplement your\nYour all your other income that you received and that's why you're trying to do it so why do you care whether it goes down to twenty two dollars twenty five twenty dollars Eighteen dollars what do you care\nThe idea is forget about the principal keep the income flowing that's all that matters you're doing it for income it's going to come back\nOr it's going to get called are you going to get twenty five dollars a share\nBut please don't get discouraged if you get discouraged you shouldn't be in an income portfolio I've said this a thousand times I'm going to say it again because I keep getting emails about it if you care that much about your value please cell now\nAnd get into growth stocks and stop getting into income stocks because you obviously don't need income you need to grow some more and if you're looking for grows out of your income positions that are on my list your barking up their own tree 'cause it is going to happen\nSo also\nI Would imagine somebody mentioned to me that I have a stock highlighted in blue that is it an income stock but it's also a foundational stock and he asked the question was well it's a foundational stock as if a foundational stock couldn't be an income stock\nSo if you look very closely at those highlighted in blue that are foundational stocks and I I granted I don't blame anybody it's kinda hard to see trying to figure out a better way to do it maybe I'll Try change it at the right or something but I had to find\nThe lettering on that stock is in yellow\nTried to in case indicate that it is a foundational stock maybe I ought to highlight the whole thing and yellow and maybe put the lettering and blew that might be better maybe I should try that\nBut at this point I hate to confuse people but um that's that's okay that's happened to be a growth stock but the income that produces\nIs very good and and I would consider it an income stock but in the same line of thinking you can't be worried about growth you're doing it strictly for income don't be worried about growth if you're doing it for growth and you happen to get that income that's a wonderful thing\nOh let me go to Cathy Cathy calling us from Michigan had Cathy\n[noise] the morning and you hear me yes okay um\nI had a question I have a rough IRA and I'm the one\nAnd I'm Wondering about the allocation I have and that\nBut under that Seventy percent bond ten percent and never meant money market twenty percent so when do you think you're going to use the money\nOh not anytime soon\nI'm Sorry what was that a rat and I still okay [noise]\nUm yeah I mean I think that's fine I mean I I don't um [noise] you know I mean I think that's fine but it's pretty aggressive\nI mean I you know I Would hesitate a little bit but if you're if you're not going to use it I don't know what it what you think uh I mean I'm taking eight years ten years I don't know if that sooner not for you but uh if you're going to be leaving that money for the next eight to ten years then I wouldn't\nBe problem I Would ever too much of a problem with that if you think you're going to need it sooner I probably tear back on that Seventy percent [noise]\nIn the ... [noise] but you know more\nNow hopefully they can come to terms or do something some kind of can be getting a compromise may be making a promise it's not going to be a public promise but maybe make a promise to the United states that are going to revisit this\nIn a year and a half I don't know when there are elections are or over check it out John\nCanada's elections there there are elected prime minister\nCanada's elections\nThere there are elected prime minister when they hit anyway [noise] so maybe they can make some sort of promise they want some relief on steel and aluminum we want some relief on lumber some relief on on a\nDairy\nGet there's plenty to negotiate all\nThey want some relief on this whole idea of arbitration served as Mexico\nWe've got to have that I Believe that rules are important role and we got to have the ability to negotiate or to arbitrary or some violation in some way shape or form without having to renegotiate the entire deal\nI think we've reached compromise on the length of the deal how long this deal is going to last I think we reached some agreement on that\nSo we're making headway\nBut we gotta keep plugging away and we got to hope that we'd come alongside the EU right now I don't understand why we can't make start to make some individual deals right now without making an overriding deal when Europe offered us no tariffs on automobiles either way we should have taken it [noise]\n\nPresident Trump said it's not enough it's OK let's talk about what the left and negotiate that as well\n\nBut he's quick to say it's all just make a separate deal with Mexico how about we just make a separate deal on cars with Europe and make separate deals on steel with Europe and make separate deals on batteries with your makes separate deals on\nOn a windmills with your I mean that's just a if we're going to do that that will take each deals they tell them\n\nWe're not going to get to a place where there's no tariffs on anything for anybody\n\nThat's not going to happen I Can't believe the president's would be naive enough to think that's going to happen I don't think he is I'm sure he's ... he's got enough smart people I Know some of them around them that are going to work on a by that\nI Would think\nEuropean stocks I don't know where they finished the day by European stocks were lower early on in the day China's got major issues right now they're talking about ... they're just one point five points away from being in contraction mode\nIn their in their service sector\n\nThat is a huge problem since they've been working feverishly trying to build their service sector so that they can grow their economy through service sector and not all to manufacture and not be so heavily dependent upon manufacturing exports\nWell guess what is dropping quick why because nobody's got any money\n\nThey're losing their discretionary income as a matter of fact a lot of people in China losing their income altogether we're not hearing about that we can hear about that that that we have no way of hearing about that\nBut we got to know that they're manufacturing a production of slowing down the service sector now slowing down that means people are losing jobs I mean people are starving to death to literally\n[noise] so\n\nThere's gotta be room for negotiation in these areas\nNow we've got worries about emerging markets we see South Africa's economy slipping into a recession kinda snuck up on everybody\n\nWhat's the next we've got to worry about some of the other emerging markets\n\nThen we've got currency issues with emerging markets that we've got to be concerned about\n\n[noise] anyway [noise]\nWe've\nGot to look at what a individual investors what consumers wife was um [noise]\nBusiness investment as looking like that's going to be going to be very very very important numbers\n[noise] if money [noise]\nSome significant changes on the damn [noise]\nFor for several [noise] this\nIs Nancy where you're from financial issues like every ministry we need to raise the poor to continuing the war\nOne of the ways that we do that is we asked you to help support them industry by be coming

necessarily represent the needs of the stations for people who show sponsored [noise]\n\nCome back financial issues aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three of course that news media um\nWell the the a conservative news media what what little bit there is left is talking about\nUm\nBuildup of China's military and they've been talking about it for a little while last couple of weeks um [noise] I saw an article coming out of a Greek a newspaper that was printed in English\nOh an article coming out of a Greek a newspaper that was printed in English talking about this very thing because they're concerned Greece concerned about the navy and build up [noise]\nUm you know China's goal and you might not know this is that by in Twenty years to a completely control um have the power to control the oceans\nAre with a naval build up or they want the total control right now today over the Asia Pacific and um they they pretty much have that and as you may or may not know earlier this year I think it was yesterday maybe it was early this morning but yesterday I'm\nAlmost collided with a navy destroyer\nI'm In international waters that was over in the Asia Pacific uh and you can actually see a satellite photographs\nOf the two ships now satellite photographs so the depth perception is not the best but by looking at the photograph it looks like they are unbelievably close so I'm sure there are very close and you know the the um\nChina needs they will protect those oceans and the Asia Pacific in any means I can\nAnd they continue a massive you think you know we're going through a military build up here that is up now forty years overdue we've got a navy that is equivalent to what we had in World War two I Know that's hard to believe but we've we've let it go\nOur air force in our air power has diminished greatly although we are working to build it up\nAs somebody because of President Trump either way\nOr

to get into the home studying act\nYou could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever and with the uh that already having a priority on any old studying at the opening up your could wind up with a lot of our own studying which would be helping all the Americans and at the same time\nPut one hell of a wall dollar\nA than other interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman Democrats just want an open border open borders open markets don't go on\n\nThe moon is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity if\nYou're in depth and you need help cold trinity of one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three something to talk to a certified comes when\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether\nCommunity will consolidate your accounts to the one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop to late season over limit charges reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors or being able to pay off to Fifteen thousand dollars in Alaska Eighteen months\nBy now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that Chris ... a prime time last night Steve Cortez as a warrior ... for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino and his ... his parents\nCame here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I look to see him as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of them death threats I'm certain scheme gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and your um but uh the ... the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again ... ... people who work hard for a living\nTry and take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much under the president's leadership and then on the other side they see chaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism or an embrace of the illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nTo see now with that term and coming toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met last trip back during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and\nIt was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country and and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump have backbone and\nWould never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh and you saw what happened when the president just said simply no I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve\nAnd confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and the senators we didn't even think Adam anymore Lindsey Graham was the hero of German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down the stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they started to come play like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it the day\nBut it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch bucket to work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nNow you're listening to your health the radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done the last few years on immigration shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people a year it's a lot\nOr or to be decreased so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain as saying that the Gallup poll from June thirty seven percent want that level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration\nTwenty nine percent want it decreased okay\nTwenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration and that those are the convenient facts inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration as it doesn't affecting your life\nYour kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nA and driven a school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less\nSo you know people don't want this\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's a very blue collar area and a ... and ... year a year or so we've seen\nTruckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested at a seven eleven\nOn their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants in and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them cash\nOn e just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crackdown needs to continue because I'll tell ya in western New York and buffalo where we used to be a strong steel worker town\nWere not anymore we're we're starting to come back to the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here me these jobs me these jobs and and the they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats and the mainstream media spend their time trying to\nLight them on this issue talking about how important are ... immigration to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're complaining as illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration\nEither go illegal immigration and I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process but first the immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it and the problem\nIt's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it and the problem she sees as it sees around and people were all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now over ... ...\nIt's ... it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly ... it's you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right up border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but\nLook the chaos at the at the border\nIs is not dissimilar\nAh Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... and the aftermath of Kavanaugh are and the Democrats prefer that because if this chaos you need more government government grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier\nThan when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\n[laughter] it's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh\nWas screaming in the hearings but the people running down the uh the always the basement of the United states Capitol screaming at senators but the people trapping senators in an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras\nThe mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed but people trying to literally ... their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building if they like that\nThey're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans wouldn't lose the house because a lot of people who were not measure well by the polls him twenty sixteen they\nCall a deplorable is right that people who haven't voted in recent election because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all they found a champion and Donald Trump someone made for a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in the mid term election\nThose kinds of folks to tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a a skip the ... the birthday party after work to go vote\nOn it and and this time around they better do it because they think of the president's not I'm about ... is\n... now and that's an excellent point and Michael what's happening in the twenty seventh congressional district in New York Congressman Chris Collins what's happening there\nWell Collins as some of your listeners might know or was charged with insider trading yup I'm a recently after it was too late to get them off the ballot um you know he'd declares is in a sense from you know we believe in the opposite of antiseptic but near twenty seven is an hour plus eleven district that was a safe seat\nAnd they have a pretty strong Democrat running against them kind of lean toward the Democratic socialist side of things really hates Donald Trump has said he's open to impeachment\nAnd he's changed his tune because ...

five forty Laura we're going to bring your attention to critical races across the country one of them as Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where\nMarty no Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat left the Susan Wild\nAnd this has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty as a person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also is an avid cyclist within the two thousand\nUh Olympics as attract cyclists does a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration trade all the rest are Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nLower first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every quarter of this district which is now a new district pencil in the seventh district uh it says everything from the urban core of Allentown from an eastern to the\nCause of farming communities in the northern tier worked district called asleep built a region now what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is uh\nFor work district what we call this late felt a region\nOr what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they're happy with what our president's been able to accomplish we're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know as a rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now\nA lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake if they flip the house I'm a ... in in Congress\nWhat what uh when when you see the redistricting that but obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add a urban voters to what it's traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district\nIt makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to try to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration what we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth people don't like this chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\n\nI think that's really on a lot of people's minds is just that the radical a resistance we're seeing from the left\nA rash of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen um most people I'm Talking to I Would say the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform\nUh we need to secure our southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was supportive at\nA show immigration up here in Lee high value in the seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty Susan Wild is they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because the me too movement the woman's march and so forth so ... what would they tried to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nSo that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary or somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move to the center but a a result speak\nFor themselves or you know she she's she's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy and\nBureaucracy you know from ... in the president to teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she won't state or any public forums but at the end of the day that's what she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth has been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American worker\nThe American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI I've been watching some of your a campaign or commercials in advance on line\nAnd the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks and smashing car windows and\nAnd uh in raising the flags of other countries in America they want America to be a safe prosperous nation where security\nIs paramount in our our virtue is freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I\nThink it's job not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that the results we've seen in the\nPrimaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up in ... uh we we announced a campaign um our our\nGrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters\nThe night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in ... district which in my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old\nBut what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is it is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd funded funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America's standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty no stain or might Marty Nothstein I Can't wait to see you in Congress\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity dead management\nMy story began with that and a lot of credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're in depth and you need help coal trinity one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three seven\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I look at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical that that was in my life would go way\nCommunity will consolidate doing accounts to the one easy to manage monthly payments reduce your interest possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands what I\nWould tell people please pick up the phone and call China and just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy and has to pay off your gas and\nLoses in Fairfax County Virginia and she's behind them is a congressional race reelection\nIf she loses I saw something on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies follow always liberal policies always follow wear a mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the\nAh African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll will tell us that immigration is adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has so I'll give you that a stat and just a moment Dr Marc Christian is with us or he is a director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni\nWho converted from Islam to Christianity\nAnd he's been following the media and their use of manipulation of this story from turkey wearing a Saturday counsel at the Saudi journalist who wrote for the Washington Post\nOr is or was murdered and apparently it's on Donald Trump's fault\nDr Christian good to have you with us out what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're now they're just affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nCigarettes for having me editor for the shit a fortune in the ... and you're right when you have a party that is owned by by then and uh uh you know all those all the guards it's it looks like they are often from inside\nWhen I I think actually this um you know story about a ... a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we're not going to get the truth out there and and the reason of that has this when you know many people actually don't understand you know the situation between the states and Saudi Arabia and try to a point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the radicals and\nAnd also to dictators and so forth which is far from too if you listen to Trump in his last quarter on his before this incident broke out\nEmbarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and that was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East\nSo uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nUm back in the south is because he loves loves the dictates of his all for personal gain because this is nonsense is doing this because the Saudi Government the government the government is doing a good work that helps that are not states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from bite and then Obama and all of those previous president with a lot states\nAnd why I'm saying that because you and you look at what the current um gung Britain's and the Saudi Government is doing their head thinking many fronts their number one is\nThey are helping by defending the Islamic movement by putting a in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all\nThe fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries there had been denied stage um\nWhen they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east\nThey're helping big time they get on the Iranian sanctions are and how the Trump is putting those on\nBy living oil prices in an all look up stuff also the current administration will kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty\nThat never ever been imagine before and Donald Trump is about to announce that are very very soon what is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's in Egypt and Israel which is gonna be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years so Donald Trump is supporting um you know the gun on\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those seasons and on and all of those\nHead for the United states not that dictatorship on job or plus adding to all of this we believe in this country that everybody is innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as when we have to follow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know\nI I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since the great in the United states but still ... over there and my ... in my home brew which\nYou know nothing happens by coincidence\nWhen uh the president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time\nAfter the Trump Administration embarrassed him publicly and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the the pasture and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of\nThis incident going taking place excellent point\nWell I think again mark in America in ... in the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the ... which again it's it's ... it's so sad and it's so predictable they always go to racism they always go to see in a phobia they this is all they have it's it's\nWomen are oppressed in the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ... I mean it's so\nPredictable that it's almost boring to talk about but meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people who are about to cross into America unless we do something about this thousands and thousands of people\nMany of them this is an adult men for young a military age men who are have joined this caravan in or being supported by someone or some

way and then right after that they start talking about the curve and\nMarching to the board that of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to divide and to try to uh make the

transpire so many things going on a it looks like a turkey is a working to create a little bit more instability in the currency ah markets they're doing a good job of it and then that's exactly what is happening this is going to have a far bigger impact\nOf\nFor a bigger impact on on the euro zone that is a fear of something we've got to watch very closely all week long\nAnd you know I Know there's a lot of people that have email me and I remember one time about\nOh I'm going to go back six eight ... no longer in that 'cause it was last year I'm going I'm going to say it was probably a December November December last year\nAnd I was talking about what you're back to the reports were coming out of doors your bag and other things going on somebody emailed to say you know I I I Wish you'd stop talking about that it's got its so irrelevant I'm In ...\nThe folks I very seldom and I can say I do is not very seldom I probably more times that I Wish I Do talk sometimes about some things that might be fairly irrelevant but from an economic perspective I'm so at some point in time we've gotta we've gotta ... we've got to decide a couple of things\nAnd we've got to decide how is our economy going to get better is going to get better from the inside or is it going to get better from the outside of what I mean by that is are we going to do things internally here in the inside of our economy to make things better exactly like we're doing right now for our external forces\nLike a stronger euro zone\nA stronger Asia other economies around the globe gonna help contribute to us being\nA stronger economy and we need to take a look at the same time\nAt those things are going to help the rail our economy if it's a good one I Believe our economy is a good one right now I'm not talking about the markets and talking about the economy I Believe our economy is a good strong healthy economy right now\nSo one of the things that we've got to make a decision about is what could be well the economy what could the rail the efforts of this administration is it going to be eternal internally or is it going to be extraordinarily internally\nWould be things like the pure hatred for this president creates an environment where the president can't get anything done or the agenda can be achieved that would be one thing that could derail our economy\n\nCould you be tariffs that are so severe on our industry which I don't know of any coming down the road that could derail the economy certainly that could happen could it be the Federal Reserve getting carried away with interest rates the railing the economy\nCould the Federal Reserve getting a carried away with interest rates create a hyper inflation\nThese are all internal things that could change the course of the economy in a heartbeat\nAnd I have to say it's a very thin wire that this economy is walking along\nCould fall very easily\nExternal things are going to be things like financial crisis in other parts of the world that are going to impact us\nWhy so if there's a major financial crisis in Europe we would be extremely naive to go about our merry way and think that it's not going to impact the United states market why because finance makes the global economy go round and we're part of the global economy\nAnd if there is a financial crisis\nIn another major developed developed economic zone like the euro zone which is made up of twenty eight developed nations than we need to be concerned about that that in in of itself is a largest economy in the world\nNot any individual country in the eurozone but the euro zone in of itself I think it's a tornado they get\nBut that moment that I opened up the shoe box and looked at my items for the first time I realize that the song that I Would thing over and over that that somewhat so very true that Jesus didn't love me and he did notice me in the middle of this orphanage because of the shoe box\nWhat was that like what are some of the things in his shoe box that immediately grabbed your attention\nThe coloring books in crowds opening for the first time to seeing so many colors that stuffed animal that was the favorite and my most favorite while I Am in my shoe box was\nGetting my own at his fresh before because I knew I no longer had to share one brush with ten other girls well but that stuffed animal the reason I Love that the blast because missionaries a town\nAnd they would say I love you and give us hugs but when they weren't there to give us hugs we had that stuffed animal that we can carry around with us from snuggle with us night\nWell it's so important and then and and that's one of the things on the list yes that is so important to try to get into a box or if if you can I Know from Avon and our our uh our experience of being there we\nWe uh we think of those stuffed animals dolls that the kid got them when we saw them opening up shoe boxes and soccer ball cattle or your favorite [laughter] yeah they were there were huge so uh we we try we try to do that um so tell us about your journey to Christ\nUm to come into the saving grace of of Jesus was it as did that that comment came after the shoe box the first shoe boxes you got I suspect\nYes so I only got one shoe box and when I realized that Jesus loves me that ... that the shoe box they planted that seed of hoping my life and realizing OK\nThis Jesus that I've heard about maybe he is true and maybe there is something to that but I was young I was five and didn't fully understand more than that and then at the age of six that was adopted and now living in Maryland and my family taught me more if we're that Jesus was that I had had a glimpse of\nAnd developing that personal relationship and ultimately are asking price to be into my heart so it was a journey but it started because of that shoe box\nWell and now you speak around the country you know for for operation Christmas show and share your story\nAnd help motivate people to pack boxes in folks we we need everybody listening if you go to the website financial issues died or our website\nAnd you click on that operation Christmas Child a better it is so important\nUh that you do that I mean this means and now today when they get the shoe boxes Jackie [noise] um they also have an opportunity for the greatest journey right yes so so tell us about that\n[noise] so what I Love it that it's more than just the shoe box and more it's more than just showing loving hoping a tangible way but showing love and helping in eternal way with every shoe box that's given the child receives a booklet called the greatest gift and they're they learn about Jesus from creation to the cross\nAfter the first distribution the children by a to return to their local area for a twelve lesson disciple shut program\nAnd they're they learn what it means to faithfully be a follower of Jesus Christ and at the end of the twelve lessons that children graduate they perceive us or convicted and a New Testament Bible and their own language so from their their challenge to share what they've just learned\nWith their friends and with their families so because of the greatest journey we are creating disciples around the world and helping local pastor's because of operation Christmas Child nutrition or being able to start a communities are being transformed and the\nKingdom of God is growing\nYou know that's what I Love about Samaritan ministries is that Samaritans per se is that they they don't just give a shoe box and go away\nOr they ways up the way ahead of the shoe box is getting to a particular village or a particular town\nAnd they have raised that pastors local pastor's there that are going to teach this this ah greatest journey these twelve lessons and to start to grow disciples for Jesus Christ and that's the greatest bussing obviously yes all of all of this and and that's why we do it\nAh to share the love of Jesus first with the children as you felt\nAnd to share the gospel message of Jesus Christ ultimately and they hopefully will grow up\nTo be a fully devoted followers uses Christ you know what a what a blessing and a we've been we've had opportunities to be at some of the centers where they're giving out these eve on and I have\nAnd uh it is an incredible thing to see and how many shoe boxes um did they did they did last year do you do you know\nLast year the number I Believe was twelve million\nLast year the number I Believe was twelve million ... [noise] but since Nineteen Ninety three we've sent out over a hundred and fifty seven million shoe boxes Taylor a hundred countries and to think that that number is still continuing to grow\nIt is amazing and a folks there is a church near you that is a distribution center\nOr that you can you can pack you can you can do a couple of things when you go to that linked financial issues died or click on that link\nAnd I'll take your rights to Samaritans purse slash OCC right and it'll take you to that you can pack a box on the line\nSo you can do that online if you want that box will be packed you'll pay for a ... a small amount to do that and you can pack a box on line or better yet\nHe bought an eye on now will do eight this year for our eight grand grandchildren\nAnd a pot that box the older grandchildren we will I'm a want them to participate in that and we can take that to our church our church has to happen to be a collection center and we can take that to the church and somewhere there's a church near you when you can get that information on the Web site\nAt um oh OSU Samaritans verse slash ... Americans first outta work slash OCC or go to financial issues\nDot org and click on the banner and you'll be able to do that and on that you'll find a whole list of things that would would uh we'd want you to pack and we're going to go through some of those things Jackie's pointed out a little stuffed animal that she received and how much that meant you how many years did you\nDid uh you you carry that around and have that that will that\nAnimal didn't lock me as long as I had hoped to because of the boys at the home never mean and they would feel our toys from us\nYes I'm not sure um it is it is amazing to see their their faces and this gift to remind them of the gift of Jesus the gift that we we get and I love to Jackie said that it ... it really kind of showed the love of\nCrises that you had been singing about\nYep uh for for us so ... some years you were left off of that orphanage when you were just a baby is that right yes yeah\nAnd you've got this at age five yeah and then a year later you were adopted yeah and you were here and grow up in a Maryland yeah right here so that's that's wonderful what a blessing um\nWhen we pack a shoe box there are a lot of things that I Know we'll talk about this year in the next segment but when we talk\nPack a shoe box there are certain things that we don't put in and that list is also on the website right say yeah that\nJust a reminder of things that you don't put in like guns in war time\nKind of ah things and candy you had all melt per go bad and things like that so you get that a complete list here isn't what are some of the uh things that you would tell our viewers when they pack their bags boxers some of the things that they need to be\nPraying about thinking about and and participate in it\nDefinitely to begin with prayer\nBecause prayer is the foundation of everything in life than to pray for the child that will be receiving your shoe box to pray that God will lead you to the right items because I Know a lot of times people say well if I pack wool hat no scars well I go to our country or if I thought flip flops to like go to the cold country\nAnd you know got already has that story written and you're just being a vessel to complete that story\nAnd sometimes those items will go to a hot country but God has a three written a child that needs to be reminded that even though I'm he's missing some fingers that those gloves that he's put on his hands he can see this ten fingers and that's what he needs to see or the child has been praying to give his mom a gift and\nWe're seeing is hot pink flip flops in his shoe box and so he was finally able to give his momma get those items in those stories are out there and the guy had some already written\nYeah isn't that that is so amazing and um we've heard stories over letters and things that have been sent and followed and um the circle of that they make you know to to come back to the person that Packer\nBox you know it's just incredible and when you hear their stories you know one thing for certain\nThat can always be a ... after we're going to pack a couple of boxes one for a a girl and one for a little voice the bonds gonna come out here and\nParticipate in that health and law trying to go through a show you some day and hopefully will motivate you right now during this place a website\nSo we like to say something that if it harms a child um we won't accept or if it harms the shoe box um that that's what our rules are the war toys\nBecause of this shoe box is going to war torn areas and we don't want to hurt the child that way liquids that can hurt the shoe box and then can days into space that will hold up shoe boxes that customs ... to stay away from those there's plenty of other things to include right\nAt customs ... to stay away from those there's plenty of other things to include right\nYeah even think about customs because that's a whole nother a story and I know that\nWe were packing one night at our church a tractor trailer of shoe boxes and one of the the the men at the church there were leading this in his prayer\nI don't know if it was before or after we were backing prayed the costumes for it said something about customs and make it would it would get through customs and quickly that's really important to think about as well yeah absolutely\nUm [noise] this is going to how many countries over a hundred countries you know wow it's amazing\nAnd bags backpacks those small little backpacks\nI Would suspect they're good they're all good things\nYeah mhm anything that's easily roll up into the shoe box\nIf if someone said to you [noise] [noise] for a girl and a boy if\nYou know what would be the well item that that um I I Know one is difficult to narrow it down to but what's the one thing that that would be great to put in there\n[noise] the one thing that would be great to put into a shoe box\nI think a toy of some sort because we didn't get many of them and so far child to have their own soy it's just amazing something that they can carry around whether it is that stuffed animal or that soccer ball but\nWhat's the hundred and fifty seven million shoe boxes that had been sent out what I Can't pinpoint that every one of us had that same wow All right I never liked because of our situations I'm\nSpeaking from seeing all the children or the other one of these it really didn't matter right they were so thrilled every child was equally is thrilled with what they were receiving\nAs you know the next child even though there were so many different things and it was such a such an effect so oh go ahead\nA letter and a picture as the favorites some of the kids that receive shoe boxes when I got one they had pictures and letters and some some of the letters were able to translate it and the pictures that kids would run around all day and say look I Love my family\nAnd a growing up they often edge if you've ever wanted to protect anything you would hide it onto your mattress that night and so at night that picture would go under the mattress and then the next day at the same thing the letter would be shown around in the picture book I Am a lot of look at my family and other states\nWell that's that's great and it's\nSomething that we we don't we don't think about right and if somebody out there wants to call and for those notes leave a note or verse you have an idea I thought do that call and now you can do that on our call in line for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three most important we\nGet to some merit pins purse dot org\nBackslash O. C. C. or you can go to our website on our website and click on the band or it's going to take you right there and it's going to give you some of the things you'll ... you'll find everything you need\nTo pack a box and tell us a little bit Jackie about tracking the box because we you can they can track their box right\nYes so you can pay that nine dollars shipping donation on line and you'll get a bar code that you can place on your shoe box and it'll have a Q our code\nOnce that box goes to the processing center that you are coded scanned\nAnd it'll um track as to what country it's going to once it received it does to that country you'll get an email to say Hi your shoe boxes sent to Burkina Faso or your ... bucks distance to wherever in the world and so it's so fun to see the players to buy them up and you can learn more about that country and\nThen you could be more specific about your reaction to what you're praying for ... and I just wanted to say the most important thing once again
