A. as it's sometimes referred to back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan\nWhere people maintain high levels of ha and are famous for their ability to defy the aging process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with you pat and all your statements to introduce the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic assets supplements well of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update\nAnd an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this support in particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where the body actually is highly concentrated in ha\nBut I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because there's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said\nFree offer today from purity products no strings attached this is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nIt's amazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H. S. A. it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it\nAnd to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate that women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and that's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do\nAnd you see the skin shoveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course parity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joint\nH H joint formula and it's so important today because I think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternative we need cushioning in between the joints\nIt's two people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space\nBetween the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an inch space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age a is it the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief the more pain relievers we use the\nMore we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... fluids\nThey actually inject descended joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement\nPurity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of\nSix million paper clips put together its big you can absorb and purity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at a laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added way that we are going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nBut the ha revolution has come here path and of course we've had three years of use of ha but we could lose people in the science so they want to know what's real is this for real\nWell it's real for Tom who writes to us a pharmacist now from Santa Cruz California Seventy years of age participating in the whole lie Iron Man contest in Kona, Hawaii this past year\nSeventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joints did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no here's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty five boy when I tried ha I'm now back to playing full court basketball but the twenty year old\nAnd I've even begun to jog again these are the kinds of reports that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the ... and there's another one out of that is pretty popular MSN how does this agency stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take them for a while before you even see any results do and\nMost of these are very positive dietary supplements they certainly have lots of benefits ... takes quite a while to kick in\nMSN is a wonderful sulfur compounds and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil and so these are all wonderful\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joint and if we can just replaced it if we can find a way to get that cushioning back that's what we call usefulness that's what we had when we were young\nHere's David right into me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help support\nHis lower back and of course he said I Can't believe it now he says I Can't thank you enough for this product people have tried all the alternatives they've searched everywhere else pat and they haven't heard of highly ironic gas at\nNow the reorder rage on aging sort of tell me that things are phenomenal the product works and study shows how but\nOne of the customers and what are they telling you candidly what are they seen the bill's already\nIf the horses come back to the trough there must be good water there it's amazing to me how people say just keep sending death it's wonderful it changed my life\nHere is Lorraine saying I Can't believe it but I'm able to run I Love it\nRun five miles a day of my skin nails are great\nTelling everybody about it these are on the line you can go see some of these comments purity

disease and maintain those flexible health a youthful arteries for wonderful circulation hasty they want a boost their energy and you wind not I mean we deserve it and that's what we're going to be talking about here today with this crow omega\nFifty plus which is the cutting edge\nCombination Steve crude oil which is so fabulous for us but we infused the crew well not so important we didn't fused with the high omega three concentrated Fishell you need to do that when you're dealing with cruelty cruise cruel just isn't high enough\nThey don't make it through so many other important parameters virtues but\nYou got to get that high omega three fish are on there and we've done that so this is now the best of both worlds but we didn't stop there for the fifty plus years we've had a true vitamin D we doubled the antioxidant power and Steve we actually increase the microwave seven percent so this now becomes the finest omega three nutrients in the world as far as I'm concerned\nThis is very very exciting this cruel oil sensation I mean it is all over the news docked in the eleventh grade studies are out there are many experts are declaring that cruel oil is better

combination of cruel world with the omega three highly concentrated issue also which is much higher\nAnd omega threes and most cruel oil formulas would be so when we're dealing with the higher omega three fish oil we're talking about support for the HDL cholesterol\nHealthy useful flexible arteries that's so great for the circulation of heart muscle ...\nBull flexible arteries that's so great for the circulation heart muscle strength platelet activity red blood cells that stay nice and soft and flexible so they're going to work their way through those little ... what about triglycerides that becomes so important so\nThis criminal fifty plus supports the heart in so many ways\nAnd you know the bottom line is we need to think about this because as we're getting a little older fifty plus maybe mid forties certainly sixties and seventies\nIt's decision time I mean you know your body's not working the way it did when you were in your thirties energy might not be there if you need to

concentrated and they're all true obscure aside\nBut the special offer it gets even better as Dr Lehman told you you were one of the first one thousand college from this weekend's radio show purity is going to give away a free bottle of their delicious B. twelve energy mouse\nHas a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon\nIt greatly enhances joined tell so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse this really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that Kirk human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these agents in the brain that protect the actual to issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other Kirk human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion is one of the most life enhancing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just\nDecades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I Know that we turn to oversee the green tea in the current human your new green tea yarn liquid ... formula which purity given away for free today but first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the rich getting richer all which is super hot right now here with some of the headlines and the science behind her spiritual I Know some red wine and French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does it is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows\nUp and cranberries what we know about ... ... is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant\nBut more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body that happen during aging as a result of fat accumulation in tissue and insulin sensitivity ... helps to protect against\nThose things it's a powerful immune regulator\nAnd you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us\nHealthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this\nIs why it's considered one of the keys to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but ... appears to be\nKey in that and additionally there is a brain benefit like there is with the curriculum and with blood flow to the brain\nSo when you take resveratrol you'd get brain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nAgain we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well\nChristmas laser in on how this wonderful formula you greeted injunction maturity ... I Know that ... he's been a business now for\nWhat is it over Twenty years ago to chop reading the better Business Bureau and people can get complimentary bottled up this green T. C. R. today we'll get that number out in a few minutes but first\nWhat does this she are seeing foreign second you designed this formula in a liquid ... why do you like the liquid soft technology so much\nOkay first questions first it's called green tea CPR which is short for green tea Kirk human and there is there a troll\nThe big three ingredients that are in this product and meaningful protective amounts the reason that it's in a liquid soft shell is that that allows for rapid and very complete absorption\nI'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with tablets or capsules that contain powders because there isn't but when\nYou have a fluids soft shell you just happen to get more quick break down of the capsule more rapid absorption and to some extent more complete absorption into the intestines\nThat means that your body utilizes more of the ingredients in the supplements so Rene tc are as green tea Kirk human ... and the reason for a liquid soft shell is it's just a superior dosage form especially for these three particular ingredient\nOf course before we tell our listeners how they get their very own complimentary bottle of green tea see our show me this you wanted to buy this green tea plus the patented B. C. M. Ninety five ... human plus the spiritual I mean you spent close to properly least Seventy five dollars for all three bottles and store\nAnd yet today purity products is giving away free bottle how are
