eye\nHow do you change their heart\nAh then how do you predict whether or not because there are plenty of people filled with actual hate\nWhen we don't mean people on social media just talking you know negatively about someone we mean people filled with actual hate\nThat are potentially deadly well there are a number of last week it passed to keep because uh you uh you know this guy was on a apparently a a social media site I'd never heard of a that was ... was a social media site for white supremacists\nAnd\nOkay so your we could say that participation in such a site\nOr is against the law we could say that I'm speaking out with hatred in your heart real hatred for groups of people are based on their ethnicity or or or culture that's against the law we could pass a number of laws send it I mean how do you change your\nFreedom of speech ... part of the reasons that freedom of speech speech exist is so people do proclaim what they think so you know who they are you know exactly how they all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground that's what you do\nAnd and when there's pressure from you know society because the reason may be a I'm guessing the reason and I think it's a solid theory here that the neighbor wasn't aware of of this kind of you know hatred in this person's heart\nIs because in our society\nWe don't tolerate it morally speaking forget about the legality of it all forget about what can be done legally morally we don't tolerate that because the overwhelming majority of people don't have this kind of hatred and evil and there are no\nAnd you cannot ... and and that's what it comes down to there's there's no way of knowing for what ever reason whatever motivation a person might have\nI mean think of all of the reasons that might be stated a in terms of the motivation of of any\nMass killer in our history\nWell the list is very long\n[noise] you know I I was just I was going through the headlines are just yesterday just in real clear politics and and it was a it was just really interesting a Donald Trump is a shameless liar\nThat's the headline of an article written by former president Iraq Obama got his my witnessed or no one family Detroit News be honest we hate each other\nBut the one I liked the most was just in Fox Bloomberg's headline if you ignore the news America actually seems pretty nice\nIf you ignore the new view ignore the news seems pretty nice ... well I I just I thought it was you know I didn't even read the article I just I saw it but I but it it's something that you and I've talked about before where we've we've said\nAh for and and I mentioned for example everything went out on the news and you walk into the voting booth everybody greet you how you doing what's going on you know you're voting location what's going on good to see a\nOh the weather's bad Oh thanks for voting pick up your thing thanks you take care oh have you don't have I mean everybody goes and it's very orderly very nice but I don't think I've ever had a non pleasant time ever voting in my life right but that's actually the reality of a you know of of what goes on\nFor the vast majority tens of millions of people out there one thing we talked about you know the the news media\nAnd you and I have talked about this a lot that they're always you know and and it just because it's it's it's the news the news is watch unusual that's one of the first things I learned in journalism class is news is the unusual right that's why that's why murders\nAre news mhm because for the most part they don't happen to the vast majority of people not to discount that murder isn't bad but the fact is the majority of people the majority of the time never encounter a a a murder right many some families do but\nThe majority of families in\nThis country do not when you look at the three hundred and roughly thirty million people in this country still mass shootings mass murders are quite\nLow but when you look at the uh\nPsychopaths that exist out there\nUh when I was just watching and how many uh documentaries every watched on it but it was another one on on Ted Bundy yesterday\nAnd talk you know ... going through the transcripts of his girlfriend at the time I'm telling you just haunting yeah she was trying to figure out\nIs he\nIs he not named going through that progression of her there's no it can't be and then sent you know since he's brother ... the Ted 'cause the exact same thing shuts the\nDoor on the FBI and you know how dare you this isn't this isn't my brother and then finally you know started thinking about it and said well\nOkay I guess I have to deal with reality\nAnd it's not that it gives any you know um there was no owners ... or ... or responsibility on the part of his\nBrother necessarily because it was as if you know he was learning it ... he really was learning about you know what his brother might be capable of doing or was capable that turned out of doing a A N and that's the case with any of them you know the neighbor here\nOf the shooter at the at the synagogue\nYou know you think of that and I'm sure in in his mind these wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to you know\nClose or is there something that I could have done we all do this and by the way this is how we get to this point I was saying there must be a solution because\nIn our hearts there should\nBe one this in our hearts it doesn't make sense but we're trying to make sense of something that will ... the overwhelming majority of people will never be able to connect with in our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil\nThe able to connect with in our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil in our hearts we don't have this kind of hatred for people it's quite the opposite we have love and respect for people and we can talk about disagreements but I always put it like this it's like a family\nYou could sit around and and if you go spend you know enough time [laughter] with your family you can sit around and you can have debates and you can have concerns and arguments and very passionate arguments on very important things\nBut the moment somebody else walks in that door and starts threatening interview and starts going after any of you that's when you stand up together and say wait a minute hold on here because when you put this all in perspective\nWe're always going to have very passionate discussions about American politics that's going to be the case in we should be the case\nWhen you talk about the the tactics right now being used\nDo away with the process do away with the constitution do away with the electoral college all of these things that are ultimately about giving individual's rights\nAnd and instead we're looking at more and more taking away those the people's rights the individual rights of Americans that becomes a real threat but it is not something\nThat is in most people's minds something you respond to with anything else but a vote or a debate\nIt's that simple and that's who we are everyone greens most good people grieve when when there's a loss of life that's who we are as humans that's who we are as a society the the people the very few\nThat have these deranged mines that are that have evil in their hearts\nWe'd like to be able to come up with a solution to try and predict it and try and stop it ahead of time and I I Wish there were way but as a as it stands right now it's just impossible as you mentioned Gary sometimes in a society it is going to happen\nWe can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or stop or prevent the next one we look to learn from it because we all want to stop the loss of life in a situation like this\nWe'll talk more coming up if you'd like to get in line soap an eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nDo for your goals the Sixers on radio [noise]\n\nBe

death\nAre you come to the right place I'm sitting here in the studio at their conduct show talking Scott Shane his book is in good faith questioning religion and\nAtheism okay so Scott you um\nAt some point you decided All right I Want to write a book about this this is a big book and you really get into this this is for people I think we really want to know I've written books\nThat deal with a lot of this kind of stuff I wrote a book on miracles I wrote books called everything always wanted to know about God but were afraid to ask that's more than a popular level this really gets into it and this is not to say that this book is difficult to read it's not\nBut it's it's in depth you've been very rigorous ... answering\nA these questions and when did you decide to do this because this is a real work you've got here\nYes well first of all thank you [noise] the the the the the reason I decided to write a\nA book that was comprehensive yeah was because\nThe new atheist claim that they're you know that they're being scientific right that if you believe in God you're a dummy right or you're still clinging to your parents superstitions or you're gullible or you haven't yet been educated enough so\nI started out and actually writing a little bit simpler book\nBut as I got into it I said I I basically bought I better write a book to can stand up the academic ... criticized right because\nI'd met I have friends who have sent their kids to college who took classes in New took classes in religion came out atheists because they're reading all of these\nUm atheist new ideas freeze for and there was nothing that took them on one by one so I read them yeah and there's exceptions in the book I distilled what their question I was in some cases I actually think I made the atheist question sharper that's why western vote\nWell listen I can say I have not read uh in in in their entirety any of those books you referenced I started to read Christopher Hitchens is God is not good I founded on readable mounted so unpleasant\nAnd the arguments so spurious an ad hominem and sloppy and then I could not believed people were taking this book seriously I mean this is a guy Christopher Hitchens\nWas so brilliant and so funny when you want it to be an entertaining but he kinda carries you along with the sound of his voice or with the way that he writes but the content was garbage was stunning to me that people were taking him seriously I thought he he doesn't have any actual arguments here it's all just kind of potshots\nBasically absolutely I mean are they spend a lot of time mocking religion but one thing that I realized which is a core part of my book is that what the new atheist really conflate is they don't understand the difference between ... and I ... and I try to set up and you've done it in your books to actually try to set up what\nTry and I try to set up and you've done it in your books too actually I Try to set up\nWhat I dollar tree is according to the Bible which is\nA set of lies about power it's describing super authority or super force supernatural powers to remind people write beings or ideologies so we thought we a lot of people think we ... dollar tree thirty eight hundred years ago with the God came pharaoh but\nHow did my order thirty ish million people marched to their death because they believed he had the authority to do so how did Stalin sent tens of millions to the gulag starve a quarter of the Ukraine and no one question it\nI mean that's I dollar tree that's not that's that describing the ... definition in the Bible to a person of course Hitler\nAnd but ... pot\nAnd we see it in modern ways very similarly where people ascribe to themselves\nIn a small way to make themselves idle right\nWell it's interesting you you mentioned a Hitler Pol Pot a Stalin and Mao and those are all totalitarian atheist regimes now some people might quibble with that but I have the facts to say that they're and they're quite wrong I mean Hitler was\nAs far from a Christian as you can be in fact if you were any kind of a serious Christian\nOr he would sent you to a concentration camp or have you killed him and his he was at war with the serious Christians within the third Reich and we're making a movie of the story burn off and that's come to the central issue is that if you were just going along and saying well I'm not a Jew so I guess I'm a Christian you were not a Christian you were a gentile who might go to church\nBut the actual Christians were at war with him and he with them and so you have this line running through these I dollar Chris\nTotalitarian regimes that we're all\nMurderous at their core murderous on a level that we can't even imagine and ironically a religion was not the problem atheism was the problem that was the ideology\nLike ... was the problem I mean religion if you consider a dollar tree of former religion which I don't write by ... tree was a problem is a problem it's a problem today it's a problem everywhere and\nWe ignored at our peril and we continue to ignore it at our peril I can let me give you one we're talking about murderous regimes let me talk to you just mentioned one we're sitting here in New York in a studio\nThere we used to be a former ... there was a former attorney general Eric Schneiderman who was um\nYou know at least they went by the moniker of Jewish but she um set themselves up as the law I mean literally as some of your listeners may know he was deposed because of a whole bunch of a sexual abuse allegations in confirmations\nAnd what he did it he said to his victims I'm the top law enforcement official in New York\nYou can't complain to anybody you have to do what I Want you to do he abused his authority right and it goes back in a small way to ... he made himself the gods and when people do that they abuse other people and it no that's not it they don't necessarily murder or other people but they can cause them\n... and so we have to cleanse I think cleansing the the cleansing our relationships that I dollar tree I think\nIs where it on a microwave just to be clear and what I dollar tree is I mean I'm\nI Would say worshipping or anything other than the loving creator God of the Bible ends up being I dollar tree because\nUh only he is worthy of being worship knows only he created the universe only he\nUh uh ... loves us and lives for us and what you don't know there was anything else that you worship whether the state or yourself a lot of atheists\nAre worshipping themselves even though they might not say it but they are so up put off by worshipping God because that impinges on their uh ability to do whatever they like so they have to say there is no God so they end up worshipping themselves anytime you worship anything other than the actual God of the Bible\nUm ... it becomes adultery doesn't it\nYeah well every person is corrupt double\nAnd um we I think a ... not enough attention is given to the real meaning of the way we choose counted the third commandment most Christians kind of the second commandment\nWhich is not to take God's name and then and then to take out St ... shove in Hebrew and it's the only of the ten commandments by the way for which there is no redemption of repentance and says that right and the commandment\nAnd what does that mean to me it means when people set themselves up ... soul spokespeople for God\nAnd we've seen that in history we see it currently whenever anybody says look believe if you don't ... don't believe in me because I mean believe me because I'm the soul I can give you the sole answer to what God wants you can get in the same sort of trouble which is how\n... the a stick religions get in trouble right people say look just listen to me you don't have to go behind the court don't bother reading the scriptures don't bother reasoning for it right all\nRight that that fast and then of course that was the ... the Luther issue I wrote a biography of Martin Luther and it's so fascinating because you realize it at the heart of it he wasn't really a ... all he was doing really was challenging\nThe authority of the church and the pope and saying look you have to bow\nTo a higher authority just as I Do and if you don't do that you have no legitimate authority and they said oh no no you're wrong or we say goes right we are the ultimate authority where the ultimate arbiter of what God says or didn't say you have no right even the question it and at that moment you realized\nThe goose is cooked when you when you have that when you aggregate yourself that kind of power and authority you take the place of God\nWhich is really creepy yes and deadly you've got and that's what Luther\nTried to do and you do an excellent job of showing of of of demonstrating that is to reclaim the Bible would learn the scriptures on your own see what it says you don't have to take the local priests opinion\nIs it that I mean it's a tricky thing right because you don't want to or you don't want to say that everything is subject that whatever your point of view is is valid no no no when I mean we're not saying that and Luther didn't say that right at the same time\nWe do need to take the responsibility to dig in for ourselves and to be careful not to just listen to somebody because they seem like they're right but the but to understand that they are falling human beings as well\nAnd we can't a ... at the end of the day it's between us in God and it's our responsibility when we come back folks will continue the conversation we're talking with Scott Shay S. H. A. Y. the new book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism stick around\n\n[noise]\nPay out and they can I tell you about really factor plays uh no actually I mean can I tell you about it okay you may I may you may well what I'm trying to say I've got somebody even better Oh yes I've got a guy named Alan who's been using relief factor I'd like to hear what he has to save our lead factor here it is\nA ...

with Scott Shane in the studio the book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism a big book with all kinds of interesting stuff in it\nOr we are talking about miracles so the miracles of the accidents supporting the red sea you say Scott than it has a naturalistic explanation you don't say it's not a miracle but you're saying it's a certain kind of miracle so what do you say happened so\nI I again I think that's an important distinction that God can act to nature got connect outside of nature if he so wishes but in the Bible and the Hebrew scriptures\nThe so called the red sea is called yum soup the regency which sort of changed to read see when it got to the bowl gate and this is why I Love studying and ... because of\nCourse is the Latin version correct of the ... is that when St Jerome translated so we're talking three hundred and eighty a hundred percent correct so that ...\nWas before the ... and had a Greek and that actually in many ways it's it we will would even be a um a corroborate or what I'm about to say OK okay of the translations so they were what I Do on page there three thirty five of my book because I think we have to delve into this where you have to take the\nOne page there three thirty five of my book because I think we have to delve into this way I have to take the criticism seriously well the red sea couldn't apart and well it's actually not the red sea it's there's two lakes that were around at that time right the bottle of lakes and the bitter lakes and if you closely follow\nThe the and I have it on this charge if you closely followed the tracks of the Israel lights including one remember they turn around yeah remember they go for three days and then they turn around and then they end up against some yes some a body of water well it seems like that is um the ... lakes and\nAs late as Napoleon\nThere are discussions sub\nArmies going one direction marching the other way and saying whoa we can't go back to the way there's water why because they're these like do we have there are facts from tidal forces there are read there essentially burying marsh she would never very deep these Barlow in her layers ...\nMarching around Egypt a general\nAnd uh and they encountered this and so you're saying um okay so you're saying there's cooperation so so what are you what are you holding that the that the um [noise] as we've heard that that that a wind blew all night and that it was possible a two part it but it's not as dramatic as it was in for example the ten commandments with Charlton Heston there was nothing like\nThat I Know I mean unfortunately the ten commandments is not actual video footage of the mayor and I know we take it back on\nIts own yeah it can be but I'm sure everybody pressed up against the water praising away to walk maybe it was a little marsh email it was a little ... but I'm sure they viewed it as a miracle narrowed down that\nWay right well see that's what's so interesting is that you know when you talk about what is a miracle a if God's hand was involved in it I mean if you're standing there and there are six million of you and you're about to be killed or whatever by the Egyptian army and suddenly\nHey there's a place to walk where there wasn't a place to walk twenty minutes ago something happened and let's go this way and he was scape and then pharaohs army has drowned in the very place where you to\nMost people would say that as a miracle are now the details of the details and you're you're giving us some more naturalistic explanation I Know a lot of people would disagree with you on all kinds of ah things some would say that the whole thing never happened\nBut it's fascinating I Love this is why I wanted to have you on because\nTalking about this rationally and saying look we first of all we don't have a dog in the fight whatever happened happened we just want to know what is right and a\n... some of the stuff we can know some of the stuff we can speculate on and if we're wrong well eat is what it is you know it's not like it has to be this otherwise my faith crumbles but what you're talking about it's fascinating I I mean I've heard of this before but you you're a you write about an in depth and this book\nAnd I think by taking the tech seriously to and really looking at the words yeah I think there are some things that we take for granted that\nMany believers think that we have to question I think the numbers six hundred thousand Israel a males so I analyze what the word is it's it's ... it's six hundred thousand in in is how it's in is how it's written but when I went back\nAnd spent some time and read a number of a philosopher just review aloof\nAs you may know the Bible or the ...

are put aside and you look at the winds to make sacrifices are much more comports with fifty thousand I ... into it and you're not always going to come out where you want it bites that I Want to come

weeks now well it will be ... it will be two weeks from right now that will be ... analyzing\nA you know everything that that uh has gone on I mean there are ... you get every single day I mean I saw\nYou know that a whole okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles standing well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just everything the pollsters may ... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety four where they weren't even close\nOver the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cover electronics here's your forecast\nIf you're not familiar with the term nor Easter it's what a good portion of the east coast calls a pretty significant storm with wins out of the north and east\nAnd that's what's moving up along the east coast today and steering those wins right into the shores of New York New Jersey and the Delmarva will see heavy rain and the region today from the Carolinas all the way up through well at least Long Island and then back into the Appalachians as far as near Columbus ohio\nA good part of the country though is drive from the Mississippi all the way over to the Rockies will see clear skies today for the northern central and southern plains including Texas\nWhere there have been significant amounts of rainfall and flooding over the past week\nLook for the possibility of some white snow flurries up along the great lakes region mainly near upstate New York as high pressure stairs and cooler Canadian air and moisture from the south collide your national forecast ... radio I'm meteorologist job trout\nThanks so much John eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nA orange and we're not talking the super rich more I learned about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it and what's their only recourse right now\nThere's still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message my Republican congressman mhm and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to then paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote it\nHas the potential of changing five percent of the boat yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nJust the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this is the one thing that may bud perch that is they're coming on bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes\nSo many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax and we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually admitting where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt them we've also talked about the care of it\nRather than we're in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears that along expected decline is here now the economy overall\nMay not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change do small business people that are being affected and\nA caterpillar a worse at the the the caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us write the steel in an automobile the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't the China thing\nRight it's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that there are still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said dare I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] right\nAnd and ah the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's an unbelievable that he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nWas a story last week about Ford grumbling gonna be allusion a billion dollars mhm they believe the terrorists are going to the are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or or feeling it already and every dealership and every moment in the steel tariffs really been affects we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that\nAutomobiles are going to go up in price because of steel costs and now because of tariffs caused and because of the new NAFTA\nAh and\nThen the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about a\nManufacturing people with manufacturing jobs at a technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump\nCountry and you're talking about farmers that are extremely upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our personal meaning you started wonder if that's\nWhy he went to you know even though it was a wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls are saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now as\nA couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt it it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry are you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada ah any nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff war chair of the that went into place\nA or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time a lot of the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar\nA handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nIt's still not making up for what our law says All right and we're ... we're we're a or out of the loop of the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in ... took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us a decade\nNow we don't know when we're going to get back in ... took us deck I think one of the coach was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty is a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks were are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand named to the end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine\nThey there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a possible high risk\nBut they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money in all of the golfers well they've made all the banks look risky\nAnd that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up\nUm you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nThen your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case mhm and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this ... election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are and a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the ... the economy right now for the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the ... you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting this election both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nUh I I think uh\nAnalysis of of the issues affecting this mid term ... eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n... on the

would sell stuff is people like me insanely talented and gifted broadcasters who are coming from their laundry room\nImagine if every time I went on the air I said the sterling on Sunday laundry room

S P e W slime art was [noise]\nThe um uh what was it going to tell you oh the reason the Kmart and Sears and Macy's and all these stores are are in trouble is not because of Amazon Mr ... the reason they're in trouble is because of the apple store\nWhat did the apple store do it showed us how it could be done the apple store revealed to us how it should be you and I go into an apple store what happens ten people surround us and say how can we help you\nAnd then we moved ten feet in another ten people go how can we help you and then when we want to buy they do not give us the opportunity for buyer's remorse they take a a black device off of their belt\nAnd they say credit card cash how do you want to pay for this do you want the receipt emailed to your printed out now whoa\nAnd then the minute we say okay I'm going to buy this they sell it that second because every single person who works at the apple store can closes sale\nWhat happens when you and I go to K. Mart and Sears and Macy's and now you and I are standing in the men's department allude\nWe're surrounded by a load nobody's there and we tried to get our pants fitted were to find out if these are

I'll see if I can get somebody to help you says the person with a name to attack\nBut nobody says I Will help you I Will get these pants fitted for you will make sure they look right for you and I'll get you out of the store right away there's no greater amount of time than the time that\nYou enter a big department store and the time you leave this goes on for ... sits like doctor who you know ... all\nSense of space and time\nThis goes on for ... doctor who you know ... all sense of space and time disappears when you enter Macy's or deal alerts or um\nOr any major department store but fears is worse than it's been worst for years what happens when you go into Sears nothing\nYou walk into is this the main entrance it's never clear in his ears or Kmart is this the main entrance it doesn't look welcoming instead there's random equipment of random furniture in science to the point to nothing\nIt's a horrible not welcoming experience that is why they're in trouble it's not because of Amazon\nIt's because they lost their way they forgot how to merchandise how to please now what happens when you go to Costco when you go to Costco\nAnd you're in line and you realize after you filled up your heart and you're about to buy things that you forgot to milk\nAnd the thought of having to go back to Costco is overwhelming just to get the milk\nThere's a person standing at each cash register they're hoping to bag things you go oh my gosh I forgot my milk and what happens they say oh I'll get your your milk and they have runners they have a runner who goes and gets your milk

I never picked up a golf club once my good me now is not one oh my goodness have not even swung a golf and I got to make that argument coming up yeah the independent Bob got all by the way I was sort of an independent Bob just\nCalled me a few times just ranting I think he knew it was um vacation he just ranting and raving Elizabeth Warren thing just sending them into outer space yeah he's just like this is just\nWell on the they they believe that's a good thing to do\nBut they believe that this is a good tactic would you and I just kind of just in general if you just look at the tactics right now the left as using\nI mean politically we're not talking about the moms in restaurants we're not talking about you know the the the rank and file of the protesters talking about the people holding off it yeah\nTheir political tactics I mean there may this is their mainstream political tactic and they believe\nStuff like this is going to work and and that and you and I made sure that before he went on vacation when we were talking about cabinet not understand this is the mainstream now yeah ours is the\nDemocrat leadership in this country because we'll always get calls from people saying well this is the average Democrat it's the average Democrat now representing you sure in Congress and in the Senate right\nThis is the standard and we'll get to Elizabeth Warren too and uh the the ... big problems that she by the way they want to narrow it down just to three well one of the things I I Love was uh I I never believed in white privilege until Elizabeth Warren\nA white person makes the claim yeah she's Native American you all white privilege that's white privilege fried rice or cultural appropriation\nYeah right I and and again they believe they're on the right track\nI Know it just it's just unbelievable so we'll get to that the polls everything else you've got a great show up for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there's a low pressure systems and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the\nSouthern Sierra is an southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that pretty sick at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued a couple of regional highlights it will be warmer in the west know changing the chances for snow in the Northern Rockies it'll be drier and warmer\nThe great lake region is expected to be drier\nKnow parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter but as a Seventy five percent chance of an El Nino developing which means wetter conditions are possible across the country for winter bears or look at your national forecast from red eye radio meteorologist John throughout\nThank you John eight six six Ninety red eye if you want to join his success [noise] Ninety run I sorry I was busy at the same way I Would be from family yeah [noise]\nAnd we talked about how the protesters lead the party they lead the party they lead the call for the party but how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction and it's it's it's crazy and then\nThen I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter\nQuite right does it does is destroying transgender as if DNA matters because remember the the the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing the ... just starting to embrace ... remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter]\nBefore this one of the leading liberal icons\nSocialist icons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice ... and regulations number one you were saying the DNA matters does it does so DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for uh your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh\nThat writers for your race huh right is is that the is that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter]\n[laughter] where does the decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great stop well and if\nI were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said race is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter] and people forget about that because again what you know it that when a President Obama\n... just before he left office I Believe that was the was the the Atlanta for a New Yorker I forgot what I think it was the Atlantic ... he did a a an interview with\nThey asked him you know why do you say that you're black when you know your ... mixed race soon and he said because I've come to know I come to realize that race is a social construct ... it's what you think you are ... so is that it it now is that done now\nHas the left moved on because when when you look at it there were so many rules\nOf the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent ...\nEverything from cultural appropriation to the fact that race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA that's\nWhy are you using science Warren [laughter] remember when Ben Shapiro brought up science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up science that's wrong but see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions how do you know which one is the row\nHere's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority what Trump says that they criticize in fact check is off the cuff Mm right\nIt's it's an opinion or just a thought that he just boom records out right and and and the insanity of the left\nWhich is I'm going to call them the whole my beer party from now on cars whatever Trump does like ... hold my beer I [laughter] you think that I won't watch what I'm going to say it's actually premeditated and thought out yes no planet today\nThey were trying they're trying to prove them wrong on something that she didn't give a half a second to he didn't give one one hundred and twenty force of a second [laughter] my my favorite was the\n[laughter] water over one hundred and twenty fourth yeah maybe seal and it was a huge I with a gun [laughter] we're in a swimming pool it's you know that that's it it really is the um that's the madness because they believe that something\nThat's going to win\nFor them look in her state in terms of you know her Senate seat yeah she's pretty safe like Dick Durbin he can get away with saying and doing a lot of crazy things he's safe as long as he wants that seat but at least for the time being you want to enter the arena and twenty twenty\nFor the big house well by the way not present the White House I mean yeah but [laughter]\nAlthough although Hillary was a contender for both\nUm [laughter] we ... do you have to get up on that stage and you have to bring down out look again you know those um those blue states where they're safe they can they can do the crazier things they can do to protest or type attitude but do that up on stage you know we talked about this\nWas a few months ago when we were talking about\nWhat the the the pool of contenders in the primary season and twenty twenty will look like right\nThere each going to have the top each other on how much they hate Trump\nThat will be gold number one you've got to show your anger and you've got to show how much you so the person who hates Trump more\nIn terms of the perception by the voter or the rank and file Democrats might get the nomination because that's the goal number one for them so but in order to do that they have to get up on that debate stage during that primary season\nAnd that's what they have to do they have to do the crazier and crazier and crazier because\nNo longer can you have\nA debate\nNo longer can you have a real discussion ... what are they going to say well the economy is suffering Mm as long as it holds between now and twenty twenty no\nA jobs we need more jobs Mm we haven't ... finding enough people right now I'm so the what are you going to do well do you have it has to be about the hatred for Trump's so you're going to have to display you know the one who hates them most is gonna win ...\nWhere it's going that we thought the only way that they could go if they were going to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free yeah yeah and I mean the ... and that we are the other day we yeah we do we we do have a fascist mindset\nI mean ... ... and that we are the other day we we're we do we we do have a fascist mindset and we do we used to control\nA lot a lot of things we do believe in the intimidation\nUh uh uh the tactics out there we don't believe in the constitution of the United states right by the way it's become clear and we brought this up a few years ago and we were amazed\nAt the very little response that we got from Democrats on this ... where we said look they don't really believe in the constitution we now know that they don't they don't believe in the Senate\nThey don't believe in the cars that by the way that gain ground over their vacation and you know the Senate has to go to the electoral college the electoral college just to go to the Senate has to go and what they what they may not realize it but that's when you get into not carrying that belief get you to the point of\nNot caring about individual rights because that's why the Senate exist that's why the electoral college at you know it exists because we're not in direct democracy were republic\nWhere constitutional Republican or a public why to protect individual rights that the Democrats and the ACLU use to care about right but now as we know they don't write and so you know that's where you've got to we really don't believe in America\nAnd so in order to get you to vote for us we'll give you as much free stuff as possible to me that's actually what the Democrats round\nI you're you're spot on and but the problem there is what\nCNN Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo asking tough questions from oh Casio Cortez and Gillum separate interviews okay well how do you pay for it how do you pay for it but but but beyond that forget about the media ask ... wasn't so tough but they did ask the question\nIf you're Hillary and you get back in and twenty twenty\nThe it used to be the boiling the frogs slowly right okay we'll give you a little more free stuff and then we'll a little more free stuff you've got to go for one because you have Gillum and Florida promising to world Casio Cortez promising the world Bernie's been promising the world\nCan all Harris now over the last couple of days yeah you know saying okay let's give everybody right oh let's let's give people six thousand dollars a year that's the starting bright right let's just get cash to people right and and so uh so we're to the the the the free cash free health care and free college and\nYeah and they know they can't pay for it and the American voter knows they can't pay for it but how how do you do it if you're Hillary and you try and put up a plan of\nA little more free stuff no you've got to go full on like the rest of them did\nSomebody will get to the point where we talked about before the twenty sixteen election just offer every American a hundred dollars that exactly or one ticket to the mega millions later this week yet [laughter] eight six six Ninety right I\n[noise] books with literally radio toll free at age ... he wrote a [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling to shovel tell a hotline at eight

free people you don't have a king a team tells people what to do and they have to do it but a free people tells the leaders what to do and the leaders have to do it and they say to him oh you mean like a president he goes yet and if that's what you're looking for um your caveman yeah and so\nThey wouldn't even go to Harlem wicked bullet probably it'd be better for me if you went back and I\nI when I last year had you on this program ah you told me about your\nYour experience at a becoming a Christian it's kind of freaky funny story you you realize it's a funny story no similar going well funny people if people listen to part one would you do hear that because we're not going to rehash nonsense yeah All right I've had enough of that\nBut I'm the only the so you went to ... when you first went to air Bernard's church you versus the first time you saw\nKind of normal people in a church environment you had grown up with a lot of screaming unattractive ...\nScreaming and yelling and jumping like I was seven years old and a church last like six hours on number one time I was in church and there was a dead body in the front\nRight and nobody explained to me is the funeral was not church I'm thinking how to do church like\nThis is normal in a ... or ... what happened to them in in boxing her whole explanation was well he's in a better place and I'm thinking what kind of box even before life like there was no explanation for what you just made no sense and nobody was teaching and nobody was explaining underway to understood is so I'll just stay away from\nInto the story from the show as you should watch will do what kind of a box of skiing before it's funny because you don't know it's funny you just going to know to your reaction you know as you laugh\nAnd I don't laugh which is going to last time life is too short and go to Stuart ... times guys or buses laughter is just a waste ...\nYou're just yellow the horn you do that to you don't even\nKnow ha ha ha first grade and it's on there and just say the age because what what why do you why do you need to save the whole word you know what I'm saying like short here and and now look so you're now you're a professional comedian you've been a fresh in your whole adult life here and what a lot of people don't know his comedy is hard\nTo it's not it's not just like you'd have to invest some jokes like you really think about you got to write all the jokes and you got to memorize them and then you get a goal in front of people and the funniest material\nAnd make sure that actually works because if it doesn't then you'll know it pretty quick because ... county is the only craft that the audience can lie to you about\nMaybe what if you're going to sing you have no way of telling for sure if they loved it in afterwards with her I said to you was gray you're also maybe it could have been miserable because they don't want the acrimony there yeah but in comedy you're on stage\nHe's been joke doesn't work writers no way for the audience to collectively say hey everybody let's make them feel better right by the level of his job together ready go\nCan do I had the the the uh the only time it\nThat is do together ready to go you can\nDo I had the the the uh the only time anything like that has happened to me is uh Larry David who of course created Seinfeld\nWith uh what's his name Seinfeld uh Jerry Lewis and and they ... anyway Larry David did something on Broadway with cold like a fish in the dark or something like that rang\nAnd I knew Larry way back when before he was famous right or right before Seinfeld and like that and and he liked my humor and so we became friends he demeaning the friars club hanging out with her and then we kinda lost touch and\nAnd I um but but you know when he did this thing on Broadway a couple of years of that kind of thought you know I can go backstage and and say hello and I know who to like really freak him out because he knows I'm a Christian and that that you know that freaks certain people out and asked me if I hear\n\nPeople actually yeah and so we I I thought okay middle backstage and I watched the the play which puts a comedy and I hated it so much I could not go backstage\nWow and I know he doesn't listen to this program so free I could tell you that story but I did a show right with ... with a ... George Carlin you know what they what yeah which Carlin George Carlin ... you know before he died afterwards would have been oh yeah so do the show George Carlin and he did\nHe did one Fifteen minutes on why you shouldn't say God Bless like Fifteen minutes just on a subject and I went on after him and I said lady wild George Carlin and God Bless him was hanging out of the biggest laugh to have your editors cry laugh which are\nPutting 'cause that's such a lame joke but they still laugh at you and I think that the real thing Boyd so uh but you're you're right look I mean because I Do a lot of speaking what you just said well when I'm uh sometimes I Will preach sometimes I Will speak but always do funny stuff you have to and that's the only way\nI can know if they're tracking with me up so that has happened at times when I'm Talking\nLike pretty serious ... and I'm not getting anything back like I don't know what's going on and you feel like ... because I'm not getting the laughs\nI feel like the audience is now with meat laughter is the only way you can guarantee you're into that they're tracking absolutely the end or are there but but you're absolutely right if anything else you really have no way of knowing I mean you can't really in play and if it's not a comedy you like did they love it did they hate it I don't know\nYou don't know and then you just got some critics are going to write some bought it like the people that's where I like comedy so much you know media Italy and you'll know immediately if you should probably get another job so I get some uh comedians were asked me questions especially new Comey's they'll say stuff like how can I really make it in comedy and this is my wife\nI said this yesterday on a radio show that was way more fun than this one yeah I'm a ... uh\nI said there's no such thing as a pure stand up comedian there just isn't I mean there's some really really really funny guys with their but only to say to yourself I'm going to be a standup comedian only is actually a ticket to misery\nWhat I mean by that is is comedy is a vehicle it's not a destination\nBut now you know why is that because I'm thinking of people who did comedy ... you know and that was their only thing so what do you mean by that vehicle to what\nWill a vehicle to something greater than just making people laugh because if you think about some of the great some of the great thing comedy think about being in like what it it looked like at\nThe end I don't know about that or did they certainly tried to attach themselves to something bigger by one of the water like a ... of one of the great to know people don't like been sick all in one of the greats anymore was Bill Cosby\nThere is no doubt in the world of comedy you one of the greats right one of the greats go towards the end of his career before all that other stuff jumped off he actually started going through communities are mainly black communities and talking to people about how important it is to make sure you're doing the right things Seventy something years old he has a point where you realize\nLike what did I Do I just made it most people laugh\nLike like people at at a certain point you started to say wait what even greater would actors you say you're so what what are what am I what I really do I'm sure bankers are by all sort of like what did I Do because they have all of this set up and they haven't deliver a real plus my\nFear I I like this idea now I've got to ask you do you uh\nWho who are your influence is growing up when you were a kid you not that much younger than me so when you were a kid I Would have people that you said I Want to do that I find that that that guy's funny or did you did you know as a kid you want to be a comedian what were you thinking as a\nKid when I was three years so uh I used to watch you are listening to you on that just in general yeah that's very funny than to that area and um no my role but it was hard to try to achieve so I thank God I'm younger now ... says ... is that your Walker Britain\nLook now wait a second quarter were practically the same age\nAs you shave your hair off\nNobody can tell if it's gray yeah yeah that's an ... Indian trick and I'm not going for it and here's your come on your influence is growing up poor they let me just finish this little comment was in fact you know because you just put your hair on your way to fix I Know I'm very open with my audience\nThis is a this is a a a wealth fitted horse hair wig had commissioned from a weak master I said\nI said money's no object I don't want the finest wig money can buy and he said well that's going to be horse here because of course here hold that value is from turkey derby too and I got to meet the ... and it was a very intelligent horse and I said\nI Want that on my head so they kill the horse and a lot of behind it but they said that uh Eric they said this is going to it's expensive but it's going to hold its value if you want to resell that wing someday gravity get\nMost of the money that you pay for it so that's what you're looking at right now we're\nProbably nine seconds press the joke was or ... you should have jumped in and say hey let's start in ...\nSo what do you what do you know about jokes and this was going to try to ask you who were your influences\nSo here's what gets really weird about this question in and among go ahead and answer so is this is this is where people don't understand so when I first started to accommodate it was the strangest thing I'm doing comedy and I completely lost my taste for watching comedy like

I live in California there's ... there's no hope actually here in New York City it's just\nI Love your son surrounded by left he's just like you are on Libya\nWere so yeah I don't know but you may be worse but I yesterday I got more optimism in terms of the house 'cause a lot of people felt like you did that we could win the house but\nYou were the rejoined yours I mentioned his race cars I Know him pretty well Dana Rohrabacher who's been there Twenty years and in orange county which used to be the bastion of conservatism in in California it's not anymore and they're pouring in so much money and the other side that\nI Know people know him much better than I Do or close to him and he he's worried so the houses you know their individual races their individual elections across the country\nAnd you're right the experts say that the Republican side is going to lose the house and they may not be the blue wave they're talking about but I'm concerned but cautiously optimistic and maybe you'll be very tight and will sue when the house you definitely right when you're\nNot telling you first of all people are are absolutely nuts about Trump as I Am white people said about George W W like this on these a murderer alert orange alert or he\nDidn't respond we're all going crazy and it's a bad damage and the Republicans finally also caught on all of a sudden I understand yesterday McConnell and got a standing ovation\nThe head of the Senate yeah nobody really liked them because they don't fight back they were afraid to be weird they don't defend that other guy Republican get smeared because they're afraid they're going to be next\nTo Republicans up in the same page Democrats have the same talking points they all say the exact same thing one after the other together with the media but Trump fights back he doesn't like the Senate either it doesn't give a damn about political correctness you said earlier you have to be careful you can be careful\nWhat culture yesterday isn't so strict today whatever you say that they're really sick like Michael Savage always says you know it's a mental disease so they're literally to ask a five year old girl if you're a boy or girl\nI it's like it I I don't know if I'm living in the country it's like the Democrats are normal people ... J. F. K.

[laughter] you know I I Know and and what I liked cars natural habitat which it here and talk and try live\nAt mar a Lago ... and I know in the White House and I told him I you know in campaign mode and and so and I know it's ... and and I wanted to comment on his sanity using\nMy background may catch genes and human organizational development and I had you know as I looked at people within the contracts that they shouldn't than a contract that human development in the context of their education their family birth order\nAnd and and\nI see this president as perfectly suited for that China and I I made it there Sean Sean Hannity show and I stand by it can be quite possibly be the most person to ever occupied oval\nOffice that no no no go ahead go ahead yeah\nWell I said I think it's like my actual reality is that if people would stop and consider they could stop worrying about whether or not he's crazy she's not trade he is just very well suited for such a tribe that says go ahead it's\nFunny you say that honestly because the the reason I think he resonates with so many people no matter what you think of all the details and whatever and he's not perfect let's face it he does things that I don't like what\nHe has a really\nRemarkable a virtuoso level\nOf common sense it's it's really something\nThat is remarkable I mean when I saw him on Lesley Stahl talking sixty minutes the other day I thought to myself what is so funny is that somebody that I Love like Ronald Reagan I Would never imagine him going toe to toe with hospital journalist like Lesley Stahl he just wouldn't put himself in that position\nTrump wave in there and he goes toe to toe and most of what he says I mean they try to get a B soundbites and things but\nI I listened to my thought to myself this man\nHas been given a gift of buried deep commonsense to kind of rare\nIn life and when you see somebody has they usually are really good businessman entrepreneurs or something and of course he is that but to see him functioning in the way that he is right now it's it's it's it's come to my mind fascinating because there are plenty people you know this pundits are in the media world\nBut one thing they do not have\nIs common sense they may be brilliant they may have a lot of degrees but they don't have common sense and so it's kind of funny to see this guy with his commonsense on full display\nA constantly but it's just interesting to me that that you comment on that because you're in a position where the beach the psychology to talk about that into to assess it right\nTo marry you make\nPersonality tied have actually my back the\nPersonality type or just to see what the Briggs type indicator in my opinion it gets claimed here I Am not ever like logical analysis on him although I'm going to ask him for that on the next train him but I Am I but I just in an talk once you've done a lot of\nThat sort of has managed to take all\nYou know on the on the outside and that is the okay with my book and I know is it because he didn't treat about it but you know if you look at his family birth order this is where it gets really interesting and I won't go choo choo deep on average weeds but it it is fascinating\nAnd interesting burnt daughter um called eight eight first and last that double birth order and and he happened\nTo have the ... next sibling at the end it right heart is birth order to have both character traits other first born baby\n... baby we all know have ... children we all know the baby of the family of five just like he had five children like I by soldiers made it really easy for me to try to take a look at that age\nMaybe at any family that confident thinks everyone wants them to understand why anyone wouldn't loved them kind of curious tied but a lot of times with that personality type he also maybe a little bit of a diminished the responsibility to add a lot of big sibling to do everything for them sad\nSad if there's a large space between them and they're older sibling and that older sibling and younger so there are a younger sibling as well that they get to buy that makes sense\nThat it never ... birth\nOrder so they become a natural leader with his great Gary as close to the edge and energy and and total optimism that they just think they can pretty much do anything and usually they can't because they were born that the leadership qualities because they have a younger sibling it at all but it's possible for\nSo it's an amazing preparation for an allergy type on top of that in this business document and all the other hand if you already know about making very uniquely qualified for it but you're trying to get you know Eric I wouldn't that make you you mentioned Ronald\nReagan in ... he was always my favorite president prior to that but I don't think we need to compare president\nBut you and I and the rest of the conservative movement course meaning for disruptor to come in and do wake up the cartel that I'd become our party that was way too much for consultants and way too much deference to the media and all the rest of it right and this president\nYou need to do this I don't know that as you mentioned that Ronald Reagan\nCould have done what the president doing right now and the needed this president right now\nThat there's no doubt about that I find it for some reason I find the whole thing hilarious when I say all areas when I really mean\nSo delightful but I have to break out in laughter there's something comedic and entertaining about him because he will say what everyone is thinking and that's what you're not supposed to do Reagan did it really didn't do it on the level that Trump does but ... when Reagan said\nMr Gorbachev tear down this wall fry\nEverybody told him I think there were seven draft and they cut it out of every draft they basically said look you don't understand you're not that breaks the way we do things around here you do not say this and he said well I Am going to say it why am I going to say it's\nBecause deep in my heart I Know this is true and this is right and I understand where you're coming from but I think you're wrong and I'm the president and um the leader I'm not getting paid to listen to you I'm getting paid ultimately to lead to make my decision this president does that every day it's kind of like he doesn't know how not to do it and so\nNow that it hit a ball and I and and this doesn't mean that he gets it right every single time I mean I have to say I am angry that he said horse face in his tweet I I Want to smack him and say hey you are so presidential you don't need to stoop to that level but other than that\nOnce in a blue moon you'll do something like that he is saying things on a level every single day

seeing some really interesting things it's funny because\nYou genuinely have a a PHD in psychology so if we're going to talk about the the mental health of this president if anybody a is a in a position to talk about it you would be you were just talking about how uh the book by a it was is it Bob Woodward it was Bob Woodward\nOh of course who doesn't get him and Bernstein confused um but I have to say it it is kind of funny that uh\nHe and so many others are planning on this it's a funny thing I happen to know and you know this from my bone offer book which I Believe is on your coffee table then you know one of the ways they were trying to get rid of a Hitler who was genuinely evil\nYou know one of the ways they were trying to get rid of a Hitler who was genuinely evil was they were going to have him assessed\nBy the most famous like high tourist in all of Germany who was the father of Dietrich Bonham for Dr Carl bone offer and it's interesting thing is that they were actually going to try to assess him with you know the greatest psychiatry just\nLike you know in all of Germany now it's interesting because people confuse evil with insanity you could be perfectly sane and be evil or you could be perfectly insane and good you know but it's kinda funny people today like Bernstein and others they sort of think like look if I don't like him\nAnd if he's doing things I don't like he must be insane I mean it's kind of odd isn't it that that people really don't understand what sanity is they just think if you don't agree with me you must be insane is kind of a scary thought\nWell I think people conflate narcissism and mental illness I don't personally believe that I Believe first of all that knocks it says ... now this is my own theory and on and it can be completely clear because I've been attacked\nIn but the ones I called the book and you can imagine even pulled my weaning down on Amazon and everything um for my work\nI'm In it so to be perfectly might teach taken in organizational development I Want to say that because they attacked me because they said it's not in college he specifically well it's a ... at a psychology but whatever I I think I think is an effect on January ... know airing in research or anything else and I believe that most people\nIn show business most people I think we need and talk radio right they do get television shows like I Do every day on Newsmax TV um I think most people\n\nIt's a war hearing how much you know it's it is I think that they're selfish maniac they're going to kill somebody but I'm saying if you're going to run for public office especially that state level or higher certainly for president at the United states I think you would have a difficult case proving that you weren't and not just that\nSome some level rise spectrum\nRight and I and I put myself in that category as well about it but that doesn't make you change and it doesn't make you eat all and\nIt doesn't make you devious now are all evil people are probably\nThat's a different place on the spectrum of very very different kind of nuts it's it's a lego maniacal kind of noxious isn't that a dangerous right and I believe you have to have other mental efficiencies as well but people get really confused about\nPsychology being a science and it's really not Eric it's really a theory there's nothing you know it's not a scientific is global warming and\nI don't think that the scientific either and so you're right people\nHave to be ... yeah so I think one of the really important things to do here cleaning it and make with you on the state for we go any further and that is they started with the Trump pressure thing to try to destroy him because they don't like his ideas they went to the women thing they tried to destroy and with that now start of this paying his legal fees who knew that could happen\nYou know there's going to continue that I Believe their final effort is going to be to try to declare the president mentally incompetent insane or or perhaps with some sort of the generic mental condition that we have to be ready to fight back\nFor our values and the things that we've accomplished ... that set than working for for decades\nWell you're you're right and I also think that when we haven't mentioned speaking as a creative I think creativity\nOr in madness and I use madness in quotes but there's a relationship there knows if you're thinking out of the box and you think differently than others do people always want to call you crazy or you know burn her she's a witch because she thinks differently and I think that this\nPresident without any question is wildly creative his brain is churning in ways that\nA lot of people and again doesn't mean you have to agree with him but you have to give him credit that he's thinking outside the box and he's extremely creative he'll do things that you you know you you would\nYou could do to take classes on how to be president for a hundred years and they will never tell you to do what he's done with Kim Jong own or others he really is doing some things where\nI can imagine people say like oh I don't know that seems pretty weird to me

and I look forward to the next Tuesday and Jerry and ours is actually the Sunday night Monday morning and\nI could easily get use to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious to me and you're kind comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the Marcus for show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next beyond October twenty ninth on another show but ... again check that out of my Web page number of topics I said I Would get to die so I Want to keep my word for someone to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now in the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on but I've never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on first a segment at least and see your response\nThe issues really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens out of college last night said you know markets legal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss puts them somewhere or and lost them\nBecause if you acknowledge their come here illegally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here\nReally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here and the story and and another caller said that why you know why is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo it was an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walks into your say your bank and wants to take the money out of your account or right they were to be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was there a cap and they just didn't have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access isn't that obvious\nWhich is why it is so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this they can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left as one of the argument over language\nSo I'll give you some examples undocumented in this case over legal\nLivable wage and and minimum wage right we we live with yours for minimum wage here's the wages that the government by the way the term that people should be paid which is\nRidiculous on his face and a free market economy in a capitalist economy as a government you know what the right wages for you and your business they're certainly not there when your business fails\nBut they're going to tell you how much you should have to pay your workers but of course people don't quite hear this argument and I could go on it's much more expensive than that\nHow about global warming or climate change right so they started if you're a member with global warming\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney actually had a right to use the wrong language stuffed up whenever we go again would language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I wouldn't say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no benefits I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be staying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and the shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Ellis Island they were so happy to have a blended\nAt the

again take your calls and eight six six Ninety red eye and we're talking about illegal immigration\nAnd let's see with Fred in Washington DC has to say about it for it [noise]\n[noise] well I don't have a\nLanguage that you talk about one of the biggest glaring saying that that you even do it yourself and I used to do it but I'll marry you say American would actually we are us citizens in America and\nThe liberals are not a liberal that's called radical they actually taken that word applied it to everyone on the side of this so when they when they walk in American you know we think\nThat it's just sitting here thinking the other side of the world and immigration means nothing to them I mean this is just normal stuff St grain wars when we say Americans and they they say American say brainwash us\nTo think that we're saying citizens and they and they think they're brainwashed us to think that\nEverybody uses American book when you look at your passport if you have one that says US citizen that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate what what state are words have got to be deliberate and that's that's got to be all the main thing that we have to do even on the air because the radicals or taking those words and\nThat's what I said\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to them I just refused to do it\nI eat when I hear that word America or Americans in me you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them usurp that and just because they think Americans you know north Americans whatever they want to use it for not going to let them get away with that\nOh and you know some of the songs right America the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that\nAgain I don't want to concede the language them at all that's why it's important and legal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people kept me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to him and and if you do that and then you're kind of giving up a little bit now where Americans we passed for United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America when the United states of America America usa whatever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call but that's my take on it and now you're a national forecast for cobra electrons\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with a system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on I. eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies\nRain for Texas continues today\nWe're looking at close to two months worth of rain forest some parts of central Texas snow in the southern Rocky's\nA little too warm for snow in Denver we overnight low thirty four high later today at fifty nine\nIt's winter weather preparedness week in Colorado a reminder that winter weather can arrive quickly and oftentimes without warning and the high country and there is today is looked at your national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\n[noise] and I'm more Chrysler and I want to know you're taking a legal immigration at eight six six Ninety [noise]\nKnow and as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico right to send us send us the poor and is not our problem right and there's your problem\nAnd then you can also add onto that we're going to stop the stuff you know\nAnd I know there's nothing like the right and center and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is terrific you you you know I I Would come here to that's why I said\nThe insurance interest and we can make money interest you know what\nYeah you should have given this idea to President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou better than I Do [laughter] I don't think [laughter] that's a\nGreat call things Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education and bought a person I send them to then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's a head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know what\nA ... it's tough and and that's one of the new stories that the I think they were heading someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're a conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it it's tough it's tough and a lot of your point that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president and I'd say if you could say well to New York trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days if they get in power not only hearings and subpoenas but do you know they're going to go after taxes\nBecause they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of deal the Russians but even if they don't what business is it um there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done I I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know what I Do I pay what I'm supposed to pay and do my share but it's not anybody else's business by the way after the Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff as they go after his taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why do people want to serve ... especially people that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those said hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they are much more likely to say I want to go back to my family into my life because they don't believe in this the whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things he's limited government that government stays out of your lives and says don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I've given both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights your going to have an energy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible\nThat's why some people question is\nWhy I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that it shows this debate in perspective with the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think ... mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people will have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were had the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they do this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that\nAnd there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that we have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant\nSo there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of\nAnd the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose but even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this is the house has to pass the Senate has to concur and and the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it\nAnd then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional they really were afraid of big government\nSo that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut most you guys do and even if you're on the less I Want you to explain to me why I'm wrong about illegal immigration gave me a call at eight six six Ninety red eye\nMeanwhile I'm wrong about illegal immigration gimme call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven
