promised an end to austerity after eight years of Eunice is here from our business desk and begin are we expecting to be spending budget for Britain them well as you say shine that\nSarah T after eight years of newness is here from our business asking Vivian are we expecting a big spending budget for Britain them\nWell as you say ... or the conservative party conference last month declared to much fanfare that austerity is that after eight years of cuts in public spending or they were phrases in public sector wages and sweeping cuts to sums up as the services particularly at a local government level\nBut the prime minister said that thanks to all of that belt tightening that will be better days ahead this afternoon in parliament all eyes will be on finance minister Philip Hammond he's known as the chancellor to see if he can deliver on that problem is how I miss him from the Institute the fiscal studies here in London says it won't be easy\nThe chancellor like to go to a very difficult to Oscar three somebody wants him to ... um but he also has a commitment to try and eliminate the budget deficit I'm so used to have normal government boring from about the mid twenties ...\nOn the situation is in is in the last financial ... boring was around forty billion pounds\nOn certain focus to come down over the next few years but because of cuts spending so on the one hand you want to not be causing spending because we want to indulge territory but on the other hand he needs to the deficit to come down and to eventually be eliminated to me seems to have a commitment to get it for legal\n... juggling act for finance minister Philip Hammond among the spending announcements we are expecting a more money the public services particularly mental health services as well as some money for infrastructure spending and that's in an attempt to boost Britain's productivity\nI mean it's an optimistic headline but aren't Britain's finance is really dependent on Brexit and the deal it gets when it leaves you\nYes I miss the Hammond is expected to tell him pays today that the really big decisions on public spending can only be made wants to break the deal has been done and Britain's feature trade arrangement with the European Union has become clear as calling us and said we really don't know what that will look like just yet\nThe ... the deal has been done in Britain's feature trade arrangement with the European Union has become clear as kind of innocence that we really don't know what that will look like just yet\nThe government's focus so far been predicated on a kind of or at least move breaks it it's certainly the case if we have a very disruptive breaks it was like for example there's no deal made with the European Union and we just read the to trade on WTO terms that would be hugely damaging in the short run\nAnd then we clearly affect grocery significantly my costs will solve effect tax revenues to the Johnson's goldie ... head of this\nWild public finance focus was on ... and then it's difficult to know how to do tax policy and spending policy in that kind of environment actually at the moment we have even more uncertainty than usual\nKind of ... to cheat the fiscal study there's many folks [noise]\n\nHe's down I mean she was seven twenty four minutes past the hour we can go now to Germany and a key regional election and the western states

the government could governing coalition\nSixty percent of voters said that they use these regional elections just send a signal to the national level that either they get out get out of governing governing better at the national level and to as you said\nThis needs to a lot of question marks about this is the inability of the coalition has also Mrs Merkel the political future\nWould listen to this is a regional national issue so regional issues would really like to hear it was most things like questions of migration questions of governance from the center\n[noise] it wasn't even any sort of question like migration that was the dominant there's more to the state of the governing coalition that the had kind of self inflicted crisis throughout the summer\nThat where they were triggered by some of the conditional part doesn't specially Mrs Merkel partner's problems but very out of the Christian social union and voters were unhappy with the state in which the coalition presented itself and they said\nYou know we want to send us take well and they actually made the party's stronger that either presented the far right alternative alternative for Germany or the Green Party which cause then is a centrist moderate open minded alternative and in general\nIt also I think all the end or the minds of what we call big tent party a catch all parties the Christian Iraq has the Social Democrats Germany thing is party landscape is becoming a more fragmented that make the poor man governing coalition it's more complicated\nTo say the demise of ... he's going to a big statement isn't it because that combination okay struggling but he still miss his medical he's still they're\nStill there but ah ... ah we went to the polls now all day wasn't get and we used to call the\nStill they're\nStill there but a ... ah we went to the polls now all day wasn't gets and we used to call this radicalization because it it had an overpowering majorities\nSeventy percent eighty percent of the votes right now if you believe the polls the Christian Democrats and the social network of these big tent party is combined with barely get forty percent off the boat so there you have the demise of that all the way\nIt's not clear whether that terminal or there's just a loss of faith because they've been governing are seen as governing\nSo put it together but the people seem to be clearly more cosy in smaller towns and that makes the Christian Democrats that makes the Green Party is stronger that also made and also a chief the generational shift they have new fresh ... the leaders and of course the far right alternative for Germany\nThen entered into the sixteenth fine you know they they made a complete run and they're all represent all regional government the regional state assembly\nIn Germany now the the latest results coupled with the ... back in the area not long ago will just mean Mrs ... who has no money to the gym and politics are so no\nThis is the endgame of Mrs mark on now the question is how long it a little less but that low last fall for three years that we still have long or the left in the journal whether whether it will happen\nRight now it looks that she may have to give up the party chairmanship December of what the party comes together\nAnd she wanted to be reelected as chairperson but right now there's a lot of voices against that and there's a big question on all the Social Democrats will position themselves but they are really suffering they didn't want to go into this coalition they were forced to go into this coalition because all other all the global alternative\nThey are really suffering they didn't want to go into this whole issue they were forced to go into this coalition because all other all its little alternatives to work all the suffering at the polls ever served as a real kind of patient\nWas in a strong sexual or credit card to jump out of the window\nAnd leave this coalition so what do they ask for Europe and the rest of the world is that Germany will be a lot in the evening with internal politics the in the in the ... the added to this but at a game of those folks ran it may be a fairly drawn out affair\nTo

it's good for the people that live in democratic society so I think it's an ominous development when you get threats to democracy well\nVery many people in your native United States like the fact that democracy helped elect President Trump and I think that he's finding that corner\nWell actually what we're talking about his liberal democracy so the democracy park refers to people voting but the liberal part refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances to make sure that what the people choose doesn't ...\nTo the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances that make sure that\nWhat the people choose doesn't Sharon eyes over their fellow citizens doesn't excessively concentrate power and that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of the populace politician like Donald Trump\nI'll hang on democracy is only a good thing when people vote in a way that you did prove off\nNo I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law you know people can make lots of choices but their choices cannot uh include for example the\nDepriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us what\nLinked D.C between demanding dignity an identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have that we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized and that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that\nDignity we want the society to acknowledge that we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender ethnicity than race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years you recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't you know so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nAh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution\nFought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect it's something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of the national community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know when I\nWas born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nNow that will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like victim oil banning hungry who you mentioned in your book\nAnd like the alternatives that Germany movement that you will send mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat a ... view you know what a liberal Californian view your day mate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and got all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live and de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to\nHave a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people or you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\n... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are used to her\nPatients are collectively ... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say you're you know not California and that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIs a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that democracy is black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt uh is Fox or see an action or and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um the Justice Department and I think that if she\nGets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts and the independence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity they demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black\nIt's really interesting isn't it because it's the talk of bites democracy and I think it's in some ways a merchandise democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes\nAnd I think it's in some ways a merchandise to democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes\nBut what we've got in the middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other in the same in the same so descendents\nSo identity politics is really saw shifting sons\nIn terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either end of this extreme and people gravitate towards the middle where we find unhappiness with it\nAnd therefore won't say effectively how the freedom to go back to the extremes\nWhich then become uncomfortable and we moved to the middle so that ... that comes from Brian in motion effectively in politics is really interesting do you have\nBeliefs F cell based on your identity\nI'm not sure I Do a show my identity is a it's a multi faceted and so my political beliefs\nBut I think this issue here is is really I'm very profound and I think France is so ... started the debate which I Hope will be grab by people more widely\nOne of the assumptions as being that I'm the end of history that doesn't western liberal democracy is the way forward we are not going to do any ... ... ... it's not going to go away we'll even though it's so new ... indeed and history history tells us anything everything has a sell by date\nAnd if it is if we do think it's the best system than we need to

but true\nBy one estimate there have been airstrikes carried out by the Saudi led coalition in Yemen every Ninety minutes since then on the impact has been absolutely devastating in terms of the loss

environment correspondent not McGraw the\nWith these techniques that they talked about here is that nobody's retry them yet because there's no real financial incentive to do them but on the basis of the calculations of these scientists and others have done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices the brothers would be boring things more sorry fly

got these machines that looked like washing machines that fans in the ... of the year\nThey can do that right now they cost about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they remove but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a ton if they do that\nThat's a very successful and we could beat this problem\nThe big problem with that is this what they philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove comments that Mr why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers that politicians and campaigners environmental is really worry about because if people think there's gonna be a solution ten years down the track they'll keep flying they'll keep eating meat to keep driving cars they do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo the extent is common capture happening all ready and how can you make it more appealing\nOther lots of different things going on with the moments every country in the world is planting trees pretty much people are trying to change the way that they do for a station that the\n... lengthen the time to time the trees grow or they changed you know when they have a massive kilometer you fire or something they plan very quickly the bigger more technical industrial challenge of you know holding on big pieces of technology to coal fired stations\nThey're all they're in theory but very few in practice is really a handful around the world and the big problem with that because all these big bits of case cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hand in the park has to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report that's come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands near the sea if you can protect those there may zing source of our thing for common they soak up more carbon than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton of carbon and that is really really cheap the bigger problem of course a lot of times we don't have enough of them you know the fight the number of ...\nYou can do it for about twenty dollars a ton of carbon and that is really really cheap the bigger problem course long terms we don't have enough of them you know the fight the number of coastal areas in the world is fine nice people want to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the gains are making so\nThe big tech not really happening a lot of smaller take is happening and it's cheap and I'll just report things we do more but how do you\nIncentivize countries such as China countries such as India which have been industrialized in very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was doing carbon capture\nYeah both China and India are taking all these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that are also obviously building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief amongst richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon and sequester it\nThen there'll be able to either share that technology but Indian China nothing really happened so far and there are number of intellectual property questions about all that the big challenges but China and India they remain on solved at this point\nNot Accra that's it from the well this week for now don't forget to join us at the same time next week for ... ... what's happened in the next seven days

the technology industry to be accused of playing fast and loose with user privacy collecting data on a scale and needing to be reined in buying you lose what is stopping however is when that comes from the leader of the world's most valuable technology company\nSpeaking at the international conference of data protection and prevent the commission is in Brussels this week Apple's Tim Cook painted a dystopian picture of his industry and code for the United states to bring in something similar to Europe's GDP oh a tough data privacy law here some of what he said\nOur own information from

to Chinese iPhone users who have bought from student a virtual private network to get round censorship\nWhat ten Fifteen twenty calls could pop overnight and charge that would be one type of solution the other type of solution we need\nIs we need rapid charging infrastructure in the areas where those people are traveling now the the reason I think why the u._k. charging infrastructure is not as well developed as in other countries is because it's a little bit of a catch twenty two there's a catch twenty two where the people who are responsible for ruining out in the charging infrastructure\nDon't have the incentive unless they have clear line of sight into a launch vehicle base of electric vehicles who they know that kind of service and also there's a catch twenty two because people won't buy electric vehicles and unless they know the charging infrastructure in place\nSo that's why we think the clean Power Plan which is the two hundred million pounds of investment is a very good way of trying to unlock that catch twenty two\nThat's Jeremy Heywood a ... a ... a special guest that you just been telling me that you used to be a motoring genocide your perfect for

News Brazil told me about this investigation and explained to just how important what type has become in Brazil\nWhat's up is very important the company says a hundred and twenty million people use watts up in Brazil and the population is two hundred and ten million\nIt has become and Brazil almost like a social media and not only an instant messaging app where people participate in groups with people they don't know from around Brazil and chat with them\nOne hypothesis is that this happens because of how ... networks offer what's up for free without discounting the Internet data so\nIt's it's a cheap and readily available to and how is it being abused during the present you know actions\nSo we found out that there are ... that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook\nAnd then use these numbers to a target them with lots of messages they can put people in in lots of groups and they can to send the message is individually about a candidate\nOr when they put people in lots of groups one markets here who I spoke to was told me he would put a a person and a group\nAnd the group would have a name that is not related to candidates specifically like political debate and then people would start talking but there were would be to ah people infiltrated from the campaign that will try to lead these people on and make them support the candidate and this is just\nA little fringe activity or is it an awful lot of this happening\nWhile we can say for sure how many people\nSupport the candidate and this is just a little fringe activity or is it an overload of this happening while we can't say for sure how many people are using this but in our report we saw that this has has been used by different candidates in Brazil and different parties lots of different parties\nAnd it was top has played a big part in this campaign in Brazil are very big part uh so we have sixty six percent of the voters saying that they have used watts up they use watts up in Brazil\nAnd ah the far right candidate presidential candidate staples for NATO\nOr who's come pain is is being played a lot uh in in what is this against Facebook's rooms in any way well it is against Facebook's rules Facebook said and Facebook told us it is investigating a the claims\nAre it is also against a lots of rules and watts of has been a trying to\nShut down spam accounts what they say they said that they have closed thousands of Spanish accounts in Brazil\nAnd the justice system in Brazil or doesn't let it clear if it's a against the law or not it hasn't a written laws thinking about what's up this year until specialist in the electoral justice in Brazil\nOr disagree between what is it legal and what is not they can only say that illegal database is being used to

the impact of social media on elections with the U.S presidential elections um and it keeps on going on in its own was Facebook isn't it Facebook's role in this because of course it works I just keep\n... um and it keeps on going on in its own was Facebook isn't it Facebook's role in this because of course the world's up just keeps on ... ringing alone bells and they don't seem to be able to do much about it\nWell some of us will be morning about is coming from over two years actually but it got fashionable two years ago for various reasons yes I I think it is you know it was ... at the same problem which is how our politicians today going to get their message across to people on campaign\nThe way the wheels socially interact now he's completely tied up with social media so obviously the politicians are going to do that and then you get these questions of well why did they get the data how were they targeting paper the messages\nAre I think things have ... but he is having conversations if you were a political candidate he would also trying to do that now in this particular case face but it does seem to be the ... Leakey with people's time numbers\nOr to put it kindly so the these are all the questions if I was suddenly being added to groups gang well who is this and why am I being added to this I think I'd be annoyed\nBut I think there's always a danger of confusing the specifics of how ... put across with what the message is all me if you if you think that the way that campaign to being conducted in terms of the content is a problem I think that's why you need to focus\nOn we've seen more ovens this week the vice was not ... will for instance in sight news being used as a political weapon in the United states more examples ... a whole saga or about the caravan of migrants\nBut it's a kind of impossible find any for social media because that whole model is\nEverybody shares it everybody else we don't control the content and so if that she'll sets up whose job is it going to be to say well this is acceptable and this is not acceptable and and I think is a real problem is an easy answer that you can say that should be government regulation\nIt can't be to say well this is acceptable and this is not acceptable and and I think is a real problem it it was an easy answer you can say this should be government regulation and then you effectively have\nState censorship of what's acceptable and what isn't or if you get the companies themselves to police it well then you've got private companies in Silicon valley deciding what we can read and what we can't wait so it is a problem I didn't want answers [noise]\nWell we're going to leave you without announcing that it's a story we've covered the many times on tax and then when we come back to thanks to my special guest amend ... thanks to my baby see technology colleague climate and you can read older that story's a BBC adult ... technology to video losses stories\nPlenty plenty of information that and I've got to join his again in the tech tent\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

moments and what happened to him inside the Saudi consulate in this temple I think this is going to be a pivotal moment for the Trump Administration it has to make a very hard call what to do about an ally that has been pivotal in three of a\nPresident Trump's five most important foreign policy goals\nAnd those are well the first one is obviously this elusive Arab Israeli peace plan that President Trump originally said was not going to be as difficult as everyone thought and it has been repeatedly delayed it was scheduled to be rolled out this fall or the second\nIs the Iran and squeezing Iran

for example I wake up in the morning and you were a well I have electricity\nUm these days it's very cold we cannot have teachers hospitals cannot create because\nThe shortage of you is and then when

week federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described effort by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter budge to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including issues raised in sports\nTo to use Twitter budge to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew bitten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem to beat and joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at\nWe're sowing discord this issue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen President Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more\n... that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\n... so it it it wasn't directed achieving a certain result just to just er things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is fraught\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then\nSuch as a month ago we saw the new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in Andrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nTwenty years

that we have a particular role or handling all that stuff\nThat's your job and we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff and focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more\nThere is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that all I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate

taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to be sense [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared to host president say that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions they're inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case it but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah um how could you not and I miss Carl Kasell\nWe all you've had some great partners I have and I've been blessed and I have stood on the shoulders are next to the shoulders\nOf giants as everyone knows a not only was Carl Kasell original judge and scorekeeper he was our presiding spirit and he still is even though he's no longer with us\nAnd bill Curtis has a voice that's on loan from the heavens and he also much like Carl\nHas a really interesting sense of humor gosh yes yes and he runs a little shall we say salacious I Believe is the public radio word will use and every now and then our audience gets a glimpse of that but my favorite thing is when off air he'll let loose with the profanity and\nGets a glimpse of that but my

about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\nWhat being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nWell I think she's a very good case to think about because you ask what's the relationship between self ... and and

the moments when identities leads to to hostility and hatred and division\nThat's the thing that one's looking for for that I think some things can be said or but these are just things that are known

flying time all the same some of those involved in driving the new tech like engineering ... top ... go era uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power that runs\nWorking on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now and then use the hybrids system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be\nAnd what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and an upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game it's really a combination of the major multi billion dollar aerospace companies and

new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they develop the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you\nAcross New York or London or Paris\nIf you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now\nWhat I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power trains like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery\nCraft let's

and the diversity of aircraft types than grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably in the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think the most traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been all of a sudden they have perhaps low regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of

point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere\nIt's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic how soon\nAre we going to see this revolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and ... by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus in less like a taxi\nOr going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from

in lobbying Steve tape it says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job in galvanizing industry employing everybody together to go after a common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is well it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but brilliant but realistic\nOr you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big cities to land I guess but is this going to start in Europe and America what was going to start somewhere else about the regulatory hurdles to this high\nYeah I think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and uh it just a natural fit\nYou know a lot of islands to jump over ... less dangerous for that reason because I mean you're not going to crash onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight over the water most of the time\nJust safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big busy cities to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and

there's an application for this type of transportation\nTheloop says it's hyping to pilot flying taxis and a number of western cities Los Angeles Dallas New York or Paris as soon as twenty twenty five but it is that actually unrealistic sheds you'll give them the technical and psychological obstacles we're gonna have to overcome a professor Steve right from the University of the west of England well is this the worry\nFirst time we have an accident which can be attributed to machine as you can imagine people kind of lose their mind to it\nAnd say we're getting very very carefully because one

to diagnose a disease and responses appropriately that was the school of economics that actually did that was how to handle the crisis was old fashioned getting in economics\nAnd a number of people made that point the van people recommended fiscal stimulus in the face off a deep recession they weren't using frontier economics with the guy that gets don't graduate schools\nThey were using stuff that if they do remember it from the undergraduate days yeah so do you get onto the surgeries did rather better than the economics of the eighties and nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis I like to the extent to which was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in close what we're seeing on the news as supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because\nAt Christmas people have thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually no\nWell your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that ... is\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which has seemed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become windy calling is most of widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books missed on subjects that we huge Lee important in terms of understanding the crash\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had to spend a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics was taught in universities around the world and has that changed\nIt has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they give bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration felt by students and teachers around the world\nHas given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others of building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionately about and so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the core charity [noise]\n\nAnd so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the core charity [noise]\n\nBut with a different curriculum be enough\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper cools to bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nAnd that's a much easier to comics professor at Stanford University in the U.S\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to the bond even criminal behavior by bank because that can threaten them financial stability\nThere is definitely a problem it is a very very shocking they remain really fantastic early in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end\nIgnoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding incentives and all the deception and fraud and all the excessive endangerment that's entirely unnecessary it's just taken is given it's just what they accept the system\nAnd does she think this has changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is more about you know very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big groups at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can we prevent it stuff happens\nNot much of a comfort to think that the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joe Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recording was on the totally unreal list\nHappens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance record them is on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right he dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind belief that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it would be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives I'd miss\nUsed his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained\nMarkets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys and sells things and the self interest and threads freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust sticking that's one of the Nobel Prize for economics by them to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just\nEveryone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody know something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't\nThe fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes at in Dr needed their students\nThat markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the heart of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were signs ... only works if you imagine all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to the economy can be counted\nJournalist Katrin muscles book who cooked announcements dinner argues the traditional economic theories and methods only makes sense if you mentioned humanity be self

relevant to his economic decision making he's that sort of rational fake calculating brain that is always acting additive self interest and all of a set of characteristics or characteristics that we have been told to view as male\nAnd even more obvious it's sort of all the characteristics that economics guys to great lengths trying to excluded from these models like emotions family the poor taste failings compassion out\nThe case to great lengths trying to excluded from these models like emotions family the faulty failings compassion and altruism\nAnd all of these things that we have been told that these are not economically relevant is not anything that we need to studying economics days like send you the same things that we have been torched view as female\nObey the off to the Chrysler
