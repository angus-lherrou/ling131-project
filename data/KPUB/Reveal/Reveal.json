with top rated schools\nI was extremely optimistic easy like I don't see anybody saying no today and the first time we actually had his heart talking to landlords and was honestly it was really discouraging\nDoes the fact that under mess quest that landlords have very little financial risk and yet there's still so cautious of the program does that suggest that there's that there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nThat's exactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now I'm ... they have this guarantee\nThat everything will

to have a paper backup system of voting it's called paper not\nHighly complex computers paper\nA real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents for schools to

reveals by Duncan picks up the story [noise]\nYeah yeah so right now I'm plugging the machine and\nLoading lamb has a voting machine in his living room this is what one looks\nLike on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta his specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines he has is the kind of Georgia uses edits polling places the machine it's bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and the Bible Logan boots it up so it was actually touch ... glitter and then it's the can pressing the image\nIs one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that full time at the beginning and use that as my ring time\nThis is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cybersecurity titans that's a major red flag\nIn fact dear he's had been criticized by technologists basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines is paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nLimited truly only by one's imagination to commit fraud on a paper ballot\nShe also said that even though Logan findings for troubling they're different from a problem with voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different secured systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly not Bernhardt is a PHD student at the University of Michigan\nHe studies the arteries and their vulnerability\nThat says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you inject information or inject\nIt's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really injecting permission or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of this tree the way it is set up is that that virus could get transmitted every other part of the tree\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day\nYou at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side where ... people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia's system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adapting paper ballots over electronic wind for the midterm elections\nJudge any Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's pace in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none that\nHacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will failed to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia the research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert\nSo that's where we are Georgia it\nThe research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with informal systems and machines but very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling election now the secretary of state's office does\nThe people I talked to say that change won't really make much of a difference\nThey say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight to ... and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that\nWe know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question\nLet me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\nReveals by Duncan brought us the story\n[noise]\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp established a commission that will look at options for replacing the curve voting
