in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches\nPolitical science at both in college and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us my pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political at these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast\nFifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting a job on\nYes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nAnd there's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season on through\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that ...\nDid a or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being connected to terrorist organizations and that kind of explicit attack\nIs not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric and public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is that an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it has a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boat in college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us my pleasure and tomorrow on weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our political

G culminated this week with Saudi prosecutors saying the Turkish evidence shows his killing was premeditated\nHow could this affect the relationship between the United states Saudi Arabia and its crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon or MPs as you know we're joined now by Robin Wright\nA distinguished scholar at the Wilson Center a contributing writer for the New Yorker Robin thanks so much for being with us great to be with you Scott and let's begin to the crown prince is it possible he would lose power over the ... the fare\nWell they're four different options one is that he stays in power that the international furor eventually settled down and he managed to kind of orchestrate his ability to stay on the throne um he is a de facto leader in Saudi Arabia\nAnd uh he managed to kind of orchestrate his ability to stay on the throne um he is a de facto leader in Saudi Arabia because his father is age to nailing the second scenario is that he is replaced his crown prince and there is\nPrecedent for that are over the last three years to other crown princes have been pushed aside in part to make room for him there's a third option or that his powers a weekend\nThat the king of points others in the royal family did to assume some of the roles that uh MVSA has managed to accumulate in his office over the last a year and a half and the fourth is that there was a kind of physical challenges there was to king Feisal back in Nineteen Seventy five\n... years older son was photographed meeting the crown prince earlier this week I'm for a lot of people who was heart wrenching to see and it was shortly after he'd be allowed to travel to the U.S were according to reports she's arrived there\nIs it possible someone told him posed with the prince and you can get out and hear\nAbsolutely uh there's no question the royal family had banned him from traveling since his father had left the kingdom to go into exile and there had to be a lot of behind the scene maneuvering including a request specifically by the United\nStates and secretary of state Pompeo to allow him to leave the country and joined his brothers in the United states three of a ... sons are American citizens and I gather the fourth son was not\nA head of the ... was in Turkey this week being briefed ... to ... what do we know about what she was told and what you do\nWell the CIA hasn't

alleged tape of\nI'm Jamal of last moments and what happened to him inside the Saudi consulate in this temple I think this is going to be a pivotal moment for the Trump Administration it has to make a very hard call what to do about\nAn ally that has been pivotal in three of a President Trump's five most important foreign policy goals\nAnd those are well the first one is obviously this elusive Arab Israeli peace plan that President Trump originally said was not going to be as difficult as everyone thought and it has been repeatedly delayed\nIt was scheduled to be rolled up this fall or the

backed Internet research agency to use Twitter bucked the influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports\nAndrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem to beat and joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency ... interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthems\nWell at first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at\nWe're sowing discord this issue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality this issue has been pretty\nNational anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\nMm So it it it wasn't directed achieving a certain result just to just er things up apparently\nAnd the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord and this is in some ways just the perfect\nAnd what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on\nTwenty years is not a lot of time if you're

in this week although thankfully no one's harm bomb threats\nSo much harder than others to have fun with the news Oh yes but we know that we have a particular role or handling all that stuff that's your job and we know that what our audience wants\nIs for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff in focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring

it because he hasn't spoken to me since [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared post presidency that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job in the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually very funny guy can tell a story then sure people will go on and they'll thing\nAnd we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story then sure people will go on

talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches\nPolitical science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us my pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ed these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit the policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those\nTogether you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality\nAnd so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line\nAnd there's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season aren't you [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being\nConnected to terrorist organizations and that kind of explicit attack\nIs not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nYeah this is a tough one to decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nTone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz Bowden college who's co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us my pleasure and Tamara weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our political

neighborhood um we are kind of standing at an intersection it pretty rainy and cold and there are a lot of police cars a lot of ambulances\nUm and there are members of the community some are crying summer not really sure what's happening and then you know you see people who haven't heard anything about this so far who are on a morning lock her morning run and then they see these police cars and they're not not quite sure what's happening\n[noise] do do we know anything about the dignity of the victims at this point [noise]\nUm we have not been briefed police have yet to do a at another update with us at ... the last I heard which was about an hour ago um they had a suspect in custody they were not commenting on victims but there were a fate holidays\n... and there's still a morning for residents at the neighborhood to shelter in place which would suggest that they they are not yet altogether certain that it's just this one person they have and toasted you want to show\n[noise] yeah that's what I Would assume too I mean we don't have any information about that but the the police are asking members of the community to stay inside um this\nHappened at a synagogue just a couple blocks away from where we are now um I've been told that you know usually on a on a Saturday morning like this are fifty or sixty people who might come to a worship there and um so it's it's it's right in our neighborhood right here so we're not quite\nThe people who might come to a worship there and um so it's it's it's right in our neighborhood right here so we're not quite sure what's going

concentrated neighborhood it's a beautiful neighborhood big\nBrick houses I'm a Jewish community center is a couple blocks away and so this is a really important part of the Jewish community and that's part of Pennsylvania\nAnd we will we will tell our listeners we are aware of the fact that there are multiple numbers that are being reported on various social media platforms and in fact uh\nUh some social media platforms who purport to know the identity of the person who is\nIn custody we do not report up until we can certify that as a fact uh and and sort of Lucy I'm sure you're aware of that but\nOfficials have not for him that identity do you have the correct that is true or um I Know you and the other members of the media going to be on the scene it must be hard to get to gain access but I gather that the police and and perhaps the mayor will be having a press conference right\nYes there are represented from the police department here governor wolf a is actually also here and I was all that I'm the mayor if you're obviously but I'm told the other uh politicians and lawmakers from the area are making their way here to offer as much help and support as

thanks very much for Twenty years of sober thoughtful\nNews ... exactly we knew that people just didn't take NPR seriously enough with all your frivolously\nAnd hide jinx so we decided that we needed to finally try to acquire a reputation for sober consideration at this network and I'm Glad to have done it\nThanks so much I'm Serious question yes um they're serious chilling events a school shooting range church bombings in this week although thankfully no one's harm bomb threats so much harder than others to have fun with\nOh yes but we know that we have a particular role or handling all that stuff\nThat's your job and we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff in focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more we feel an obligation\nAbout the bad stuff will highlight that all I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring the silly [noise]\nYou've had so many um famous gas including of course of a president of United States to two presidents of the yeah we had the rock Obama before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to be sense [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared to host president say that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case it but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah um how could you not and I miss Carl Kasell\nWe all you've had some great partners I have and I've been blessed and I have stood on the shoulders are next to do the shoulders\nOf giants as everyone knows are not only was Carl Kasell original judge and scorekeeper he was our presiding spirit and he still is even though he's no longer with us\nAnd bill Curtis has a voice that's on loan from the heavens and he also much like Carl\nHas a really interesting sense if you are cautious yes and he runs a little shall we say salacious I Believe is the public radio word will use\nAnd every now and then our audience gets a glimpse of that but my favorite thing is when off air he'll let loose with the profanity and it is stunning\nFavorite thing is when off air he'll let loose with the profanity and it is stunning to hear that voice using that language oh my gosh you can it can boil the hair right off the it was quite fun\nBefore we go who richer seeing music the music of course

sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox did the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down\nAnd obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up to ... Yankees had chances in sixth inning bases loaded basis lives in the seventh inning\nAnd if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic\nUh Houston Astros put the crunch on Cleveland seven to two court club or a great pitcher got clue or clubs or you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and eighty games the Yankees won a hundred games but the actual still won a hundred hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like champions again even though for a lot of ... that a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but then that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut up against the Atlanta Braves and\nThis is interesting because nobody seemed to be any

so all of a sudden you're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball\nAnd let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knock them out while the Dodgers have the national league champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year I listen to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm\nAt the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with that I kinda like what the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the rocks already on the road merit to that and maybe you go to Colorado and things change but I\nI really like Milwaukee and the Dodgers I think this is just going to be great all of it's really good\nFinally we need to mention a twenty games suspension or in hockey Tom Wilson other cap shit Oscar sunkist or the blues on his Blind Side ... yeah NHL seems to be reacting to to head

some 'cause in in drilled them in the head it's also that this is his\nFifth is his fourth suspension in the last hundred and five games so they have concluded that this guy when he gets on the ice is out there to hurt people and the one of the things we always talk about with football is the danger but the thing we don't talk about is that hockey is just as dangerous and the guys that come in at a pretty high rate of speed\nAnd when you look at at the suspension now they're they're not playing around in their concluding this guy does not belong on the ice\nOr Brian thanks so much thinking he's

diversity of views [laughter] which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote one port that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian balls before it now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] uh what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually\nEnough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it than look to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true on the other had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of that because she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople there basically to his cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve and the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee um\nThat she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNo the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and as an inherently difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent ... ah until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end\nGuilty beyond a reasonable doubt and you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise] ...

Court today\nThis despite what we can imagine to be the objections of his fellow Democratic senators and what we know to be some very vocal objections of protesters who gathered at the Capitol Taylor Wilson is one of those protesters results way west Virginian and founder of the women's activist group\nBoss babes in that state as rules and thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me and what your immediate reaction to senator Manchin Cheney intends to vote for drugs capital\nIt's devastating but it's honestly not super surprising\nYeah well yeah that it's been indicated also I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made that senator mantra news just reflecting the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that mostly most people at the party Kavanaugh here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for reelection and thirty days and he he has under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to the way the Republican base\nWell but when you use a politician to being a politician or the that's not much of a surprise visit\nI think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah we'll but when you use a politician to being a politician\nIs though that's not much of a surprise visits I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did do that to him yesterday or on Thursday\nWe'll tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office on Monday and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday\nThat didn't really go well on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of\nSexual assault and ask them how they plan to vote and he their way he he was very engaging the conversation he had to step out of the room but did it I got back from like ... you you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely gauge he has got a question um I Do believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that it's reflected in this decision\nDoes you're probably continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers to\nOur fight does continue so uh as far as the Senate goes we it he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had a because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis\nAnd so he kinda runny nose and believe in opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and uh he's just a bad guy and I think he knows that\nDemocrat ... vote and this is old your opinion with me underscore this is my\nOpinion do of course this is my opinion yes of course\nAnd I think he knows that Democrat or they're ... so this is your opinion with me underscore this is my\n... of course this is my opinion yes of course um\nSo yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue or yeah so we're working on I'm working at a statewide to change things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if if it sounds as if you have accepted senator mansions vote for what it is and and still support among the great many issues and I I've got to tell you this this sounds very civilized and democratic to me\nI'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as support has because I think the I think Morsi's worst choice mansion does still support us on the AC a and tax reform

sexual harassment reports that come in only a fraction get funded for legal help\nSome people are coming to us you know two years after this has happened to them for five years after this has happened to ten years after this has happened to them\nBecause they never felt comfortable coming forward before and the way the law is you have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of time so some of those women are out of time\nSome of those women who are coming forward are independent contractors and unless you live in certain states you're not covered by discrimination law and so it's a

the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox did the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down\nAnd obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up to ...

court club or a great pitcher got clue or club at you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and they gave me the Yankees won a hundred games but the actual still won a hundred hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beach you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like champions again even though for a lot a lot a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they to stretch shut up against the Atlanta Braves\nAnd yeah this is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs who I picked to go to the world series had the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the play offs by Tuesday night\nAnd you don't forget that but go ahead and now I'm just saying that it's it's a crazy here and and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the Bruins got shut out last night so all of

National League champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm at the right time as well

it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives

whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nThis is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court well I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers\nGay and lesbian

Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race

from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference and was about to start in Pittsburgh this morning\nEleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people were injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning Hi Lou\nUh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well what we know is that eleven\nPeople were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened\nThose eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a an as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um well it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil I'm like in a loving people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in\nDecades yeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nThis morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere\nUp to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nAnd and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people or\nYou know grappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nYeah but I didn't mention there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want to save and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen ... so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and ... and so uh that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nYeah incredibly moving and somber\nUm what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nAnd something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the Senate God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with\nIt's a little over a week until election day coverage is twenty four seven TV is filled with ads so is everybody fired up\nYou know I don't watch educated enough to follow the politicians or something like ... where\nIn Pennsylvania to talk with voters and ... that can the latest on the shooting in Pittsburgh next time on all things considered from NPR News\nWe can do all things considered begins at five o'clock this afternoon here on ...\nFace a his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime right and and he you know he\nAnd the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was uh\nRight and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was a you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of\nGrappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I think\nThese situations and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime so they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we've said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant of motives\nThat tells us something about why this might have happened again that still under investigation but um it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and\nDating and we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about

Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters or the teen of voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters ... but when we talk about white voters we rarely meant and their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests than there are varied\nAbout white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense right\nWhite is the default so\nI have treated frequently that when we\nSee something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white\nIn front of that statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting this story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about my people [noise]\nI think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue and in fact\nWhat the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not\nActually reporting what everyone is Harry and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nToday's can a you'd days sponsors are petrified forest national park on kids county and Gary groupie pleased to announce that petrified forest national talk without the guy did that country hikes weekends in November and December hike details on the ... website and Facebook pages\nFrom northern Arizona university this is Arizona Public radio NPR News and classical music on cayenne eight years maybe eight point seven sites that Katie you be Ninety One point seven ... paying eight eight Ninety point seven show less\nThan a dean Ninety One point seven page K.

steadily declined since deporting the country more than two weeks ago\nSome of dropped out some state in Mexico and others have been deported she reports many has landed back in the place where the caravan originally started the central bus station in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula\nAt night the dimly lit station throws dark shadows over small groups of people spread out on the concrete

couldn't walk anymore he says the officials caught him in a group of the others middlemen he meant it was also deployed low level of sort of what I wanted to do with the original caravan but couldn't scrape up cash fast enough to him in his\nWord spread quickly through social media and cable news back on October twelve people were gathering here at the bus station ready to head north\nBy nightfall thousands were on buses out of this violence city more than a third of the country's homicides are committed here\nAnd then it says along with the violence there are also not enough jobs\nThat are like and I think a lot of us either that or the support of the buildings that are left or the middle of all I don't know if a little bit\nTo do I keep going up bus tickets go up medicine everything but our salaries they stay the same he says the poverty here is killing us he says he can't beat his four kids\nTwo thirds of Hondurans live in poverty corruption and impunity add to the rampant

the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock\nAre we getting it getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric thing also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and Carolyn ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she

edition from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro a terrible shooting in Pittsburgh bombs in the mail this is a fraud political moment and here to help us make sense of it as NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson good morning thanks for having me [noise]\nSo obviously I'm a terrible news out of Pittsburgh we got the names of those who I'm actually were killed by this in this attack\nYeah let's just make a few things clear this was the worst anti Semitic attacking us history it occurred just days after the largest\nAssassination attempt on political leaders in this case all Democrats and targets of the president's in us history and we're not going to have the big debate about whether extreme rhetoric including some of the president's rhetoric\nHelped insight this but the president has\nMade a lot of unifying statements he said these acts were evil he has also gone on to campaign and hold rallies kind of partisan politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did\nBut just before a rally in\nIn politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did but just before a rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nI Would like to be able to have its own that I have because I feel very strongly about it and I have a much different John frankly the press was\nEven handed Russia was fair I'd have a much different tone all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault but as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there's what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\n... this is a president who has not really embrace the role of United and chief\nNo he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role as sort of the moral leader of the nation but he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change she's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes it energize his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race in fear of crime fear of immigration and it's kind of a social media business model you know the algorithms that YouTube and and other social media organizations know that more extreme content keeps viewers\nOn longer and this is what the president feels works\nNo that more extreme content keeps viewers on longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and that he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you know mid term elections are just over a week away well the events of this past week affects the elections and if so how\nI think for the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were on a roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs\nSo that might be the biggest effect\nNPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson ... thank you so much thank you\nThis morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case his or say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn now to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida mourning\nMourning was All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect to say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation well are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested or so\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's a perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources\nAll these explosives and that put the nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source that a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help\nAre getting a picture of how he became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building and nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van he hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale\nIn Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year that's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I began making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud he didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nThe financier who's been in the news so much lately and in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you suddenly co workers including one who was in that time yet\n... was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed\nSay I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWas talking about Hitler he loves Hitler Hitler and we should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much\nThank you lose the leading up to the mid term election season we've been looking at what voters will find on their ballots the big governors' races the different kinds of ballot measures well we've just got today and one more Sunday before election day\nSo it's time to look at the too big a house and Senate will do the Senate first and we'll do it with NPR lead political editor to medical not to narrow good morning to medical good morning ...\nA third of the seats and the senator up as the constitution requires Democrats were facing some tough mass but then we started hearing about a blue wave how's that water looking\nWell look the blue wave is certainly real but it's more likely to be in the house then in the Senate and that's because in the Senate there are a lot more uh seats that are held by Democrats in red states that are up you have the worst landscape since the direct election of senators\nIn Nineteen fourteen for either party that's because you have twenty six Democrats that are defending seats and just nine Republicans so will the Republicans pick up seats then\nIt's very possible in fact a you know some handicappers are looking at a potential a best case scenario for Democrats being net even right now it's fifty one forty nine in the Senate\nAnd a more likely scenario something like two to three seats lost from when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of this cycle and through the cycle they were hoping to sort of be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscape\nAsked for and when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of the cycle and through the cycle they were hoping to sort of be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscaping twenty Eighteen where they could go on often\nThe best target for Democrats as in Nevada with Dean Heller and Heller is actually started to do a lot better a lot of those Republican a defense is a lot of those those Senate seats or Arizona Tennessee Texas Nevada they've all started

J. C. dot org and from Americans for the arts\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm Lugosi Navarro in these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from\nAffect our point of view what's often called identity politics and when we talk about identity and politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race to the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are the voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters ... but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engaged in identity\nTend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default\nSo I have tweet it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white\nIn front of that statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact\nWhat the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why ... is when they talk about the past the good old days and Nineteen\nTrump into the White House another way politicians may not explicitly say why but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so there is also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white

Ron thanks so much for being with us\nGood to be with the Scott let's begin to of course with the president's reaction to the Saudi explanation as it stands now it's been in several different places for the past couple of weeks for the death of ... uh the president calls it credible lumps in Congress don't\nSaudis say he was killed in a fist fight with Fifteen men\nAny child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of this story the Saudis have now abandoned\nIts intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual\nAnd that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales\nPresident Trump made that clear this week while he was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is focused\nBut president made that clear this week by spelling out is gender like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about cabin on the caravan law and order and common sense\nAnd a president and other Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the

to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop as for law and order that's the phrase is older states rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the phrase has also been used\nAs code for resistance to social change and common sense is another familiar phrase a recently used as a political cultural by the Tea Party\nAs you mentioned round the care of and it's been a feature of the the rallies that President Trump has been addressing but\nHe's also threatened to withhold some foreign aid over it has me\nYes the stopping the caravan and the threat of withheld assistance is substituting right now for the border wall which the president has made the symbol of his immigration policy and much more and which so far he has not been able to build\nPresident Trump is returning to immigration is a campaign issue amid a standoff between Mexican police in a caravan of about three thousand Central American migrants\nPresident Trump brought up

did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called cause showed used at the unacceptable\nBut also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like bowling and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment worth a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response but\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks or as is the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about this\nAs is the number of jobs and we'll say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting a given given up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like eh not so with the Saudis now\nAll of this comes up its president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talked about how does he present his argument at his rallies\nHe is really trying to get the base his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh\nCalls Democrats who protested ... Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language or any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border\nAnd lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of a ...\nAnd here's John ... thanks very much for being with us thank you Scott [noise] while President Trump says he wants\nBut your mouth to show G and here's John ... thanks very much for being with us thank yous got\nWell President Trump says he wants more information before deciding how to respond to the Saudi explanation of ... death\nSome members of the U.S Congress has called for sanctions on Saudi Arabia the Trump Administration has appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space\nThis week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least a friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince don't pay a total reporters on his return to the U. S. the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWe have long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n... is right about that for decades us presidents from both parties have felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly endless stand resident of the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about this sort of transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or inhibit it to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about the show ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military [noise] those are the biggest orders in the history of this

distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy says Rachel Bronson author of the book sicker than oil America's uneasy partnership with Saudi Arabia\nThey invest in long term goals they invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both of us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed\nFormer President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran but Brunson says Trump has embraced the kingdom more tightly than ever\nThe tournament station has put all of their ... basket and they've been very very public about

uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ...\nWhen he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both Washington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancelled that a hundred and

to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries on to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the in the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending

included a photo of the smiling face of metal Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for ...\nBut she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old introduction continent of high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and Lynch and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry [noise]\nBerlin to think so much for being with thanks for having me first we're [noise] we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nYou're drug ... more than one program I go there to yes\nThe case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry that hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our ...\nA huge barrier to recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son in her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service for ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a\nA video of Matty singing a bonding rate song she's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and

I don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they think it's a big deal\nAnd I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation with with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\n[laughter] uh Howard thank you you're in San Francisco or their commemorating fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the medal podium a thanks very much for being with us Howard oh it was terrific thank you\nWhen the baby of an HIV positive mother in South Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin choice transplant part of the mothers live or to the infant and risk transferring HIV or\nBut the child grow sicker and most likely die child received part of her mother's liver and so far there has been no sign of HIV\nThe surgery is your first and could significantly change the pool of organ donors in South Africa are about twenty percent of the population is infected with HIV largest epidemic in the world Dr Harriet Etheridge is a medical bioethicist at Vince Donald Gordon medical center that's where the trench flat happened and\nShe was part of the team of doctors who helped prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nToday and I had any how's the baby doing\nShe joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nThank you very much for having me on your show how's the baby doing\nAnd the baby's doing very very well we are very yeah after the transplant surgery happen now and to see this child alive and driving under the circumstances with this world famous case is\nObviously enormously gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made\nWill help us understand that decision because you have to wear a lot of different factors didn't\n[noise] yet so we knew that there was a really high possibility that through doing the surgery we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for liver Darnah\nFor three times the average and this child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat are the parents children\n[noise] so the parents were saying to us why ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy wouldn't you consider us so they were sick need that to wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the Darnah\nThat she could be a Darnah and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promote sending Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible so it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from the very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the lives of their child\n... threw juice in this uh this case the more people know about it we'll look contribute something to lift\nShe wanted to save the life of their child\n[noise] doctor Etheridge do think this uh this case the more people know about it we'll contribute something to lifting the stigma they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to hope so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted says the U.S and South Africa although we have this very well integrated national and AIDS treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive tests and and you're on your medication you living in a normal life\nThen that shouldn't ... from being an organ donor it shouldn't stuff peace and having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people\nCan do this that that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma\nRadio bringing NPR News in classical music to know than Arizona\nCan a you eighty eight point seven facts death ...

G died while visiting the Saudi conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage\nPresident Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing\nHe did not criticized the Saudis and beer down gun Jay was with the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saturday's the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious to Mr showed jihad died or in their custody depression was asked about a world tour in an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved that I think it's a great first step\nUm a lot of people Trump's referring to the teen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called cause showed used at the unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts\nThe Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment whereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work\nWhich means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly\nAs retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work\nWhich means six hundred thousand jobs\nIt's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks or as the number of jobs and we'll say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting a given given up quickly in the past he has leveled\nVery blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like eh not so with the Saudis now all of this\nComes up its president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talked about how does he present his argument at his rallies\nHe is really trying to get the base his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle to confirm justice Brett Kavanaugh calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh an unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nA ... and he talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation to every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien\nThe planet come on and come on and ah so\nEvery trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and ah\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of a ...\nAnd ... John ... thanks very much for being with us thank yous got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of ... showed gee\nWe turn now to evil do there he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience to Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that or was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president of how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with her out\nWork with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end\nThe indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of a value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests\nTrees behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests and we want to maintain does interest but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments of that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that\nDo not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen top two weeks is unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nInstead of depressed 'cause we've got a new ad campaign to encourage tourism or at least not disappoint

Simon we've learned over the past few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any fish in a ritual that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touch many readers this week it included a photo of a smiling face\nAnd the ... that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of smiling face of metal ... with her toddler son eight and it was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for money but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old when production ... high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal in ... near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her\nSister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates um\nHighly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share ... addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define the way she lift\nAnd to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son and her ... in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service from ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate songs is just sitting in the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support\nWe didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own addiction recovery and family members and not spend a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat Bonnie rich on there [noise] I Can't make you left me\nIndeed
