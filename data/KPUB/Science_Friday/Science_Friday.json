environmental scientists were raising the alarm about the tiny beads of plastics and face wash\nAnd now these tiny invisible polymer particles seemed to have worm their way into everything else on

others like the subjects in science it's popular science senior editors Sophie Bush way\nThere have you back next to me here so ... when we go let's talk about this where exactly to the researchers find these microbes\nSo the Bush were yes have you back nice to be here\nSo when we're when we go let's talk about this word directly to the researchers find is Margaret plastic\nSo researchers um they had a group of eight subjects I'm from countries all over Europe and Asia and they essentially had these subjects keep a food diary for a week and then at the end of the week they were they took a stool sample from themselves and sent it to the researchers and then the researchers had the fun job of picking through that\nThey were looking for ten different types of plastic\nAnd they found these these plastic types that on nine of them and they were in all of the samples stool samples to his own life or our bud and yet we eat them and then we send about the other end\nOnly a matter of time right with all the micro plastic around her\nRight researchers if on micro plastics in tap water in the er it's in seafood um because a lot of these plastic fragments get into the waterways and then\n... them and we eat the fish\nOr the other thing is that you know a lot of us drink water from plastic bottles or food out of plastic takeout containers are that's been wrapped in plastic and there's all sorts of chances for fragments to come off so the definition of a micro plastic is that it's smaller than\nFive millimeters but it can be much much smaller than that you know some of these fragments or on the nano meter scale\nAnd and we suspect that there is no harm coming from the\n... it's very difficult to tell you because it it's hard to sort of ... per se out um you can't really feed people some people plastic samples and not beat other people plastic samples at this point it's just not ethically\nFeasible but um it it's hard shell maybe they're just passengers harmlessly it's also possible that they could be accumulating and that um a lot of these plastics carry chemicals that they made in each into the human body so it's it's I wouldn't tell people I Would say don't don't panic because it could be yes it could be that there are harmless but it's very difficult\nKnow those of us of a certain age always thought that if\nTell people I Would say don't don't panic

I guess being from the u._k. a pint is the right measurement you would be using for blood I Believe that's\nSomething we show it either so I think it's the one thing we have in common along with miles [laughter]\nVery ah they're all these different connotations of by by the Romans drank it Homer used it in the odyssey to allow the day to speak why there's so many almost mystical ideas about what\nI think because it's such a long time it wasn't really understood and the only thing that was understood was that when you thought it was probably a very bad thing because it was usually followed by injury and death I Love to see it that way\nAnything that was understood was that when you saw it it was probably a very bad thing because it was usually followed by injury and death so obviously it was a really powerful substance\n... um but it wasn't really understood very well into like the last hundred hundred and fifty years so\nIt was given this power because if if it could kill you so easily when you lost it and obviously if he drank it till if you will homeless mother you drunk a bit of sheep's blood because she happened to be handy and hell and\nThey could probably revived peace I think that's how we got the idea of lettuce is life given cups of coffee medically it is a life getting substance mhm\n[laughter] I don't I Want to ask our listeners to join in aid for for Seventy two for eight to five five is our number you can also tweet us ... fry I you know right from the beginning of the book I I I had an affinity for it because you mentioned he mo the magnificent which I remember seeing\nWhat you are the fastest and who's ever had that I remember\nThat in this in the fifties and uh I remember seeing it I remember part where they were squeezing news burning blood out of a pipe like would be an artery and they're stuck with me ever since and I'm so happy that you you mentioned that because it really put it on the radar screen for me\nYeah I mean I just can't I Can't even remember how I came across a bit I was a much much happier passed and once I had I mean it's it's slightly eccentric shall we call ... but it's it's just wonderful and\nIt's got it's got the poetry Scott Mets and it's got science has got everything and it's yeah I I it's very hard to describe though I mean once you've seen 'em\n... listening to being competitive railroads which many nights it's\nIt's Clinton indescribable film but not really was looking up like the early days of television\nI'm ... listening to his being compared to railroads which many nights it's\nYeah it's quite and indescribable film but not really was looking up\nLike the early days of television quite indescribable in pretty good in some of the things we did well let's talk about uh the taboos about blood you visited India where there's a man trying to break this taboo tell us about that\nThis is a guy called his shorts name is Maria guy he's got a long time I'll name he's from South\nIndia and I'm a lot of Indians will know him better as pat man\nBecause it's been a Bollywood film about him about his story is extraordinary he was in a very poorly educated um young man and his wife came home one day hiding something behind her back and he ah he thought she was teasing and they had a bit of a tussle\nAnd she eventually um showed him that she was carrying a bloody menstrual Iraq so a lot of Indian women use cloth they don't have ... they don't caught food sanitary pads\nConventional finish pad so shanty like millions of other Indian women on across the developing world was using cloth there's nothing wrong with that if you can clean and I'm wash it Hi Jeannie clay but because of taboos that often doesn't happen\nAnyway ... I'm a shanty why she couldn't afford 'em commercial than she pads because he'd seen them in the market and she said well it's either a sandwich pad or milk and we need milk\nAnd from that I Am\nBecause he's a bit of an extraordinary fellow um spent twelve years coming up with a low cost sanitary pads machine that can be money they'll ... can be afraid to pilot ... women\nAnd there are now four thousand of them all over 'em pulled over the world but the way he got to understanding he had to do a reverse engineering to understand what was in ...\nAll over 'em pulled over the world but the way he got to understanding he had to do a reverse engineering to understand what was in commercial than if you pass because he thought it was just caught and yeah so he decided as the best way to do that obviously was to wake up his own uterus in the form of\nUm a a a goat Blatter filled with a goat blood\nAnd I'm Sorry yeah sorry with uh football's a filled with goats slogan blood and he had touched it to his clothing and had little pump and went around all day and every so often pumped it and so I Try to simulate the experience of aim instructing woman um and he learned a lot\n[laughter] I think a lot of men what if they did that [laughter] um and also because he lived in South\nIndia where it's hot he uh he was wearing white so which is pretty much everyone is night might not matter what century pad advertising has told us over the years and so you know there was stains and leaks and nice to have a lot of time checking behind themselves like women do a lot and um he eventually came understood what was in such pets and\nHas revolutionized synch pets in India quite an amazing fellow\n... to ... you know more men should try that I make sure how the trials and tribulations\n... women go ask him with football [laughter] I I think there's so many great little ... of moments in your book on a little statistics that just jumps out let me go through a few of them you have a staff that every three seconds someone received a blood transfusion\nWow ... ... you know the joke behind that is they ought to find that guy and stop him from there [laughter] but\nIt's such a ... in the states is that she every two seconds is that right yeah and uh I was given the breakdown of those figures and idle idle makes sense I how how\nAnd yeah and uh I was given the breakdown of the biggest and idle idle makes sense\nI how how how did this idea of banking blood first come about\nWell when I mean we haven't been this the system that we're all used to which is the mass donation and I'm supply and transfusion of blood it's really not very old a total of about a hundred and Twenty years old and in the beginning I'm In the U.S in the u._k. they\nThey ... they started in pretty similar fashion that\nPeople were selling that blood um they had this project that they could sell them on and so they did\nKnow leaving a union of blood cell is in New York and there are people who men usually who traveled around the country I'm selling that blood so they're with their own kind of blood market um but eventually in the Nineteen thirties uh adults in Chicago called ... to ... I'm trying to organize things a bit better and he was\nConvinced that the best thing to do 'em ... blood as a commodity really so he thought that was when ten must come out and if you used blood you should supply blood so he sets up a blood bank and I've actually that transformed\nI'm In the Nineteen seventies in in the u._s. um the notion of paying full blood um died out and it's now a whole donated not illegal to sell your blood in the U.S but it's just not it's frowned upon and not done\nOne of the you know I when I was in college a new lots of college students who was showing their blood for for money just you know for some spending cash\nCan still do that but you you what you're doing is telling blood plasma and so you're selling the yellow stuff fifty five percent of liquid in your blood and um yeah you can\nPlasma and so you're selling the yellow stuff fifty five percent of liquid in your blood and um\nYeah you can do that the u._s. has got very very generous regulations that house and you can do that can do it twice a week if you want to know other countries on ... plasma during his do it every couple of weeks but um yeah you can and uh the fifty dollars a pop selling a plasma us so yeah it's a good income stream for other people\nAnd no you're right that that the U.S is seen as the ... pack of plasma [laughter] like where do the cartel applies so\nWell that's it that wasn't my phrase that came from someone in the classroom or industry but it's it's certainly a global giant and and the selling off last night supplies Seventy percent of plasma in

studies suggest than breathing through your nose can be linked to improve memory\nAnd that's a new to view mouth breeders out they're here to untangle how olfaction is linked to deeper parts of the brain controlling emotion and memory is Christine is on oh there's this new professor at Northwestern University Feinberg school of medicine doctors on and welcome to science friday\nHi thank you I'm happy to be here we're happy to have you so what is so special about breathing through your nose\nWell a nose breathing is special because it's how we smell and smell is a fascinating and really unique sensory system so evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood\nAnd really unique sensory system\nSo evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood of our sensory systems and there are several\nKey aspects of smell that make it particularly interesting and that make nose breathing really different from mouth breathing so for one thing the smell neurons which live up way up at the very top of our nasal cavities\nThey actually touch the air as it flows in and out of our noses just during natural breathing and this is really unusual because these olfactory neurons are the only part of our central nervous system that makes direct contact with our external world\nAnd the way that this information gets from these neurons inside of our noses\nInto the brain is different from all other sensory systems so all other sensory systems information relays through a structure called the thalamus before it reaches the cortex and higher order brain areas\nBut in the olfactory system information flows straight from the nose\nInto the cortex and higher order brain areas as well without going through the thalamus um and what's special is that these olfactory structures are located in a part of the brain called the limbic system\nWhich is involved and emotion and fear learning and memory so this gives little faction of sort of privileged access to emotion and memory areas in the brain and and because a nose breathing is smelling\nNasal inhalation provides a sort of entry point by which breathing rhythms can modulate brain activity in these structures\n... or so just the act of breathing in through your nose was you know also since the air is coming in and alert\nSo just the act was breathing through your nose was you know it was also since the air is coming in and alert these this pathway on the end point in your brain and say hey something interesting was about to happen\nRight it yes actually it does so that the receptors inside of the nasal cavity\nOr not only responsive to chemicals so they're not only monitoring ah the chemicals in our environment but they also are ... so they can detect the air flowing in and out of the\nThe nose yes um and we found that these natural respiratory rhythms just breathing even in the absence of any smell\nOf drives activity in olfactory areas but interestingly these these respiratory driven brain waves they don't stop there so we found that they also propagate to nearby limbic structures the the ones involved and emotion and memory so what this means is that as we breathe\nActivity across the limbic system is rhythmically increasing or decreasing within hails enact sales I'm In this pattern what we found is that it's only present when you're breathing through your nose so if you breathe through your mouth that rhythmic limbic activity goes away\n... you know a lot of us believe maybe erroneous lawyer but you can suddenly smell something that you remember from Thirty years ago right is is that a ... a real thing or why and I'm a well for me it's real but why is that something special Tibet you sensory Oregon\nYeah you know the evidence is not clear that studies sort of conflicting on that um a couple of studies have found that perhaps olfactory memories memories tend to be earlier I'm not ...\nA couple of studies have found that perhaps olfactory memories memories tend to be earlier I'm not necessarily stronger um but I Would say there's no clear consensus on on whether or not that's true\n... one of ... what about breathing through your mouth or do anything for you I mean [noise] uh we we use as far as his tasting food we've always been told that you smell the food through your nose and it helps your taste buds taste what which were actually doing is there a connection there\nRight that is true that is a good point um and that's\nThat's what's called retro nasal olfaction so when when we have food inside of our mouth I'm the air can get from our oral cavity into our nasal cavity but it flows and the backwards direction so it's going out word rather than in word\nUm and it definitely impacts flavors and and taste yes us\nTo talk about your study how were you able to study this I understand that you were able to test this with an F. MRI\nActually I'm no that's an in that's a very interesting point um we did not use fmri right because in the human brain the olfactory structures are actually located very very deep almost in the center of the brain uh making them very hard to reach noninvasive Lee so we can't record from these areas\nFrom the electrodes on the surface of the scalp\nAnd functional neuro imaging uh we cannot really measure\nUm brain oscillation with that technique so to do this study we worked in collaboration with brain surgeons who implant electrodes wires directly into these Olympic areas for patients who are undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy and this provides is a really rare operates\nDirectly into these Olympic areas for patients who are undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy and this provides is a really rare opportunity to record this type of data from human olfactory and limbic structures\nAnd if it falls faction and memory or related you see people with memory problems also having issues with smell [noise]\nAh that that's a really good point um a lot of neurodegenerative diseases actually do present with early olfactory decline um\nAnd well I think are these findings that we're discussing or may not have direct implications for neurodegenerative disease I think um [noise]\nThe impact of of breathing on limbic activity certainly suggests potential new avenues and directions of research on on these diseases um for example it you know it'd be interesting to know if these mechanisms may be altered in nerd degenerative disease um and I I also think\nThat our data point to the possibility that neurodegenerative disease could result in all altered nasal breathing patterns I'm breathing is so easy to measure\nAnd this is something that we're looking into and in the lab so do um patience with different neurological disorders do they breathe differently do they have characteristic nasal breathing patterns\nAnd sort of something or you're going to be following up we're right yes under any mirror degenerative disease in particular\nUh we're we're currently collecting breathing data from patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with Parkinson's disease to see if we can differentiate the two um states just by analyzing the shapes of their breathing wave forums\nOr were the only thing I'm going to just throw to talk of some really dumb [laughter]\n... they're breathing wave forums\nOr were the only I'm going to just throw this is talk of some really dumb [laughter] are I mean\nWhy do we need to breathe through our mouths if we have our noses and are we the only animals are breathing through our mouth\nYeah you know I I really I think are sort of like a great question and I spent a lot of time thinking about that actually I\nI mean I think the answer probably goes far beyond just the sort of immediate thought which is that if your nose is congested you have this alternate breathing route so that you can still get Erin and still live in one that was bite off and on one um\nBut we're finding that it really drastically changes our brain activity so I think that the full answer to that question really remains to be seen and I think it's a really interesting point I Know that um well most mammals that that I can think of do\nPant and parenting is is typically something that involves mouth breathing so dogs pant not only when they're hot but I think also when they're stressed uh cats as well and I think that's um something interesting about that\nSupport for Kagan ... comes from Prescott living magazine the fall of the nation is now

will uncover but I don't think it'll be flourish in just for the sake of exploration I think it'll be more of the fact that it\nAllows us to see things\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nJust haven't been able to until now\nMm that's actor Ryan Gosling playing astronaut Neil Armstrong and the new movie first man he's talking about why he wants to be part of the Gemini missions astronaut crew which will later on down the lands in the first human does that food and set foot on the surface of the moon and\nWe've gathered a solar panel of space nerds to talk about the film what they liked and maybe could have been done a little bit differently abled and there were some areas in the film we want to hear from you if you if you could make a movie about space exploration\nWhat story would you want to town and is it a common stories we hear the famous ones\nWhat about some on famous people and famous stories that\nThat could be from the space race or right now at any decade your

you don't know that much [laughter] we'll get we're going to be giving that away so if you want to take part in a number eight full force having to for eight to five five or you can also reach us at science friday I'm very much to let's start with the review thumbs up or thumbs down\nOh I loved it you'll hang up I'm In the tank for this movie I really liked first man at actually I said that's a kind of surpassed my previous favorites based movie a and is now in the top spot above Apollo Thirteen\nRarely yeah pretty I pray yeah I really I really enjoyed it I thought that it was sort of the space movie that uh that we needed\nIn a lot of ways why what do you mean we needed Garfield good movies [laughter] and not so much more uh I really enjoy the tone of it like I I have wanted for a long time a for there to be some kind of darker look at space history and I think that this kind of\nGave it to us in a lot of different ways from like the ... metal of the ship to a lesser launching lately I was\nYou know I was wondering if it was you know I and I moved in can as it was ... you know get an idea how the rattling I'm which vibration\n... ... I was you know I was ... he was\nYou know I and I mean can as it was ... you know get an idea how the rattling much vibration really was in their\n... like ... I felt that um and just also like looking at the portrayal of masculinity and kind of the way that the whole movie came together around that I thought was a really astute in a lot of waste ... what did you think\nOn a personal level I really enjoyed it for me it's the first person aspect versus just sort of watching it from the outside you can really put yourself in the movie and you know most of us will never get to fly in space so getting to actually experience it in a way I was really fun way to have a movie made\nMhm I sent for throughout the film we see Neal Armstrong as a dispassionate mhm reserved contained and that was all part of his engineering mindset here's an here's a clip\nPlanning on taking some jewelry to the new buzz sure what what fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal when you take anything a better choice I think we're\nI think that's a real quote of is you you ... you know right I did I did I met him once I'm\nAt a conference I think you know the movie it really does justices character in a way and I like the movie quite a bit it's a it's a flood movie but it's really great movie I really think this is a a movie that captures the other side of the right stuff so to speak the engineering technical backgrounds and the kind of commitment these guys needed to have beyond just be fighter drugs and\nAnd that kind of internal narrative internal uh I'm kind of story in this movie about what it took to be an astronaut\nI think we do is communicated really effective was he as reserved as you went as you knew him well I didn't really I don't think I knew that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I think as perhaps a dour as portrayed in the movie\nOr you had a sense of humor he was a funny guy uh but I Do think he had\nReserve but he was not I think as perhaps a dour as portrayed in the movie or you had a sense of humor he was a funny guy uh but I Do think he had a lot of struggles in his life and as his biographer Jim Hansen has talked about uh [noise]\nUm you know there were some serious problems struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues announced runoff so you know I think it's a bit of both he was I think he was he was a bit um perhaps reticent but um but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out\n[laughter] you know you didn't get that impression too much\nIn the movie not so much in the movie but I think the movie was focused on those aspects of his career in life than required concentration delusions\nYeah and there's your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like there was a fair portrayal of any engineer\nI think engineers have a whole variety of personality so I think he saw a few different personalities that movie and if you look across a lot of movies you see that their son engineer there's a very serious one they're the ones that are super outgoing so it's certainly a fair perfect portrayal because pretty much every personality type exists in engineering\nAnd one thing that struck me about this film was how jarring and difficult Paul the scenes of space flight were there you had a Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and it was just disorienting any time we saw people flying ... news you'd was that realistic to you\nI think there was a lot of realistic aspects that you know people assume you have this\nFund floating feeling but especially in the Gemini capsule the mercury there wasn't a lot of room that you were really crammed in there the cockpit right in your face the control panel so I think that with a very accurate portrayal ... all the switches engages are just right there so that and then of course the rocket ride up till can be um very bumpy so that was certainly true\nLet's go to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday\nOh hi Hi Saturday I think I got disconnect\nTrue that's got to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday\nOh hi Hi Saturday I think I got disconnected there for a moment um yeah I was saying it just since you happened to mention the program we hear a lot about mercury and we hear a lot about a but Apollo but I feel like the Gemini program is under served the first time\nMan stepped out into the void and Americans that space walks I think that's a story worth telling\nHey thanks for that call and you know I have a lot of people don't realize you know in that scene in the movie where he can control the orbiting the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got the first seat you know to go landing on the ...\nYeah I think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of um [noise] made it much more visible and they asked for an office there were I mean there were other candidates for the job but for sure the gym and I ate experience was a really key point I was a really dangerous mission\nAnd that was just looking at all life magazines from that month and it was widely reported that the time as a kind of really kind of a an amazing exciting moment in the space race\nA kind of success or failure in that sense but a fantastic a moment captured really nicely in the movie\nAs the one person in the room who remembers that real in real time I can say that it was very very concerning um uh the the big emotional punch of the story was Neal's grief over the death of his daughter when she was just two years old\nAnd then the last so the fellow astronaut and lead up to Apollo you know Lebanon Apollo one whatever and you think these humans just lost his shaped history has has played out a\nI you know I mean these things or if I I think is also communicate in the movie the fighter pilots test pilots were very familiar with losses 'cause they had been at um air force bases and there's many of their colleagues were um you know not making it back home from test flights\nMiller with losses because they had been um air force bases and they're many of their colleagues were um you know not making it back home from test flight so in in many ways they were used to it but nobody's really used to losses like that and especially losing a child is something that nobody can really knowing this happened to them\nFunding for gay and a new comes from the museum of northern Arizona announcing his it a skateboard

I Believe was some kind of Netflix series about about them also some kind of documentary series that was or regard as you know\n... and all the people who were in control\nTheories about about that and also some kind of documentary series that was regarded\nYeah ... and all the people who were in the control room and all the other places and you know\nAll kinds of all kinds of stories\nUm it's interesting ah this this is the movie um about the heroes of astronaut certainly fifty years ago\nAnd it will be fifty\nYears since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter] and we also have Apollo Thirteen we have the right stuff\nWhy is Hollywood still talking about things that happen fifty years ago when so much has happened since what do you think yeah I mean that's a good question I I think part of it is that\nYou know Apollo landing on the moon that was that was the big stuff like that was the big stuff that human exploration has has done\nIn the last fifty years I mean that the shuttle is exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting and incredible as like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep wells that people keep coming back to you because of that\nUh and that is that like I think that there are plenty of stories to be told more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots should should get there do\nYou know that's what I mean we were talking about this I said they're all those robots we don't hear any stories about the trials and tribulations getting those robots yeah and they're ... and other places yeah and you know what we also hear about any stories of any other countries in the space for ... there are so many other asks if there are so many countries up there\nRight now I mean there is a story to be told that the tweet about the Russians I think there'll be a an epic story to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're all they're travails and difficulties and the space dog like a ... there's many ways to make her into that story\nUh they're they're older travails and difficulties and\nThe space dog like um there's many ways to enter into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those are sort of maybe imagining a kind of alternate alternative to these sort of looking backward movies I think\nMaybe there is something to be said about the interest in space in general but I like to believe we're not just looking back rules with imagine in the future\nIs your what are they talking about a NASA these days about\nAh so what what are big project is actually trying to get back to the moon so that's a bigger Ryan is the last programs and all of exploration systems ballot meant so\nYou know really I think once we can start flying those flights are there will be a whole nother a crop of a story to be told and one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering and how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could figure out how to tell\nWhat it takes to actually get to the flight ... the astronaut to fly on it mhm bend in Mesa, Arizona welcome to science friday\n... thank thank you my name's Ben and uh yeah I Would I Would think it'd be interesting to make a film about what the challenger accident from an engineering standpoint um they the engineers actually tried to stop the launching a and unfortunately that did not happen\nUm and it and then in the end it affected them in ways that many people did though of course it expects it killed the crew but oh I think that many of the of the engineers have a story to tell us well\nThat's a good point yeah absolutely I mean that's a ... that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is a plan to make a movie about the challenger mission um but focused on the school teacher ...\nThe story but um I I think there is a ... plan to make a movie about the challenger mission um but focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nThe decisions made or the day and the ... the day before the launch which were critical will be depicted in some fashion in the movie which were all engineering decisions and uh I'm I'm and I'm sure it will be you know a crucial to understanding the accident Mm\nUh you know you mentioned the Orion mission that wants to get us back to the moon is is it going to be easier because of the lessons we learned from Paul\nIn order to know uh getting to the moon is just as hard today as it was in the Nineteen sixties I mean we know a little bit more and we have an experience space of one draw from a but actually going to the moon mission is going to be justice risky it's\nJust it's hard to do um that amount of a prop we need when Neal said he wished for more ... I Wish for more prop every day as well um so it's not any easier getting to the moon and it is risky I'm the second time around\nI remember after the ... the Apollo missions were cancelled there were three rockets leftover we only went to Seventeen years was to be twenty I remember going to Houston and seeing them lying on their side one lying inside as a home for nesting birds and everyone thought there was anything as sad as seeing a Saturn five being home for you know it's nice to birds at a\nPlace in an effort who's the most ... it's in a building now and it's been restored I I mean I I Know that has been couldn't we just turn that's put back in the family building and send them back to the moon is I mean\nI feel that the avionics are quite out of date at that point I don't think we can control it anymore [laughter]\nWhen what's the schedule for that and do we have enough money and is it going to be going\nSo we're working to uh twenty twenty flight for the first launch of the last ah and really the second lots of uh Ryan we launched in twenty fourteen for the first flight of a riot\nSo we're working to uh twenty twenty flight for the first launch of SOS a and really the second lots of uh Ryan we launched in twenty four came for the first flight of her eye on 'em and that'll be an unproven flight we are going around the moon or to a different retrograde orbits would leave and go way past and they went about Seventy thousand kilometers on the far side\nAnd that will be a long mission that's really a shakedown all of the vehicle systems on ... and the Ryan before we put crew out in the next flight we were in progress we have enough money um and it's just a challenge getting their back to the future\nYes said we do that or I Want to thank all of you are for ... for taking time to be with us and it's\nIt's gonna be the fifth anniversary next year it's really amazing\nAnd we'll all be looking forward", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "26", "locations": [["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Iran", 32.0, 53.0], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Montenegro", 42.75, 19.25], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Jordan", 31.0, 36.0], ["Amman", 31.95522, 35.94503], ["Obama", 17.04483, -61.86117], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Zach", -40.84826, 173.77018], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Leeds", 53.79648, -1.54785], ["England", 44.0, -71.0], ["India", 22.0, 79.0], ["India", 22.0, 79.0], ["Bollywood", 15.27642, 73.91271], ["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0], ["India", 22.0, 79.0], ["India", 22.0, 79.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Tibet", 31.66667, 88.0], ["Oregon", 44.00013, -120.50139], ["Kagan", 55.9664, 60.539], ["Prescott", 34.54002, -112.4685], ["Prescott", 34.54002, -112.4685], ["Prescott Arizona", 34.54002, -112.4685], ["Oregon", 44.00013, -120.50139], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["US", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Istanbul", 41.01384, 28.94966], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Cambridge", 52.2, 0.11667], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Prescott", 34.54002, -112.4685], ["Nashville", 36.16589, -86.78444], ["Nashville", 36.16589, -86.78444], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Sarasota Florida", 27.33643, -82.53065], ["Sarasota Florida", 27.33643, -82.53065], ["Lebanon", 33.83333, 35.83333], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["M.

the Nobel Prize in chemistry um [noise] ... you know a lot of people think you're a scientist but you were very proud of engineer are you not\nI Am tell us what the differences well I Love\nTo build things and I can make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules so we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new proteins\nHow do you build that I was watching it to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\nWhat the differences well I Love to build things I'd like to make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules so we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new proteins\nHow do you build that I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] yeah it's it's really amazing has changed so much and the thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type out a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story and we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou you're saying that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nActually it's easy to write and you know DNA what's hard is composing it you'd think about it DNA is the code of life it's the product of almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edited but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of of a complex biological function that didn't exist before\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose\nWe don't understand how DNA encodes function remember biology molecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesize DNA and put it in a test tube I can go direct the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product that I'm that what's the next step [noise]\nSo you put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it as if it were their own and are they in they then take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA encodes\nThan I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide who is better than what I started with\nWhich one of those microbes makes a bitter protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry so are you um take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIt is it's sort of creating life in that cell is a new you're creating a new form of life or you're not [noise]\nWell I think that's probably exaggerating because life was there for me to work with were using the tools of biology to make new things I'm making new proteins they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells but\nYou do you need the cell to help you make the ... [noise]\nWell actually so you don't have to have the cell there is now very powerful systems where he can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test to with no cells at all\n... and so uh where do you rent truly see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human\nTeams they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells\nBut you do you need the cell to help you make the ... [noise]\nWell actually so [noise] you don't have to have the self there's now very powerful systems where he can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test tube with no cells at all\n... and so uh where do you bring to really see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power of biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make\nTherapeutic agents and an end pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess waste\n... I saw on you talked to said I have fun for us we molecules to have sex\nOh yes [laughter] I Do [laughter] [laughter] well if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would devise such a a a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else\nAnd that benefit is the innovation that comes around\nIf you we combined DNA you get progeny\nRe combined DNA dieting coach something novel\n... she would get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to ... Adrian and Hamdan I imagine\nThere who are gone and hand on um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where my parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering my son who\nYour DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around if you read combined DNA you get progeny we combined DNA betting coach something novel\n... she would get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to an Adrian and Hamdan I Adrian\nHi this is a non and hand that um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where my parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering my son who is about two and a half years old\nWhat I'm trying to figure out how to identify his mind said whether it be towards chemistry sports um math so may not be completely irrelevant question but I Would love to hear your thoughts on this subject how to identify your kids\nOr younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science physics\n[noise] did you know did you know what an early age that colonel that you want to go I I\nI was lucky my father was a nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls could do math just as well as boys could so he never discourage me and I also had four brothers to compete with\nAnd I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model a mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept them or you know kept alive ... encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\n... I'm a ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify\nEncouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept them or kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\nMhm I'm a ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age was talented in science\nI think all children are talented and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage someone ...\nHave a tweet from Sydney who says\nPlease ask what she knows about how instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urge to bury things\n[laughter] I Wish

what the genetic details of that are as we sequence more things and under ... and measure their properties will be using important and powerful tools like machine learning to peace out and to try to

change your mind about something some some listeners are phoning in and first one Alex's from Chicago hey Olin neighbor\n[noise] hey Sallie they're either in go ahead so odd\nBy previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nHow it's as a black male\nYou know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist systems that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicide journalistic systems unknowingly\nWasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to to identify as feminists um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist systems and so I'm being able to see the fact that you know I can still be a male male experiences while existing ...\nI'm In identifying myself in such a way it really changed my mind\nI'm In the thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nHe's he's you know as part of the problems that we don't see how we are there see yes\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we often spend cheat on trying to defend our end points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed that he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nI thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nIs you know as part of the problem was that we don't see how we others see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we often spend you know trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed that he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the call has experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analogous experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions doe requirement he requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect and their their view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way pauses math\nThese things have poorest boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects the bureaucratic purposes but I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me\nWith logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use loaded whether they're a mathematician or not\nWe'll talk about some some er current events or let's turn out to the artist topic and current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe accusation\nTwin subjects the bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician\nIn order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not\nWe'll talk about some some of the current events or it's turned out to the oddest topic and current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault a good show a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether that should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process as at plagues tell me what you mean by that\nThat's a whole other our whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because most of the people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence and the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for saying certain things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence\nThere is a paradox because some people say well we have to presume ... someone innocence until that until that proved guilty and the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused Boston or let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the man I'm the woman both innocent at the same time because that ...\nJust about whether you can be in prison for saying certain things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence\nThere is a paradox because some people say well we have to presume ... someone innocence until that until that proved guilty\nAnd the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused Boston or let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a paradox because we can't actually hold the man I'm the woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and civil Sufi have studied paradoxes for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look up ... will that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time and it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that world and good what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation\nAnd and if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen I'm happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so\nHaving a false accusation um would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but ... isn't proved to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have some help prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo and then ... them is a a question of black and white thinking\nAnd this happens a lot where people get into arguments in extremes on so many of our arguments at the moment ton divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between I'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you\nAre making everyone into a rapist or watch one that professor land but said on his book that that we are ... just spin the bottle crimes as rape and that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment right\nPeople get into arguments in extremes on so many of our arguments at the moment on divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between\nI'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you are making everyone into a rapist or ... one that professor lung but said on his book that that we are ... just spin the bottle crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things that are as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is and straw puffing arguments where you can take that false equivalence and then you can declare it while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind just by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\nAnd finally um that's the question of knowledge and alternate hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing law where you have to decide what you'll default position is and then to say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind\n[noise] in the Nineteen hundreds the ingredient

off instruments like Kepler and the Newark test had been racking up the planet count but this week astronomers writing in the journal science advances\nBrought the whole thing to a new level describing the possible discovery not have an exoplanet but at the moon orbiting an exoplanet to be specific\nKepler sixteen dashed twenty five ... be and his some four thousand light years away has to do that well joining me now to talk about the research is Alex T cheese and antiseptic graduate research fellow and the department of astronomy right here in New York at Columbia University welcome to science friday\nThank you very much for having me first what what moon is this where it give us a little thumbnail description sure yeah so\nIt's a a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainty but as far as we can tell it's there are a large moon about the size of Neptune actually which is sort of strange um orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five be and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can do\nSo but so what is the relationship with the size of the moon to the size of the plants\nSo the size of the planet is ah about the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell a and then the moon is uh like I say about the size and the mass of net\nBut even at a pretty unusual well known that big well it certainly unexpected right where if\nThe moon's in our solar system ah we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than the earth so uh when we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune that are sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little prima ...\nThe size of the planet is ah by the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell\nA and then the moon is uh like I say about the size and the mass of net but even at a pretty unusual well known that big a well it's certainly unexpected right where if you look at the moon's in our solar system ah we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than New York so\nUh when we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune\nThat are sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this is potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nAh but ah you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it is so large a it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see is so large\nYou know because we think of our moon we think of another body hitting earth and knocking out a peace it doesn't look like that in this case uh yeah\nIt's funny you know there's so there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact or scenario like how we got earth's moon ah moons coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planet in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally a capture scenario like a Neptune largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ...\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but that detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nYeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for\nScenario like a Neptune largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ... [noise] so uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but that detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nSure yeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the store like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks on some of the light as well in addition to that uh we try to see the gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet\nAnd so that makes the planet ... around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so sometimes that planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late\nAnd so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on the planet that uh that uh we're attributing to them\nHey ... and that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they doubt well so\nIt's an extraordinary claim and as the famous thing goes next door now claiming is ah one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thoroughly\nNot just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on this planet that uh that uh we're attributing to them\nHey ... you know and that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they say out loud\nSo it's an extraordinary claim him as the famous thing goes extraordinary claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job trying to\nRule out other possible explanations for this signal a question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planted in the system that's that's pulling on this planet and making in wobble around\nA those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a an incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible it's not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm it\nWell it was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this that you write very hard to get so you must have been other people might want to know about this very sure yeah yeah you\nSo we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event uh we observe this system for about forty hours altogether so if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't UBS\nThe other people might want to know about\nThis very sure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event uh we observe this system for about forty hours altogether so if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope uh from the surface of the earth\nSo you'd have to stitched together multiple datasets from multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that uh that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the wants to ... is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it should be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope is that right ... a better for you guys were looking an extra point\nGoing to be like why yeah if it had been spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror a and a sitting aware as Hubble orbits the earth\nOr when we perform this observation you know you can imagine how people staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single urban ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out a James jaded just he won't have that problem\nAnd like I say the mere is going to be really spectacular so uh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah uh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly for the times Oregon\nStaring at this target but then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out a James jaded just he won't have that problem and like I say the mere is going to be really spectacular so\nUh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah uh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly afford the time so we're going to have to have a very good case\nYou know there are downsides officer there isn't\nA matter of obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else I think so long ago as well I mean we shouldn't made it twice as big we've spent whatever and I'm sure yeah you\nKnow so there's other telescopes coming down the pike that there are people bidding right now to well that we've talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called ... more than ... ... yeah that's a\nAh I I don't know who's working on it but it's it's a ultraviolet and read and optical that's L. O. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so uh that they come up with great names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instrument stadium Estee will definitely be an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it ...\nIt is All right so if this is a strange jar planted situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nA great question and one of the things that I Am always saying to people is you know they always come with the question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things and uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems we are learning\nBoys over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it really amazing\nIt is All right so if this is a strange ... planet situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nThat's a great question and one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems we are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here\nThinks we're listening to you know you Arizona Public radio

is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be the topic of her new book\nTo poison squad one came a single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five I'm let's turn that the the clock back\nTo that time period Deborah or you have an entire chapter on ketchup\n[laughter] what was going into that ... why devoted well I read and I know why or why devote the tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch up [noise]\nSo this is it gets it it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have\nThis is a catch up it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea scrawny first century idea of catch up which is you know kind of a sick tomato based kind of a but\nIn the nineteenth again at tended to be a kind of thin nasty a sauce with a lot of vegetable ways in it people would put pumpkin ... people would put tomatoes that they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called Tara dies and then because of the whole mess of it\nTended to kind of be rotten anyway they dumped preservatives and it like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and so this ... because of this kind of battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair\nAnd in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes a point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J lines of ah the Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives out of his ... his products the reinvented catch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz\nAnd he did it so there was a lot of tomato and I said that kept the bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government\nAnd Heinz although he was a big believer and profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent his or some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nThe things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives\nThat kept the bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government\nAnd Heinz although he was a big believer in profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent his or some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nThe things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives\nI Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that\nPlus you know there was major combat over the preservatives and get er and that was pretty fascinating but\nLet's talk about a Harvey Washington where I was a little bit more than ... the focus of your book and the partisan squad um he actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes food safety ever tell us about that what is one of the ... yeah it was amazing it's just\nCrazy and you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really since we're about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know at\nCompletely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animal safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things in the human beings\nAnd so that's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerous Lee and the deal was they would eat\nLabels you know at completely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animal safety testing at all I'm just going to dump these things into human beings and so\nThat's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerously and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time had to be adding capsules\nOf the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low to very hot\nAnd so during the poison ... squad experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food\nHe looked at bore acts which is a cleaning product he looked at ... which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you were food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivates\nStarted having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems and because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you were food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hymns wanted you know create this poisonous ... gets to the bottom of the food safety\nYou know that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller cameras spray he his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also night ten or a preacher\nConductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nAnd he had imbued his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling\nAnd and ... really I mean what was interesting about him was that he took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in from the very beginning and then he just starts feeling at a party spilling the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk people are the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government [noise] hang on ...\n[laughter] they can take a drink of water that are there you go [noise] um\nHe has this very early sense of the ...\nFor the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government [noise] hang on travel golf\n[laughter] they can take a drink of water that are [laughter] there you go um\nHe has this very early sense of the role of the government when we say in the constitution promote the general welfare this is kinda how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare and your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually did that's the thing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person\nWho drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation on our way we think about food safety\nSo did he actually we're in we're in our laws created because of his crusade where the Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can be angry\nI Am so after you know he's like battling away stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed then one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug active Nineteen oh six passed a somewhat carried by that kind of tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nTeeth and the FDA and things like that can be angry\nI Am so after you know he's like battling away stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed and one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug act of Nineteen oh six past somewhat carried by that kind of tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was an and I we've forgotten this but that was the first great consumer protection law\nEver pass by the federal government and so it was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm\nAnd to stand up in that way if you asked why he would say\nOkay that was a star but the law was immediately weakened by business interactions which it was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "05", "locations": [["Iran", 32.0, 53.0], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098],

back right Joe thanks for having me Ira\nAnything more about what went wrong there\nYet so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure\nAnd they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic landing ballistic descent which is so called because usually they add make kind of added a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of left and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rock literally coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because ah they were supposed to come back down to the ground and the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an

areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know in tire early what they were trying to do this for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um a lot of conversation about Russian interference\nThe third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and

I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or where the hackers compromising and why were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know in tire early what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is a tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns\nAnd their emails those are those are two separate things ah if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases or the roles that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which uh manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think\nUm we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWhat was that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there is that something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um\nThat um it looks like at least one election systems vendor which uh manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think um we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWas that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there is that something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems might actually I think they may still [laughter] they may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them\nUm and again they manufacture pull books and and deal with registration databases\nOr electronic publics or what you can kind of what our use their off in a a tablets or art or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said I last I checked and I think they have they they may have denied that they were actually successfully breached but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome dinner and it sounded like them uh that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised [noise] well\n[noise] ah well that's actually quite a controversial question him ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped\nUm I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um you know perhaps to influence the the elections ranging from\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um if we're asking about um\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromise well\nI'm a well that's actually quite a controversial\nQuestion if you ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um\nYou know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from um affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems um in the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which um where he was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nPotentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and\nIf we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to that Khan um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the um what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines\nTo the DEF CON\nUm activities and so what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines\nUm require such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them\nUm and you need some sort of inside job um that would require 'em a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing is it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nOur they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go\nWith one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using like\nThen the election officials do our they right\nUm well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't have any sort of paper record of the election\nBeing there in that position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing that um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could\nI think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes in the programming so um so I I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of\nThinking that the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the state's the moving directions to make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI I could just jump in real quick point um I I I I I think there to to build on on what Charles just said uh I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about um\nKeener well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the state's the

somebody reaching them in various ways but but um [noise] more importantly there's there there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nAnd yet she is fluent in squirrel monkey and it's all on science friday from WNYC Studios [noise]\nAnother hour of science

for seven to four to five five eight four four seven to four to five\nFive you can also tweet us at science friday I'm\nSo Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree in Greece in average global temperatures but this report tells us but even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big changes [noise]\nYeah that's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and that was because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd good for example\nSo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming if you think about um\nNot on track 'em and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference in ... for example\nSo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse\nWith two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer on when you don't have any ice on on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further\nBecause you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses um two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects\nI'm almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most um devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent ah which is just trawling\nPush to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects I'm almost forty percent worse uh under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most um devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent ah which is just tremendous\nYou know does it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the river to orange or degrees\nSo what the report finds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on\nThere have been a lot of modeling studies were analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happened on right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net emissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the combination rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand increasing the efficiency of\nAnd then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the composition rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity\nOr to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand increasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nUm a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them do we need\nA you know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can can you answer at least who commission did what they do they use\nSure so on the way that the IPC she works um is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists\nUm had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says\nI'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea um about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually\nBeing um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case on there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policy makers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\n[noise] ah we're a lot of people want to talk about what I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice\n[noise] yes hello so I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up confusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it what really hurts us\nIn agriculture is the high temperature the record highs so for example in the Midwest is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to yield are in the Central Valley of California one tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this was really critical of the are the highs not just the average temperatures and fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north American forest grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the to the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more the scientist will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables\nTomatoes when the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this is really critical of the are the highs not just the average temperatures and

started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in so off I went\nIt's friday I think it's great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my childhood as one of the first animals and went into space wow what got you fascinated with study scores so\nI'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in\nSo off I went to um Amazon and Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them\nAnd I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [noise] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow I'm a big show how many do you study how many of the group a number of your study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd I do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them\nSquirm one of the challenges of working with squirrel monkey to that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they move quite fast they're pretty active so it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are\nSo I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd I do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them some\n... square one of the challenges of working with squirrel monkey to that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they move quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them a particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise]\nOkay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh they spend a lot of time active all day they they're nonstop\nOr they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\n... for their practice or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper yes\nSo grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshopper sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nOn you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\n... for their practice or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd a with a head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes\nAnd they seem very happy while they're doing it wow\n[laughter] and I understand they're not afraid to attack a ... a wasp mess right why don't why haven't they do that yeah so\nI've only seen adults do it but I've actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nuts that Hank pretty low and once the adult lost desert the nest\nThe adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nWow for their pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient and patient [laughter] those watch for not leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's\nOf ... of of of of the other one of the spider monkey let's let's hear that clip\n\nDesert the nest the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient inpatient [laughter] it was once we're not leaving so right yeah I've done this myself problem we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of ... of of of the other one of the spider ... let's let's hear that clip\n[noise] I\n... I said spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us when we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I didn't recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver yeah um but when there's you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there\nHard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that and it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that that's the sad that we hear is that right there there's usually this is those squirrel monkeys and we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because squirrel monkey sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys instead of\nBird and how hard was it how much time has it taken you to know the difference and to study this sounds to me\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and knows everything about square monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nAnd how long have you been doing that for a little longer he started with with uh\nBut just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys um you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey was for her and she knows everything

forging grounds ...\nAnd and they usually actually these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate upstream have to find the right stream to go how does he do this and they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\nThis ah same and have a diverse\nArray of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reached streams uh they generally would use their sense of smell but in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and magnetic information\n... now I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon be lapped exam and what what makes them so interesting to you\nThis is rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants\nOf individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake\nIn Maine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\nAnd yet you found that they still have these Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed that they not been ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nAn interesting question a so CNN when they use\nYears ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\nAnd yet you round but they still have these Jew magnetic maps and that they would have needed that they knocked ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use different aspects of the magnetic field especially for maps and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field\nOr also known as my dad field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator another aspect\nOf the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth\nAnd so they're steeper toward the polls and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict are favorably are predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel so they form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them\nThey're the mechanisms behind Meg NATO reception are are still unclear but one of the leading hypotheses is that a salmon and other species have tiny chains of\nThe intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel so they form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them so\nThey're the mechanisms behind Meg NATO reception are are still unclear but one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species\nHave tiny chains of magna tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property ... and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that the change can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strengths and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nSo these made ... structures are thought to be found in the nose\nAnd also the latter alliance all along the sides of the body of a fish\nBut the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nAnd worry winds may be important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these\nWell it's a rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that could go to the ocean retain a map sense just to point of curiosity and we also wanted to know um if it lent examine\nAlso possess disability it's another group of individuals that\nDoes ethnic maps and a lot of diverse amount not amounts of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic\nOne can they even detect a magnetic field\nTo know whether landlocked numbers of species that could\nGo to the ocean retain a map sense just to a point of curiosity\nAnd we also wanted to know um if it Lennox\nSalmon also possesses ability it's another group of individuals that does ethnic maps of diverse and not know amounts of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic\nEnvironments one can they even detect the magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how did they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing research\nSo the eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon and were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were rewritten subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coil and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire and when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply\nAnd crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nIs a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us to\nAlter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\n... so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know great schools and if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnum pi the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to assure you magnify them shutting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\n... is that allows us to\nAlter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\n... so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know in grade school of if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnetized the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the fish or you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf that were present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains\nOf NATO type right that somehow connect with an herself right and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement ... by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos of our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fishes head relative to magnetic north\nThat's terrific and and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer course scale to maintain a resolution of those ...\n... so what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment\nTo have to magnetic north\nThat's terrific and and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how

number of C sections happening all over the world listen to this to worldwide rate has nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section now\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick what are the effects on mothers and babies\nAnd what into vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner you get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nYou can tweet us at ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy is an author author on that a Lancet series he's also professor of midwife midwifery\nAt the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining it to the alley Kennedy\nThank you uh tell us the Lancet series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rates can you give us some of the ...\nAh tell us alliances series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have buried around the world\n[noise] well it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries overuse C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous his um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... and about right so when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and we're way\nWas talking about over ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in\nFor example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's um it's an accepted norm of this part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the problems [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... says area and is not a low risk um surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states who are increasing maternal mortality rate\n... you mentioned that the in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and\nThey're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when a woman really needs it and I think it's important to stay in at the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it's\nI think it's important to to stay in the ... there are women who and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI Want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr going thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um\n... there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the do the do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen this in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... in the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver on in our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise in there and delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and\n[noise] yeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make the recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day um\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make a recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nUm it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress string labor in terms of the cervical dial Asian I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on only Brent delivery unit that might put some pressure on us to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nAnd a highly what's your reaction to\nAll I Would completely agree with her the the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having ... birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to ... per\nA in her physiology two two best achieved ... birth\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Lauren welcome to science friday\nIra thank you You're welcome good\nI actually had an emergency thirty why leave 'em and I think for that for that but when I got pregnant that time\nFor that for that they'll hold me um but when I got pregnant for a second time I really wasn't given the option of having ... after the section [noise]\nUm I kinda had to do all of that um education investigation on so I had to look at what they had to look at rates and what were the risks very and maybe you took pregnancy and um it really was up to me it was um like my provider\nAll that you want to have a repeat of the time I was like oh\nSure I'll have a repeat that 'cause I didn't but I wasn't given the risks and benefits of those that to be able to make a truly educated\nDecision um and so I think that um

R. G.\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increase in the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr highly Kennedy professor of mid were free at the Yale School of nursing director Tony going vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and though lots lots of folks on on the line let's see we only uh gosh can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach there compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it deters in several ways and actually when the land is slanted series on C. section came out that Debbie World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help on us look at decreasing says ... and and one of the things that they had recommended\nSo issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says Erin's and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have\nA collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that ... was a a sociology with improved outcomes increasing including decreasing C sections until one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of mid we're free across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest sea section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent adverse are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent adverse are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that with outcomes and uh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it as an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty\nRespected um you have better outcomes\nOh Tony go when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing it for a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\nWell first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says area and a first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are and labor\nThat kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really try to make sure that people were using scientific modern definitions for progress in labor\nA old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really proved to us we want it to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiasm for ... back and then also some other operate\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiastic for be back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke here at the Beth Israel and I said you if you were only from so blown down here in Boston and so does this all mean that a fair to the hospital you go to determines more or less if you'll have a C section or not\nUnfortunately it does a and so I one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on Syrian delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there an delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr we have a tweeter vets relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that in your your your report Holly\nWill or not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really\nUm level that playing field in in any in addition to liability reform um many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but\nTo liability reform um mini in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one in in time or perceived to be in time [noise]\nMhm ... you're you're ... the main issue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the U.S a where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery than necessary and delivery however the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients I'm and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S a reimbursement is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length of stay let's go to Sharon in Somerville mass harsher\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications from Crohn's disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that kind of as questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know pushed the baby out ...\nAnd and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academics\nTwo beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections are not available to me and I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute or Tony are only would I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that\nYou have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... birth to Syrian or fully ... fully discuss I'm Antonia what about this the charge of sexism here\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how a baby is born\nI'm the person who gives birth to the baby becomes a parent's uh after that happens on its know lesser no more ... regardless of what the motives delivery ... delivery on certainly makes you just as much as the mother on as having a vegetable every\nSupport for gay and

they are in their own vital parts of our ecosystem weather is food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior I think about the term hive mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world\nBut how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful and can individual behavior still pills the hand of fate for the whole group\nOr the hives indeed the legion my next guest looked at these questions how his word is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumblebees and know a pitcher woman is an associate professor at UCLA\nLooking at these social behavior of these ants and even spider [noise]\n\nSecond what did you know I if you ask everybody you they'll tell you that honeybees get all the attention right now but you gravitated to bumble bee why was\nMy did my PHD in a honeybee lab\nAnd then I went round and worked on bumblebees instead I started a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit\nThese instead I started a PHD in two thousand six which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit that we could use to answer all kinds of really cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to only these bumblebees have a very different like circle right out of the colonies gets dark\nFirst honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social um there's never a point in their lives in the life of a hobby queen\nOr she's living on her own bumblebees are different um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and these queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring I these queens have to crawl out of there over wintering spot and start their own nests so they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though there are social insects and they have queens and workers\nAnd the sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to\nBroadway show us with ...\nI did yeah you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor was social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest away that they live\nTo patrol Ming a meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we tend to confuse the two kinds of bees was having equals lifestyles all the time\nDream we social all the time right yes they are and we turned to confuse the two kinds of bees was having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees is a ... and swings my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focused and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals in the colony contribute to forging ... home\nYou're brought from ants were too jarring Jarvis\nHarvest France from I'm here in California oh it's like for partially on the sidewalk ... slightly larger than what we are a little bit longer there but yeah and they score sheet and the ones you see on the sidewalk and ... why are you interested in the cities\nArea and the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between nest sites\nSo a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they for it and how quickly they call their friends to food so another thing I brought here as a cast ... flip it over I was on its head\nOh so it was like that that's a cast of a an ad Smith yes you is that like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly fast their players from Home Depot how far does that go down and just the whole life I Know that's just the top part\nAbout six or eight inches long it looks from just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nSo you can pour down other materials we did one ... um which is a type of metal that when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's heartening that's easier to dig around and it won't break like the plaster and so we can see that it's ...\nThat's like water and sewage slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to dig around and break the plaster and so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he's the these there's a lot of ... that determines how they can go\nTo our house there's so much focus on queen bumble bee what about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones so that the Germans don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's important to point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this and we are those really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other search trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point uh but we think that there are probably also factors in regard to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nInteresting lots of questions from the audience let's start right or were there on the right side yes go ahead please\n... and people just haven't looked for them yet well interesting lots of questions from your own and foot start right or were there on the right side yes go ahead please\nUm my um my mom is\nAllergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to 'em\nLike helped her heal her when she gets style that is a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack that up first or do you work with ... and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies um that's\nA really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the terrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were somebody being me to\nUm those a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the victim and the B interact\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question uh no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen Howard their lives different from something like a honeybee\nThere's a lot of species and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities and differences in first of all many of them live underground ... will and\nPut their hives and say the same three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example the honeybees in some species offense will relocate from one to say to another so honeybees will\nGo and look for a new nest site and can the way the shape of the entrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ants will off there's a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places are there some somebody's in some differences I think the\nAnd that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places are there are some similarities in some

Paul associate professor of integrative biology\nOne of these genes in a surprising place nowhere near the brain welcome back to ... Paul associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles [noise]\n\nIs that right you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is yes\nFor um the majority of long term studies that have looked have found that if you get significantly less or significantly more than seven to a point five hours a night than that doesn't work out well for you in\nTime in a lot of trouble yeah 'cause I get like six if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell that is not going to end in all honesty I'm In a six hour crowd myself why do we need to sleep and the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what we do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first are where we can sort of short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just made me up with the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow\nYour memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue Bailey on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at a higher risk\nBasis not getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at a higher risk for infectious diseases and it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke and diabetes\nAnd I mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think our genes are pretty much involved in everything we do uh what what does it what about sleep\nWhat our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours of the quality what what one of the genes\nDoing that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about genes as you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role in timing sleep\nUm be at a time of day you prefer to sleep at the time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day recently most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restored if properties asleep\nThe things about sleep that preserve your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep that improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep or not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWell they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the ...\nAre not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWell they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the body\nThe gene that I focused on in my most recent study be on one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which\nWe have analyzed so be my one is what's known as a clot seem you have clocks in every selling your body very real clocks in order for\nSomething to be characterized as the clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears I talked to my students about gives on the clock most of them don't know the clock is er [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time it is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nFor a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain\nAnd most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks in the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain how to sleep more importantly how to recover from sleep loss\nAnd what do you mean how to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your terms that's how the hit on the goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep processing works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more if you get too much sleep it will go and the other direction the clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature\nIn the evening it says to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you\nSame as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature in the evening it says to go to another it works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved\nIn the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes that are as like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from now so when you say\nThe clock is that the the circadian rhythm we've been talking about\nThe circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate\nIt hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours Russian overhear yes I had a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking\nSo napping as it is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by ... an hour and I do have one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap in my office in the afternoon and no one can complain you can write at all I mean I Know what I'm doing research [laughter]\nBut you're saying napping is important is the mapping is very important if you're not getting daily sufficiently and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap\nMost of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not than getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommended but everything from a half hour to an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much much that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism\nUm especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one of the three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now\nOh gosh I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching\nBut you can't blame them either exactly right that's why I don't try to understand but that's just me let me go to the questions on this uh yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "19", "locations": [["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Iran", 32.0, 53.0], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["Istanbul", 41.01384, 28.94966], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Kandahar Province", 31.61332, 65.71013], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Kandahar Province", 31.61332, 65.71013], ["Kandahar", 31.61332, 65.71013], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["Beijing", 39.9075, 116.39723], ["London", 51.50853, -0.12574], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["the U.
