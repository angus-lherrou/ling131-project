shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was

any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had babies that you've just been more serious in general so mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nAnd Mm Mm Mm\nI think that's what I did was try to play\nAnd\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other or even if they had received us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember that part of Susan that she doesn't think about much her talk mess in the face of

for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one feels the worst I think because the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so\nEmotionally wrong that even watching it was a motion was upsetting\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report\nWhich held us all for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelief that the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one\nThere are people who haven't picked aside\nAnd incredibly sometimes those people

Senate wait for new FBI investigation then he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode you did recording him for months that he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near to

stood me up for an interview just late fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was ...\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination than English confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff

weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women in the morning to have any mind also we talked about it wasn't but I Do think there was a\nIt was a thing just not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories of sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with us they were being

age doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a deal like this undecided boots\nVery rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just as I'm sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got a I Would just urge colleagues to recognize that and then we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India\nAnd very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would

doubt a certainty\nGoing out of this room today and uh and just have a little humility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThan eight after the for Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also and his anger wasn't is
