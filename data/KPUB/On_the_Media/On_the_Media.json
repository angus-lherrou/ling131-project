I think he's a A N K in eight years or [noise]\nThis is on the media I'm Bob Garfield on election day Massachusetts citizens will weigh in on a referendum known as question three\nA yes vote preserves existing protections for trans individuals' against discrimination in public spaces a no vote returns the state to it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not illegal a protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle within the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on three campaign\nWhich is not a question do we mean\nHe's a woman can enter a woman's locker room\n... protect privacy and the rest\nIt's almost comical ... anti trends video but in a remarkable exercise in political hold me up at the the activists on the other side of the question many themselves trans went door to door\nWent door to door to share that ad\nWith potential voters it was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman\nWho a few years ago in Florida on another trans related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nAnd a lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there's no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but\nWell we actually found in the research is the canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training were able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way from a friendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation\nWith them so once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other ... groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients do a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we did the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knocked about recycling\nWhat we find when we do a series of follow up surveys three days three weeks six weeks and three months later\nIs that when we compare the group that we had that conversation with at the door versus the group we could have but did not\nThat treatment group is significantly more accepting of transgender people across the variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is it if you look at the chain\nThe average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is it if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve\nWe see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big effect\nDoes this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing\nOne thing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those trends phobic advertisements to say well if we showed them these ads is the effect of the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effect we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive\nMore over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely ... what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... know doesn't your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy on the matter of campaign theory\nActually entering the really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine moved from putting leeches on people and telling anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so\nYou should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who you subscribe to but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little\nAbout the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow up work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of place\nDoing lots of follow of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out our understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to a number of volunteers who have to fan out in a community\nWhich is why the campaign industrial complex is built around\nTelevision advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies\nHold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom of political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns that Bernie Sanders' campaign in twenty sixteen the ... campaign right now in Texas and many others who have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so\nFrom my perspective if campaigns don't try and really think about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors then it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success\nAnd in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy that normative leap might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or to do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team\nWhat you need is a candidate or a cause that many kinds of engaged individuals' want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical floating on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science\nOn sound or statistical footing on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nI wouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election result that's kind of the traps that the research on campaigns and elections and campaign consultant has been for a hundred years\nWhat we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign if they had done something else which of course we can't know because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures\n[laughter] well I think what we tend to see in other industries is that as new ideas and innovations come out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think the campaigns will or even necessarily should\nBe taking this one study we have and you know reorientate all their activities around it within the next year old on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence based that is very persuasive and rigorous and that prejudice reduction advocates will be interested in applying in their

copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars and the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty in the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope I reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell

humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the

intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there yeah Alcatraz\nSuddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight they declared at Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and having this this land nearby all for the following treated real purchase ... for twenty four dollars and glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar island about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of tune from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nJust as we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with a FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence

was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had done a dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timbre in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ... one of next\nFrom top to bottom because it had done the dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted

something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of at sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another\nDramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indian suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the current that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed [noise]\nKind

was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or misdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\n[noise]

and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim ... is a professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us has a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe know in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since talk of blood is lineage and said\nHave given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood\nBy marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk plays out in native culture\nI caution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you are looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors but does a lot ... at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities and didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people and their can these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment as governor and what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base role you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nYou see on the back of my traveling Roman card that I Am one thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and Rob a whole blood quote unquote is my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable I'd ...\nReally talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were for us it's who's your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's you\nSay your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly thirteenth thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father's non native\nNow if my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to one day\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards Lenny all dissent rules to try to make our rules more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women then this is something much she got some set in the New York or you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his times you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren ... I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma in the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this mess of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nYou know certainly for African Americans even though there's very much a historical and understandable desire to\nBe able to lay claim to identities that are not just about race has cast mhm it's also the case that particularly at a place like the United states and twenty Eighteen that's deeply polarized and becoming\nDeeply racialized no one is making find distinctions in the workplace\nAnd the housing market between forms of African ethnicity or whether or not someone is deemed to be just black or white and what those racial identities experience as they are entitled people to or don't entitle people too in the world\nAlondra thank you very much it's a pleasure to speak with uber\nAlondra Nelson is president of the social science Research Council professor of sociology at Columbia University and author of the social life of DNA race reparations and reconciliation after the [noise]\nApplication of genetic research and another kind of controversy twins disease on me [noise]\n\nGenetic research and another kind of controversy twins to seize on me [laughter] on\nThe media is supported by target preventing future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing and communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie cats or wherever pond caster found\nK. and it continues on the media\nRemembering being um in France dominant brought New Orleans rhythm and blues and rock and roll also British ... did you have with American music on radio and came to the U.S agree to new ... roots rock I'm next bits are joined me for American roots for ...

these children were never told they were twins and most of his adoptive parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too\nSo to not tell people this very important aspect of their background\nI think is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and I did\nBecause being a twin is a very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart\nJust how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture

twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life histories of two sets identical male twins who were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city\nA day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as the other twins were born\nAnd somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange was one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other\nI went to a Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life histories are amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the Media", "city": "Flagstaff",

history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be\nAnd in the nineteenth century as economics was becoming professionalized economists picked up this barter origin story for money and kind of set it forced into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you attack a plated string decorated with calories and

stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today and that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your apples\nUniversal why is this news to me\nVery often origin stories are serving contemporary
