alcohol by volume Elijah crack promotes responsible drinking and from the any each case the foundation\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise in our show today ideas about who we are what makes us us\nAnd we've been talking about chemists Sam Steinberg who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you're basically talking like super heroes right like perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores\nRight those are the you know the I think that's that's the science fictional vision of what\nCRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leaner muscles\nOr lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow we now have a technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably there's a great example in the world of HIV\nWill to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the ... version if it seems like that that technology is a promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient a painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits still inherit from the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents\nIt's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention\nAnd genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes use your five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders\nSweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual but\nThat individuals children and their chili\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think\nYou have this very rainy issue of directing future evolution you know\nEven saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use him embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher I.

ideas about food or connection to it and its power to change so much\nThe way we live I just bought a bottle of water and on the label it said gluten free interest [laughter] well and it is [laughter] versus food writer Mark Bittman Jerusalem advertising and marketing and describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy\n... says food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and extend describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat had become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell an easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call Monica cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all\nCultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late nineteenth early twentieth century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest their second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown and now I Know it was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Sawyer corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing camps\nGood but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal meet a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice for dessert\nStore bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed by the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat\nAnd spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the blend things that people were serving at home at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden\nSo now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the various stuff that will kill you\n\nGet ... and ... like what you were saying earlier are a lot of that has to do with with the fact that like today we ship food all over the world right [noise] you know I think part of the problem\nIs you know this could go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we\nYou know I think part of the problem is that this could go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need to everything that you you are a guy that a lot of people can look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you are a food to eat like I think of ... Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat well\nI Do think you know I did this book called the ... going before six or\nA few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever but I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have\nLabels and you know of the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because at our broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules you eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n[noise]\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem\nGoing to have a good diet\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now there is no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients implants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not born craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path thank you [noise]\n\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at ... dot com\nI'm willing to you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I'd say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next [laughter] who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago was that pasta and

you not eat pasta why the hell you can get sweet potato pasta which is which is paleo from a housing prices gonna kill ya\nOkay some argument saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate at Seventy four percent I Seventy four percent of all of

on even though they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles has the\nThe tobacco and the dark chocolates in the state and fruits and so on even though they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles Spence on the stage\nOr here this morning to I'll tell you about the perfect meal\nRural convinced we can taste the food we enjoyed the flavors ... of the wind in the last\nReflect what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study of how to measure it and the tendency among the scientists that the New York gets thrown its its just think people like your eye and a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink see which parts of the brain light up this is that it's going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy\nIs one problem here which is in fact I mean the mattress off one of the brain scan is lying on your back where they had climbed stale with a Cuban your marriage that periodically ... sin ah some drink you call it can be full of your head all kind of a jolt and that will spoil that the brain scan alignment\nBut it's kind of tells you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\nI was actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be with something very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um [noise] the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nUh I Know one of the perfect meal when the fighting with up hot in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in then you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed you on hold\nKind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in the end you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed your holiday less stressed with their family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were sort of thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions of its um I was in the province all rose a paradox ... used to describe a northern Europeans um but to Italy who gave for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nOr not sitting somewhere or on the side of the sea sipping that arose they wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all out and not taste like the best glass of wine you've ever had\nSo great that you want to buy a Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you have in that you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap ... yeah I can say well how is it something about when the bottles when they're playing with a cold and I you know sport the wind things not about a tool we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments and certain state of mind\nOn all mental state and the environment both together kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile in a way some\nMyths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation\nAnd put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food\n[noise] in fact is Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and you know methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients for in a good mood\nTo try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood food tastes good even a bad mood they never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass brain has brought me everything else the thousands of single the smell of assaulting see at the wall of the San ... all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing that inside in the dishes or\nAny of that too much than style restaurant in in Switzerland tuition and star restaurant\nA white table cloths\nWas no ... on the table was no glasses and I play nothing there's just a plastic car people wait and see what he calls me here seven o'clock hour here and everyone is here in the restaurant now I can see what will tables full nothing will happen\nUntil somebody picks up here is late ... plastic how\nI Wonder if they get up you know there is a little one euro tower and it makes it moving sound and sort of some of those type of it that will be laughing\nAnd then even guaranteed within a minute you'll have a whole restaurant full of moving fire was laughing Dina's ... is the moment when the first issue comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table in Homs the mood and he knows that will improve even the taste of a two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise] wow so like from from a neurological perspective\nDo we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case\n[noise] uh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all kind of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with a young chef which is if you have here in London\nAnd he's been I'm sending our question I asked for several weeks have to ... his restaurant like say what'd you remember yeah and he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of construction something they remember the experience but I felt about it\nAnd people are convinced they can remember in ... when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they don't have the experience that I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details I think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas do do they think yeah it is it is about the experience he's right or they or did they say and this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in color a school day is just the sourcing the preparation\nBut nothing else but he says their case so I'm In a restaurant or do you serve the food remarried plastic cutlery known as a silver isn't it and what is your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking at it and they ... so the the saying all these things on the one hand but clearly\nYou can have as well so who just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment and there's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now putting up starting\nTheir own venues who who are really thing for the first time in history saying we don't need to just about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were swimming [noise] [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote

[noise] [noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nAnd the person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very\nNarrow way I mean like you mean like ... men or\nActually Freeman or persons but slaves were\nNot sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be the person's [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons they get a more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so it can you explain\nLegal persons bacon is more complicated than that right because\nLike in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so can you explain how that works so a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example in the last\nFew years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights in national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal right and [noise]\nIt's even live in these recent changes as a positive step toward broadening the definition of legal person to include animals at the highest he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation like Peter Singer ...

realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew\nKnown about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time\n[noise] so your objective at that time was to essentially [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] change the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided to that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the one critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and after I got\nJames decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because when they ... century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nTo help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures to Kansas City of London signed him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law the heaviest corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSummer said was a legal thing he was not eligible for I read of heaviest corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that\nHe would assume without deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have just corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain to shift their a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support any order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate ... the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as long as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your genes summers and of course a non human version of James hammers and I started to look for my James\nCase you realized you needed to find your James Summers and of course a non human version of James hammers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find her ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the non human animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds\nAnd hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on we filed a hundred and sixty pages of half a day that we say altogether\nIt shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being

Adams saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years is that kind of income\nI Would of course\nProbably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nFact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first ah pollen in the world to\nInstigate a one day like the chamber in one solution chamber once will titian buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busy back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for ... uh this is a path to old is the idea [noise]\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute these parliaments tried to society of friends I think we should populated our parliament with randomly selected people\nAnd we don't judge my neighbor gets chosen\nThey say to your friends I think we should populated parliament with randomly selected people\nRely judging what if my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate his recycling box the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these Monday examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of costs not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to get the citizens assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to\nA sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the wood is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe ... spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with a second buddies selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a hugely ill battle is to try to convince people and then entrenched powers to um to try this\nYes uh yeah it ... it I'm not I think it will be easy to political changes every easy uh especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that\nYeah I'm not going to be easy to political changes ... seats\nAre especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state
