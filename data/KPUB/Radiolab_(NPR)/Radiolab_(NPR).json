I'm ... which is radiolab and today we have a legal case\nWell it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin and this is Lisa learning I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nHappy Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna federal who brought us the story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me not know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSearching Tracey my name's Jim Tracy I'm an award winning ...\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nShirt in Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post starring Glenn falls he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think there is and he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people does Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the outer on ducks pulled off the road a aside rode out through thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two tenths and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up\nAnd about nine AM to campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw for this middle aged man peering into the tent\nWho looked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees and started marching the kids off into the woods took them into the woods near a brook compare the two with him behind them\nThe kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some ropes basically he had he had the each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun Adam and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old\nThe gun at him and then the last one he tied so after we had the ... people died he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening in in ... with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times in the chest\nAnd when this happened three of them in their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick ... to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them\nDavid Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had um lay down in a ditch next to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our men come men that\nThe other two campaigns the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals are new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted dumb killer and Friedman laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun is going to shoot and then enter the gun just kind of stood up\nCalmly and Cooley walked into the forest\nAnd us began\nWhat was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nIt was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today with a broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case\nGuns flood homes that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and come back with an ID eight\nThirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York as a fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict people dying in prison for rape tips seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle a knife and\nThe story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when people got panicked when you're all are well one of the doors are shorter ... people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast that I'm aware that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers said the man has done what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follower lead and that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer may ... spotted gal\nSaid please or got big on something of that fact and Guerra started running\nBlack fired four times got him in the back the arm and the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw Darrow and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead 'cause he was just laying there but\nThey you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly\nGirl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but but you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're drilling and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for\nA girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk to this point that the story that I'm\nInterested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor lethal Armand again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do\nIn the situation okay and we are recording I saw the guy at the center\nOf this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nBreakage army\nBrenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York is our money's now in his eighties he's retired [noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl um\nWhere I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like what how did this whole\nStory start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk away or ... or like ... flights go forwards likes\nHe said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I liked ... fights physical flights I'd like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for or defend it you're fighting this state and tyranny\nAnd he's doing really well he is well respected had a good reputation\nThen he met Robert De Niro yeah like a strong man to take him out you know forty five and a or to head the feeling that this guy is dangerous and love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things one on\nClosed up mine shaft the mind and ... about an hour south of the hospital in federal run next in that moment were you scared where are you excited like oh ... years up it's a high but you're scared you're concerned yes fear your food\nIf you do in fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd went into one\nBar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out there about thirty minutes don't you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went off the back door [noise]\nTook of driving that lady friends car to try the news too and so they got back on the highway and drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this may be as far\nAs we can walk\nUp to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren ... and Tom supervisor of Mariah Tom's cause a father so that some a road that goes to the miners are what is clear to them on [noise] it was that sort of hilly area off the side of the road is is a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nBecause I'm very icy that day this hair is used to be an all road [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills fairly feet there were no leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm very skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are mania\nFairly the there were no leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they came in here\nSo right up there so here we are in our Sunday suits and here we go tragedy choose for is looking for the case [noise]\nBut lovable worse looking around [noise]\nFrom this when her well\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which it was just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully at this as any such\nYeah they don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then they'll see how my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak a blue shoe a blue sneaker\n[noise]\nAnd and a leg and I said to myself the son of a bitch does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of the year\nBoom ... backup that\nThey'll gee found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her\nBut Armani wasn't there when the algae founder so what ensued was a very ...\nHad said he'd left her\nArmani wasn't there when delta G founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we\nTook her to know to keep the confidence is over ... under the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time this happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or a substantial bodily harm\nThat will be ... that is yeah it can be or will be okay right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's low future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired\nDetectives and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if the people are already dead than you do the lawyers shoe\nThat's right\nA really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what year\nAll in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to get to play the part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates them even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for that client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of land or also citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happens in hell knows what happens right if we cheer building on on the side of tell just tell tale\nOf course yes when I moved to hook from booming [noise]\n'cause his du da\nDa da da da da da da da da and they knew him from church and\nWhat not to be and then I'm On a few big pushes the parents\nOf the family and yet you have your duty as a

I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right there when they knew this thing but it is a client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move well\nSo they decided to put the burden plea bargain that take this information to the prosecutor and say I have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes\nAnd in exchange I Want you to give me a better deal for my client to get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison also right away they are going to use this as leverage\nThat was the idea yeah you're going to give a moon you're going to take it a little well that's kinda gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank's perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again they called a meeting with Andrew McCabe investigator from the state police\nI Do to make a movie\nHe was just barely getting by for a little while I think the older older to stress and pressure searches true to all in fact he has a heart attack\nUm while this is all going on\nBut eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar is that what Belgian our money did\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven as for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that I don't go with this\nIn the midst of the hardest part no\nNever dreamed I don't go was here or there was a lawyer the donors draw up a ... I was a good lawyer ... through\nArt everybody um and now running over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if\nYou will face so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand up [noise] um [noise]\nI agree um his duty is to his client who represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls\nOne of the victims and she initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was a girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money and build you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools were teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes and it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victim and I think that that should at least be an equal thought in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um that that that you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was\nA greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all this was happening\nYes and only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and up\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policemen at the time that we were with received a phone call that the unease my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really had any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nIn the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did\nIt was a totally lie a lawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of\nOf horror and [laughter]\nAnd this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nAnyway just to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone law professors law students there um when they approached this is it's with a lot of sensitivity and\nInvolved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach this as it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could\nAny of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to\nCommunicate some of that um experience\nWell it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering ... we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you'd want to share I don't know when you don't have to but [noise]\nWell [noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree posthumously ah we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us and um [noise]\nAnd Danny what's her boyfriend had been just that summer and he had a full scholarship to her and he graduated just before and so to live and I'm sure the other two children had\nGreat future's ahead of them too and it's just a horrible tragedy [laughter]\n\n\n\nIt's\nHorrible you know to be in a position\nTo have to live [noise] I mean how how do you really lose your your daughter you know what what excuses for it to protect you the person to kill her\nNo justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it\nThat's the way it is [noise]\n\n\nUm and then you get just a minute of silence I tear if that's okay

[noise]\nHey I'm ...

pie [laughter]\n[laughter] okay I think it's good All right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah start again that was what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nWhen that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly aching and the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while\nLaw enforcement officer involved shootings and it struck me at the time that like ... what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire near rice and Harris than double John him over there and we'll come sort of a national story [noise]\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part and I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for an itself in the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban and his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented burned\nSo first study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records loss and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places in ... the government has been sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd build a database and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there last link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keep track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found it initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this the the numbers are flat\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers of stayed steady but a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they call suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually are mentally ill\nApparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon so it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who covered\nBut I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know they're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week but it was new to us I mean clearly\nPolice are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country [noise]\nBut when it got to Ben central question what do the numbers say about race I think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a dad as out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely\nTo be shot by police than if you're white southern tell us much right now but the breakdown between fake ... for their same demographics and it's that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade uh Seventy percent involve some\nForm of resisting arrest you know and we talked with in the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty numbers themselves don't really get you very foreign percent six ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is only one\nUltimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what's [noise] gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were and why we want to start this methane gas is I've still just moved by the single cases the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nWant to start this nasty nasty such still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise] you know [noise] I mean there are written in this uh\nInvestigations revealed that a SPIC officer Matthew Fowler received a call ... to Cato sterile police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles armed with a knife a department to five five but household every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either\nYou know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed\nDefied what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged ... so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah flick past and present at the same time like\nYou can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right then if I'm having\nTo get in the ...\nWherever insightful then something happened in you know here in Florida\nOr so after the event ended up the community center crystal took a bunch of the Mondale got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this every every event or no no this one is on track to no good ones and has been telling everyone about\nThis dinner just with her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nYou know we didn't know anything about this but it it must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping ... right right we all just simply trying\nOur way is a crystal gathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with\nMy grief you can either get the um the largest age as they are going because it was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really I go through my house she says the same age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nI go on my house she says his age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to crystal [noise]\nMid sized one story house in twins and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin where the kitchen\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them or their own stories you stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n[laughter]\nThe night before they'd all gone out dancing together\nFor the summer when a fire [noise]\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton's we're starting to stay over eight inches of houses\nWe sleep in each other head on the couch you know a mattress is it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the Ford asleep or talking you know getting to know each other you know some sort of by shows resources like therapy for\nIn the past but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me\nMarlon promise to\nWin crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we basically just in someone's backyard just walking\nAnd about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grad so we usually the video that\nMy house probably over like right now\nThen the police car that came behind them was probably right here\nAnd then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we recall execution a vegetable garden 'cause\nAnd all that but I I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and type of stuff we came back at us all you can smell what's going on and so now like when you have any like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just\nYou get those flat ...\nFinish brings you right back here mhm\n... was just kind of stood there for a minute [noise]\n... some of the other one that started to cry\n\nThen you don't want me to uh take some yeah my find the best\nCouple of women enemy their phones man\n\nAnd then handed me the phone my\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face\nThree to one\nThree two one [noise]\nAnd we all started walking back to put the cars [noise]\nSharing with us but I Know [noise]\nIt was a set of ... we saw that last week\nAnd I three o'clock in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember the and I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son's greatest about Fifteen minutes tops and where\nI visit home I have to go there all the time of horror Maggie yeah that would force how could you not\nThen I Know what you like you want to go take a tear\nSit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a listen it's a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you can go about it as like a certain time every\nAnd it's this little white man his share everything that I like he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nI don't know if you're in the way I like going on about and all of that and it's a little white guy that always did not do\nYou take his chair I Can't go home I Would I don't know but um\nAnd all of that is a little what got us all waste it not no\nHe take his chair I Campbell holes I Would I Do um\n[noise]\n\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise]\nAre you a ... who was some other ... she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nChewed on stage with Michael Brown smother Eric Garner's mother I watched as my daughter was lower than to the ...\nAnd understand that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers but\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in the short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group\nAnd suddenly become\nAnd down the cop with a gun and men with a knife\nAnd look at the razor thin life or death moment between them\nAnd you got to get so stay with us\nThis is Christopher calling from South

it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot on your best shot I see you want to die I Want you want to die you can't die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police sports can kill\nA fan

that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans into court judge that one of them you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use mobile command first\nAdvantage they didn't pull right up and the guy leans into court judge that one I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause the guys partner was holding a gun how do you heard this hot you might have to leave reacted thinking I was a gunshot and fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek Derek isn't just a\nBlack man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there's no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody as nameless faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finished watching a video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nUnlike us through the neighborhood that you might miss it on the front step wisdom hatred what are you doing man that Derrick does stupid but but you don't have close came to be in bed wouldn't be back with his medication I wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now [noise]\nNow again are almost kinda

and it twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity of human life [noise]\nNow just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nHave become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are\nPossibly changing the way police things done in America

the beginning Yeh started again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again and press how many people do is they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire ants Amir arrived hasten Harris than about John become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble and processing now like number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply you know the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere\nStruck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire near rice and Harris sand in the journal nature and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply you know the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody attracts these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere within the police for an itself in the\nPolice department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally\nBut everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that's right so Ben and his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBirth birth study had Florida it's a third biggest

they're both probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nLike say then put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show that\nA lot back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall\nWe've got um broken down by county but you can see uh\nSo a or B county\nBooker aton Boynton Beach uh all the way through the\nAlphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nIs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting and the state of Florida and in six years time two thousand nine to ... us some fourteen

each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an armed suspect wizard chase all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest and sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they've steady but a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd 'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem\nThe numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side\nAnd is that the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they've steady but a hundred thirty people shot by police every

been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cop which is where somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThey're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto frontline and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with ah the Florida\nPeople who cover police apparently know quite well you know they're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week but it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto frontline and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tells much right now but the breakdown between fake ... for their same demographics and it's that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far percent six ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what's [noise] gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were and why we want to start this methane gas comes I still just moved by the single cases the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise] I mean they're all written in this uh supplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call on this as to\nSix kind of ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is only one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah I mean [noise] I mean what's what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were and why we want to start this nasty nasty stuff still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nYou know [noise] I mean they're all written in this uh\nIt was a horrible thing and a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his first wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun and a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd this is something you do see impacts numbers even though the numbers themselves\nThey they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged and so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah flick past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right\nTo get into cars to brown\nAnd this is something you do see impacts numbers even though the numbers themselves\nThey they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed

hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin\nWhere the kitchen\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together\nFrom earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton's we're starting to stay over eight inches of how we see each other head of couch you know a air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the policy\nThe night before they'd all gone out dancing together\nTo

of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass so we usually the video that's\nMom's house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police caught up came behind him was probably right here\nAnd then the officer they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetables are because\nThat I Am then 'cause I'm when a when you know when they took him away in released and sit down and type of stuff we came back at us all you can smell it\nAnd then the police car that time behind him was probably right here\nAnd then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nCame in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetable garden 'cause\nAnd all that but I I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down to type of stuff we came back here is all you can smell what's going on and so now like when you have any like it's it's not as it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just\nYou get those flat mhm\nHad just brings you right back here mhm\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute [noise]\n'cause those guys are ... the other one that started to cry\n\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take some yeah my ...\nA lot of what about the phone to me a couple of women had their phones man\n[noise]\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nTo uh take some yeah my find to be\nA lot of what about appalling to me a couple of women enemy their phones mine\n[noise]\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back up to the cars [noise]\nSharing that with us because I Know

[noise]\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nCan either repeal it was some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown smother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter\nWas lower than to the ground\nAnd it was around this time of the few these women started called themselves the mothers but\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\nChewed on stage with Michael brands mother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter\nWas lower than to the ...\nAnd is there understand that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers of the movement [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group\nAnd suddenly become\nComing up and put it down a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between them so stay with us\n\n\nThis shirtless black guy\nThat's the kind of talking on the cop or anybody can end this black man goes on race pretty big knife in his hand and he's walking towards the ... once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike it gets closer and closer and closer and finally the cop when the ... the other officer out it was a refrain is behind him was his firearm out in the\nGuy is approaching approaching approaching approaching\nMe get within like ten feet of the cops and then\n[noise] the\nGuy was camp fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he has over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central four cups and then\nThere may not if it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why\n[noise] the guy with\nThe camp fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he goes over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then she became central four cups and then\nThere may not have it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at\nMe you were lucky you didn't just shot on your best shot you want a guy you want to die [laughter] you can't die\nHe tells the officer was um Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police bullets can't kill\nTheir fan of counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the un\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will you use this video for what ... is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we hit home or the officers used time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans unicorn judge that one I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away to use verbal command first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\n\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest of communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind\nAll right up and the guy leans into court judge that woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause the guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking I was a gunshot and fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek Derek isn't just a black\nMan shirtless with a knife in his hand when there was no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody as nameless faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of or a poor that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finished watching the video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nMight get through the neighborhood if you want to miss it on the front step waves ... what are you doing man\nDid Derek does stupid\nSon of a bitch you and how close came to be in that wouldn't be back with his medication I wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now [noise]\nNow again are almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona\nAt this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nLast say primary election among the winners ... just released his how foolish county sheriff like she would was elected sheriff of\nCounty [noise]\nWouldn't be back with his medication wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\n[noise] now again uh almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the winner stay totally just please change his now ... county sheriff like shit would was elected sheriff of\nLinn county [noise] extremely\nWhich is the county that they told them each belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a ... long says organization called her which is decrease executive research forum\nIt's this big coalition of police chiefs and a twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity of human life [noise]\nYou know just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago huh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho uh I've become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who er\nGet more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that

buck knife binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get cause someone to tell you the trees and he started marching in the case\nAnd said listen or killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods took him into the woods near a brook impair the two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real

seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and\nThe story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when the people got panic when you're all are well one of the doors are shorter ... people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving round here but people left the area so fast I don't hear that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers so that the man has done what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men or\nThe police following the lead and that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted gal\nDecent freeze or got big on something of that fact and scare started running ...\nSpotted Darrow these a freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and scare started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time I saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but it you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise]\nBut you wouldn't talk\nAnd it's at this point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor release alarm and again he's\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording and so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrankly each arm and he\nRan to the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use our money but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producer Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl um\nRetired [noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert\nGirl um\nWhere I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like what how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fights I'd like standing up for the little guy\nAnd that's partly why he became an attorney\nWhen you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting this state and tyranny\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation\nThen he met Robert De Niro yeah life you're strong to take him out you need a forty five and a or just had the feeling that this guy is dangerous and love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things while I'm On\nThat Susan pets was in an era event of a\nClosed up mine shaft the mine ... mine ... about an hour south of the hospital ... federally run mixture and in that moment where you scared were you excited like oh you rub ... high but you're scared you're concerned for your your food for you to do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talked to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up the back door [noise]\nTook of driving that lady friends car to try to lose too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nDismissed as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nOut there last February with reporter Lauren my chemistry and Tom supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause if Ava system a road that goes to the miners are what is your up to them on [noise] it was this sort of hidden\nProvider of Mariah Tom's cause if Ava so that them a road that goes to the miners are what is your after the minds [noise] it was that sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nA very icy that day this hair is used to be an old roadway [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hill is fairly cheap there were no leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm very skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that Armenian this is the only way they could've came in here\nThat so here we are in our Sunday suits and here we go trudging choose for is looking for the case [noise]\n\nSpent another ... works looking around [noise]\nWe found this was her van to well\nYou see the air shaft there they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you carefully this has given any such yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you hope my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the shoe a blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this the bitch does it\nBlue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this ... does it end he yells back up to Belgium kept me out of your\nMoney back up do\nEventually algae found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Guerra headset he left her\nBut our money wasn't there when ... founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you\nCan't you just can't we took you know to keep your confidences over ...\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there is no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's\nFrightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if the if the if the people are already dead than you do the lawyers ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to to play the part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client\nOnly only the agent of land or also a citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a ... year building on on the side of ... just tell tale\nOf course soon I knew Mr hawk from going to lose his du da da da da da da da da da da and I knew him from sturgeon\nOne if you have to be a man I'm On a few ... the parents\nOf the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n[noise]\nSo now what does she [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise]\nWe'll be right back

I'm A Rod's I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they'd found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move wild\nSo they decided to put the burden plea bargain\nTake this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give the moon and you're going to take a ... well\nThat's kinda gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's a way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again\nI Do to make a movie\nHe was just barely getting by for a little while I think the older the stress and pressure to ... to ...\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on\nBut eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar is that what Belgian our money did\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so it's Meyer Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch in Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nLisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven is for the American bar association\nAnd Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAnd Lisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven as for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love\nFeast does what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job\nA ... I was a good lawyer\nWho saw I saw so art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if\nPeople say so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand up um\nI agree um his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to it they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story\n\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing their mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is\nTotally and comprehensible\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes\nTo do things in an ethical classes\nAnd comprehensible to me\nAnd the first that you heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as this was happening\nYes and only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policemen at the time that we were with received a phone call that the unease my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really had any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who was um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my\nMy father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a totally lie a lawyer\nAnd as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a totally lie a lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise] so anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approached this is it's with\nA lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later I'm Still\nI I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering what we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know you don't have to but [noise]\nWell [noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree passed you mostly ah we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us\nAnd um [noise]\nAnd Danny what's her boyfriend had\nWay too difficult for us\nAnd what's your boyfriend had bad just that summer and get a full scholarship to harbor any uh graduated just before too\nAnd I'm sure to children had great future ahead of true and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nIt's a horrible you know to be in the position\n[noise] I mean how do you release whose daughter would what excuses for protecting the person to killed or\nSnow justification you couldn't just apply in my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it\nBut that's the way it is\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence I hear that's okay\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's okay [noise] yeah [noise]\n[laughter]", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "28", "locations": [["Arizona",

Ron I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't say that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we must but we know is it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make someone on yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon ... so let's start can we start in two thousand they sure about what the song yes please ...\n\nSo ah December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are seeing and swaying directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nA middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [laughter]\nFacebook [laughter] yeah\nIt was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies that right there are you guys are\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm Stephanie newer\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be disciplined and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook\nIn these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for uploading um pornographic content and people were really getting\nTheir backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n[noise]\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that the small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shot Facebook triggered hordes now and what would become a loud\nFacebook ... rockets\nAnd global battle\nEmbattled Facebook CEOs today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in the election meddling or data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of those\nFree speech\nBut rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of those free speech\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say that again by this iconic photograph what we\nCan see and what we can see I'd let Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn my\n[noise]\nMr sack of arc I got to\nDo you use objectively prioritize or censor speech\nCongresswoman we don't and global for doing of censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documents it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAnd diet in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like what are these rules\nHow were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning in two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter] [noise]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group\nFacebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do I'm cool\nBehind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room\nTrying to figure out what to do I'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just read so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither of these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this isn't nearly two thousand seismic changes this leak and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path and ice may Scott ...\nIs now the most visited website in the U.S they still had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids\nAnd so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table\nEach of them in front of their own computer and things that come up onto their ... to Facebook\nAnd on Lake meaning like Iowa user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like our reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate chronic she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in his early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content\nAnd then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever\nThings that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a\nPhoto of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take a doubt\nAnd at the time if you didn't know what to do you would turn near pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this\nAnd they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach was there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of they had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that as one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry that that the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad\nSo as Hitler and um if it makes me feel bad take it down and so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\nRise up fight for the lights are\nBetter anyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse and two for one\nChanged their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change the status to the title of our group a Facebook\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title if I cook a Facebook breastfeeding it's not [noise] and it caught on the social networking website is under fire for any pollinate on photos of women threatened leading their children down in twelve\nThousand members participated and the media request started pouring in the face of a bad thing is not I didn't and hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington Post\nThere is a floor and the Celtics where faith but as far as his content moderators itself\nAround twenty tend they decided to start out sourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter or a home and draw as well as I mean I Would guess what they're saying\nSort of thing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter or a home and drop as well as\nI mean I Would guess that there are people\nDublin where we sent reporters Guerra stack\nScene where they get their dishes Facebook treats cooked everybody fever English and we sent\nThem there to try to talk to some of these people to for a living sit at a

I'm Robert Krulwich has radiolab we're back\nWith our story about Facebook and free speech and we just want our minds you guys are are those who you're just tuning in this episode does contain some graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you're you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing because we were kids in the room may want to sit it out yeah okay back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty third ticket ...\nHey Rhonda Merrill aside but sorry for them to get up thank you I mean how can break we asked them\nApril fifteenth twenty Thirteen ...\nHey girl at Rhonda Marilyn thanks but sorry my my aunt had him to get up thank you I mean how can break we asked them breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carl\nMonday the fifteenth twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bomb\nThe finish line Boston Marathon\nHave sort of does begin to settle\nAre springing into action\nOr just one man in a cowboy hat sees a spectator who who's been injured picked him up rose him in a wheelchair\nIn as they're pushing him through the the sort of ash cloud that there's a photographer there any snapped couscous\nAnd the photo shows that the runner in the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who uh his face is Ashton from all the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific\nMeanwhile CBS VW a studio on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day\nFacebook employees are clustering around several desks staring at the computer screens watching the news during\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so high up\nMemories of uh watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that [noise] someone had but\nCoverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombings\nI remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that\nSomeone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly voters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together and sat down in the conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however have to ... says\nNo the other people are saying this as newsworthy essentially this photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately receives\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and there are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements we made the guidelines for moments like this do which the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of the stuff\nThat in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons\nAny of the questions about any of the rest of the stuff that in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decided to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... sent down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this doubt\nYes oh yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have but the major news judgment and just really knew what they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech\nLike is Facebook is sort of collective scrap book for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now in news organization trends parents here let me\nLet me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when ... was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so\nWhich are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content\nWe do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your content which made exactly the kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically ... and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the well Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations\nHowever were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what what what really strikes me about all of this is if you're you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting\nA set of rules that are both as objective as possible and can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting were important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and
