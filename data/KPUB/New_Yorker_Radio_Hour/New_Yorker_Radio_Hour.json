I was a rebellious Christian\nNow you're also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access\nGot kicked out yeah I was ... I was a rebellious Christian [noise]\nNow you also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records and radio\nI didn't have access to musical theater and what else did you play as we get our Cinderella I can totally unrelated as we did a production or I went to a predominantly black a high school Latina a Latino and black high school and\nUm you've got all the lead singer I didn't actually funny where did you not get the lead the whiz I did not get the whiz I wanted to be Dorothy so\nYou're still mad about it [laughter]\nI'm I'm kind of deal but I understood it but it crushed me growing up it really crush me\nNow at what point did you think I can have a big life like something that's beyond being in high school musical something beyond being a maybe the best singer at your high school something larger than that\nI don't think I registered until I went to New York post high school I went to the American musical and dramatics academy\nAnd I started to learn more and I start to grow\nAnd when I realized that there was more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was an access potential that was there\nAnd that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell fresher story who we are heroes at that time Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration\nAnd I love Judy Garland yeah arguing Judy Garland were were my my my heroes those are pretty different performers why those two they were just women that I felt really use their voices you need to have a first of all unique tone\nUm and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland obviously I'm from\nThat first of all you need tone um and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland obviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that\nUm I feel like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life\nBut Lauren Hill in particular I resonated with me as a black woman who did an album and made a career fully being herself she did not shy away from her religious belief she didn't shy away from 'em you know being a mom during a time where people say that she could not\nHave a child who were ruined her career um she she was an actress she was an actor she was a singer uh she was a producer she was a ... and that was how when the model my career\n... ... ... what's your song from an early album that's called violet stars happy hunting and this was from an album called metropolis betray sweet\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nYou know it is I haven't heard it in a long time now that sounds like something out of out of a musical is that what you said after right [noise]\nYes you know what will I wouldn't say a musical where I wanted to do was to figure out how I could sing songs\nHave concepts for them if I wanted to talk about science fiction which was a huge inspiration to me after I watched Fritz Lang Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent film when I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it is\nAnd to me after I watched Fritz Lang Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent film\nWhen I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it inspired all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the money that\nBy the stars heavy hunting at that we just heard but what I wanted to do is figure out how to you take how can I take all of me on stage like am I Am theatrical I Love singing I Love ... love rock and roll 'em I Love you know dressing in his black

behind her but you were projecting this self which was um\nA a complicated thing which all that you are [laughter] um why use her as it were instead of being yourself and as you are now in in the in the latest um dirty computer\nWas saying that Cindy Mayweather represented represented aspirations for me that's who I strive to be more like I'm not so she is in the future and in the future she's more evolved and she doesn't have eagle all the things that\nMake me imperfect she's able to master those\n... so this is a ... a self critical expression by having an alter ego yes somewhere absolute what we're used to being self critical about in your in your younger self\nWell my younger self I just felt a misunderstood a lot of people will call me weird they relied right oh that's not commercial enough they didn't under they just did not understand how they were going to market or what it was it I was doing\nThey'd be like oh that's not commercial enough they didn't under they just did not understand how they were going to market or what it was that I was doing and just\nWhat do they want you to be [noise] I don't think it was about\nWanting me to be something I think it was really about not wanting to do the work in the development that it would take\nTo figure out how to bring something new to the industry it was like the quick thing would be well you know change your hair one change her outfits need is to actually be appealing\nAnd you said I'm I'm not exhausted 'cause I Know I\nGet to be invited back you're very very long time in a scribe that night with your members of the ... oh my goodness uh\nIt'd be invited back you're very very long time it is growing at night with your members over where\nOh my goodness of I just remember a lot of celebration but sadness under that celebration and just to think like man all the hard work that he had done and\nI was going to be unraveled in an undone and controls eat delete it um [laughter] I Do remember saying that to you and [noise]\nUm but what I Will say is I Want to focus on now and right now I'm working with an organization when we all vote to help get awareness out\nAfter studying the twenty twelve

Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and al ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance go rogue\nWere on a leafy suburb and straight their colonial houses which are made of brac inside and was final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five\nShe works in marketing have you heard about running for office Daniel ... you do okay well I actually live right on Devon drive and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighborhood here have been dealing with us\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fence saying that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fencing that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party\nUm there are one two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within\nFive fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fears and now with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impact how to your fears about an impact your life um [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in ... county in Pennsylvania and it was a snow cone pipeline that was only a week old\nAnd so\nI actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\nOf like my babies like burning in her bed and I'm I called them and I said John we have to move like you have to move we can't [noise] um\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there are only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless destroyed um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [noise]\nSo you know we're here trying to connect some of the dots between what's going on politically nationally\nAs well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline\nBetween what's going on politically nationally\nAs well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics\nJust an example of the egregious enough of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occur to me it just wasn't something\nLike maybe I thought it would run for school\nBoard or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are the people who represent us [noise] it's it's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nDaniels opponent and district one fifty five is Becky carbon a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve I reach representative carbon for an interview and she sent the following statement I have a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community\nThen she lifted her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\n[noise] ... but here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics are both the Republican legislature and the Democratic\nTom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking is made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state in America and and that's brought in a lot of different players including to know go and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this\nAnd\nAnd that's brought in a lot of different players including ... and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline safety is our top priorities are highly skilled engineers environmental scientist wildlife biology and geology design on pipeline to follow the safest round with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP as a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline move natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the east markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas\nWe were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop was a hundred miles west of action in the small town of blows or fail\nAt blooms gun shop we not Ralph and Doris blue\nNow the fact checkers at the New Yorker I don't want to brag but they have something of a reputation so when Ratcliffe want it to get a taste of what fact checking was really like it made sense for him to come by the office and try his hand at it here's Peter can be who runs the fact checking department\nSo they know wrecked cooked showed up at my office shortly after town on a Monday morning along with Michael showman who writes about theater for the New York\n[noise] [noise]\nOh well thank you very much [laughter] and he didn't look unlike under ...\nAnd I wondered whether that had something to do with his intense immersion in the play where he plays a fact checker in a mortal combat where the where the difficult writer\nBecause of because one of one of the\nPolicy to sort of the flaws in I'm In a little bit in like ... asking if I see a U.S know that it's easy differentiate between label one of our schools have things in the same job I have sort of gifts for white to everything everything\nMean the thing is people who don't are familiar with that checking mostly think things are either factor opinion or we check the facts and we leave and then fill out but to us the\nBigger the biggest thing that we work on is what I refer to as fact based opinion in other words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to correct they constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more of an art is kind of a ... you may there are kind of having such judgments that\nNot really a science more kind of an art it's kind of a cannon to editing you may there are kind of comments that's called judgments that you make and of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make common such judgments but you know we are journalists so\nUm when we shouldn't show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on and I'm like gosh I Believe you have a phone call scheduled at a chef of a Mexican restaurant long [laughter] [laughter] yeah the ... strain and\nSo we're I mean the plan and the plan was damn Daniel bread cliff jak of short restaurant reviewer tables for two and written by hand a gold field herself a former checks and\nShe was very pleased to hear you can check your face [laughter] way he'll see gas yeah Ken's\nEconomy and it's a short of view of a restaurant the Mexican restaurant called ... when we started a new checker we sit them down with a manuscript and have the underlying it for what they think is ... fact and what's not\nWould it be right to underline to details from like the the ingredients from the males\nYeah yeah stuff with old saying what does all held by seasonings seafood seasoning on so then she wants you to track that and that's the kind of thing you could both do off the website and then check was chef yeah Austin for your call is set up with an eleven\nYear while I'm going to say that Ron I collect she lay\nBack what she lived never heard of that dissimilar to beaches soup ...\nAnd you you also when when there's kind of like a negative judgment in there you with us back off and maybe enthusiasts\nLike lava China yeah well ... yeah well we want to be telling you that\nIt was so ... it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach aesthetic the problem with that is that that's a little if he says no it doesn't have a Venice Beach for something\nSo it's ... it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach aesthetic the problem with that is just absolutely if he says no it doesn't have a vendor speak idea for some reason he's offended by that formulation it's a it's her judgment so maybe you could just say like California beaches static um\nAfter you're done with this whole set of a job interview or to switch careers\nLike they have a much easier job right out there is pressure\nAfter I saw the ... I've had a good from quick grasp on what was ... was not I walked around the corner to have them work with Parker Henry another ... one of my deputy loosen\nOur time I talked to said look I'm when\nI'm you know the\nSmash so Parker and Daniel went to the Oxford multiple website where they looked at my news prices and photos of the restaurant\nYeah right on yeah yeah and you\nKnow I'm I was ... when I Lived in California for everyone it's called were seen as I Know [laughter]\nSo just because Parker and Daniel ... has the Venice Beach five doesn't mean that that's the way the chef smoker wouldn't describe it yeah\nI Know it's a fantasy so I don't know how are you\n[laughter] you can frame\nIt like you have no idea that it actually have access\nTo them um yeah playing down his key in on any city\nThat potentially offensive or get them um yeah playing down his key in on entity\nTo actually that [laughter] I'm okay how are eleven o'clock Paul is fast approaching okay I mean we did on speaker phone in the library on my cell phone\n[noise]\n\n[noise] Hi Justin I'm Down to a New Yorker I'm Wondering if you had a few minutes to an ... system some questions about there's a review of of your restaurant and I'm just trying to fact check it and make sure everything's accurate yeah of\nCourse so first off you'll surname is spelled a B.

power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young and irresponsible I was young and responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of a power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement\nIt's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt's sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of

men to anger historically toward toward good um [noise] what's that you often\n[noise] um it was an attempt to get my thoughts clear after the election I was um they'll take some doing oh God yes [noise]\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean\nI was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and\nUm there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women I was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been lingered by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think more clearly about race and class\nUm that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer and there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a podcast\nThere's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of

pushed to be better to think more clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer\nAnd there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a podcast\nWith a bunch of women and one of them had said about the white young white men who was the classic Bernie supporter like\nShe had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her\nWhere the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leaving be it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women to not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be foolish off you're right I understand and\nHave sympathy you with that like just let 'em right right and they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys without going in my own head\nAnd I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also think about white women\nAnd what impulses and messages are at work on white women\nPhyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be philosophically right I understand and have sympathy\nWith that like just let 'em right right you know they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys without going in my own head\nAnd I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also think about white women\nAnd what impulses and messages are at work on white women\nAnd um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of waiting is in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right I I and that was the question about my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here\nBut everything was so clouded [noise]\nAnd it was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that year says twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like I not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was like what was my work going to be professional professionally\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight dry is I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is the anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplar of constructive anger

music was rooted in Seoul and R. and B.\nAnd also punk a new wave and Monet wrote these kind of sigh concept album set in the future starring herself as an Android it was just kind of out there kind of weird sometimes and it could have been ridiculous except it wasn't it was great\nAnd Janelle Monday actually got the acclaim and recognition that you deserve [noise]\n\nMore recently she started acting seriously in film\nAs one of the stars of hidden figures and in moonlight and this year she released an album called dirty computer despite the title it's not science fiction at all she's dealing frankly with the issues that she's facing and that our country is facing\nRight this very moment she joined me in the studio and I wanted to begin at the very beginning\nSo at the New Yorker we have a whole fact checking department [laughter] so I Want to start with a fact checking thing should I read that as a kid you wrote an entire musical inspired by the Stevie Wonder album Journey Through the secret life of plants\nAll about photosynthesis what was it like what was this musical like\nWell my uncle was a huge Stevie Wonder fan and he played the album and then I was like oh we're learning about photosynthesis in our school\nAnd I started to just write about me 'cause I was living with my grandmother at the time we were in between houses and I started to write about me and just

imagination when you're that young\nWhen I was young I was really influenced because I ... I was with my family if you grow up in a big family like me I have over fifty first cousins swan or a mother had my grandmother had twelve children well and I have a huge family and so I was just with them a lot and I come from a musically inclined family\nMy great grandmother's are both play oriented piano what their churches um the church was it was a huge inspiration from the ...\nDid you sing in church the in the in a way that singers that I'm from an earlier generation to do with it or is it kind of grew up knowing the music of Sunday Morning on Saturday Night\nYou know I did sing in church but it's not the type of song that she was think would be sun in church it's not tradition ... no I actually was that five six year old kid\nWho would be sitting in the few and in my past her would be between yelling and sweating and about to get the holy ghost and I would bust out in the Michael Jackson to beat it and then I'd be escorted out to the children's church [laughter] kinda got kicked out\nYeah I was ... I was a rebellious Christian\nNow you're also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records in radio\nI did have access to musical theater

me\nNow at what point did you think I can have a big life like something that's beyond being in high school musical something beyond being a may be the best singer at your high school something larger than that\nI don't think I registered until I went to New York post high school I went to the American musical and dramatics academy\nAnd I started to learn more and I started to grow\nAnd when I realized that there was more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was an access\nPotential that was there and that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell fresher stories where we are heroes at that time Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration\nAnd I love Judy Garland yeah already on Judy Garland were were my my my heroes those are pretty different

often said to be a referendum on the presidency and that's never been more true than this year in the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff\nThat is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter a loss of Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania and what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state the thing that's foremost on people's minds\nIt was in the state of Pennsylvania and what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state the thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards\nAnd they're really unhappy about it one of the communities allies who visited was exton Pennsylvania in the suburbs of Philadelphia [noise]\nAccent is a place where two tectonic plates in American politics meat we saw Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and yell for al ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance go rogue\nWere on a leafy suburban street they're colonial houses which are made of brac inside and was final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five and she works in marketing\nHave you heard about running for office to now excused orange now you do okay well I actually live right on Devon drive and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here have been dealing with us\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fencing that marks the beginning of a controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party\nUm there are one two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within\nFive fifty feet in my backyard like\nOne two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within\nFive fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fear is Danielle with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impact how do your fears about an impact your life um [noise] it's horrible to\nThink about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in India for county in Pennsylvania and it was a smoker pipeline that was only a week old and so I actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\nOf like my babies like burning in her bed and I'm I called them and I said we have to move like you have to move we can't [noise] um\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there were only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless destroyed um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [noise]\nSo you know we're here trying to connect some of the dots between what's going on politically nationally\nAs well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics\nJust an example of the egregious ness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone let's put it this way\nAnd how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occur to me it just wasn't something\nLike maybe I thought it would run for school\nBoard or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are the people who represent us [noise] it's it's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nDaniels opponent and district one fifty five is Becky carbon a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve I reach representative carbon for an interview and she sent the following statement I Am a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community\nThen she listed her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\n[noise] but here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics are both the Republican legislature and the Democratic\nGovernor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking has made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state in America and and that's brought in a lot of different players including to know go and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline safety or kept priority for highly skilled engineers environmental scientist wildlife biology and geology design on pipeline to follow the safest wrong with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP as a private corporation that they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will\nWith the smallest environmental footprint\nATP is a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline moves natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the east to markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas\nWe were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop with a hundred miles west of action in the small town of blows or fail\nAt blooms gun shop when that Ralph and ...\nCliff wanted to get a taste of what fact checking was really like it made sense for him to come by the office and try his hand at here's Peter candy who runs the fact checking department\nSo they know Radcliffe showed up at my office shortly after town on a Monday morning along with Michael showman who writes about theater for the New York [noise]\nHi [noise] hello how are you and he didn't look unlike under ...\nAnd I wondered whether that had something to do with his intense immersion in the play where he plays a fact checker in a mortal combat where the where the difficult writer\n... because of because one of one of the\nPolicy to sort of the laws that live in I'm In a little bit in like ... and if I see a U.S know that if you can differentiate between ... one of the schools have things in life during the same job I have sort of gifts for whites to everything everything\nI mean the thing is people who don't are familiar with that second most of the things things are either factor opinion and we check the facts and we leave the finance alone\nBut to us the bigger the biggest thing that we work on is what I refer to as fact based opinion in other words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to crack they constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more kind of an art it's kind of it and the editing you may there are kind of comments that's called judgments that you make and of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make common such adjustments but you know we are journalists so\nUm when we shouldn't show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on and I'm like God I Believe you have a phone call scheduled at a chef of a Mexican restaurant not long at all I Need to train\nThem down so we're I mean the plan and\nSchedule but the chef of a Mexican restaurant long it'll ever leave that train down so we're\nI mean the plan and the plan was down

would us back off and maybe see a a state\nLaw or yeah well ... yeah well we want the Kennedy ...\nResearch to it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach aesthetic the problem with that is is that so that if he says no it doesn't have a Venice Beach for some reason he's offended by that formulation it's a it's her judgment so maybe you could just say like California speech static um\nNephew to end with this whole set of a job interview or to switch careers\nLike they have a much easier job right out less pressure\n[noise]\nSure to switch careers like they have a much easier job right out less pressure\nAfter I saw that Daniel ... had a good from of course grasp on what was ... was not I walked around the corner to have them work with Parker Henry another attractive

disturbed Nazi lore we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacist have been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what did the origins of it\nIt never really not exist but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely note that Democrat\nUm you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely know that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it but it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was for his campaigning for president he campaigned and give it a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why because he\nVoted for tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he beset firstly denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that these lines should exist\nSo what does what does Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve King is a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability and then just in the last couple of years partly because of Trump's and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there is no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kinda gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to Haiti doesn't delete them he kinda says oh this\nHe kinda gets called to the mat and says no I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to eat too doesn't delete them he kind of says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff\nBut he never walk back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you start at the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats than adding up than a than black and he predicts there'll be a greater number that whites that America I offered this panic then the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that\nOr I mean there are there are much more\nExtreme examples of his rhetoric than that but basically it's\nThat's kind of a turning the tables have saying by talking about ah you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that is therefore the racist Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forget how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says\nWe abhor racism so in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably washed their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is there a guy there not pulling funding from him at least not in a way that they're making public\nSo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan feel they cannot afford to reject somebody like king\nIt's terrifying it's yeah it means that they've read the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou've spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one\nTea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber predator fascism yeah unfortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're going to fascism and\nWhat does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't we weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure\nBut um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that you know yeah ... ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here\nI think we're now all starting to see that there is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are in extremely flawed\nSociety with a extremely a dicey racial history\nThat I'm perhaps a uniquely so among the countries we're talking about democracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to vote for the other guy\nThere is no guarantee that they want to vote for the other guy well let's talk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat and former baseball player named J. D. show the show and have a chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like\nHe's much taller so that's generally a good thing about sixty six six and he's driving around the district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king\nHe still down in the ... I mean incumbency is a very powerful thing in house elections and king has been there for six terms what's the district thing it's deep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but [laughter] um racism is not his only\nIt's deep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but racism is not the only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also says he wants to support farmers now he's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nNow that we live in the age of ... are there new politicians on the scene who seemed to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in a way they might not have\nBefore yeah I think someone like course Stewart he was someone who the Virginia a GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win but you know with this level of support he's doing better than one would expect I mean he\nHe won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments\nWe can't turn them down there our heritage he was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so [laughter] not the heart of the confederacy out of the confederacy and Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa sent a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so it's like gee I Wonder what that flag means to you\nIn New Jersey and the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman Seth gross was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap is that an outlier incident is that a very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of its extremist voices\nI think he I think the set Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more anomalous cases than that you have\nA guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the jets\nOne a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election\nIt's very scary that a literal Nazi is is running for office in Illinois and that and that this guy Seth Grossman is running for office in New Jersey but those are outliers I mean so I don't want to paint the picture that you know this is happening everywhere all the time\nAnd then the course of that discovered that Mike Flynn who was going to be the incoming national security adviser um had been having discussions with Mr Kislyak who was the Russian ambassador\nUm essentially imploring him not to do anything in response to those sanctions\nBut then the situation got a lot worse\nBecause people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer\nBut then the situation got a lot worse\nBecause people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer and others and ultimately come the culminating vice president Pence\nUm went out and were telling the American people that there had been no such discussions we knew because we had recordings of these conversations that we weren't the only ones who knew\nThat General Flynn was providing false information ostensibly to people in the administration who were then providing false information to the American people we weren't the only ones who knew that the Russians and do that too\nAnd because this had become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it suits or black males so what does what happened to 'em so I contacted Don McGahn who White House White House counsel 'em and told him that I needed to come see 'em right away\nTold him what we have learned that\nYou know the vice president a bit on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to a General Flynn personally and he is assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so\nYou got the VP out there saying this step so we told 'em Mr McGahn how we knew that it wasn't true how we happen to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nAnd and you go see him a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back and ... was a different are the same or what it was it was a little\nIn the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I\nYou know testified before the sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one\nDiscussion and I\nYou know testified before the sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official lies to another\nWhat did you make of that [noise] um well I tried to explain to him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official lying to another which God that would help people would be concerned about any way but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having\nThese discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this was a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence was entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood in you know in front of of the public that that wasn't true so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seventh also on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issue yeah um\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until there was this you\nKnow and and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at link\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order as you said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending this\nSo how did you find out about the travel ban um I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd I get a call I was able to keep one aide with may want us to my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so ... calls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the\nTop deputy the whole time and so ... calls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the New York times and it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of travel ban\nWe spent the weekend I'm trying to get our arms around and communicating with the White House um what is it that you're trying to do and\nBy Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality\nOf the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and it's been a very long time in there I'm Talking through what the challenges were what the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban\nWe talked about the different challenges by the constitutionally and statutory early and otherwise that have been filed [noise] um\nAnd at the end of that conversation\nI was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and\nWhat troubles me beyond that was it became clear that to defend the constitutionality of this I was going to have to send department of justice lawyers and to take the position\nThat this travel ban that applied just a Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion and\nThis was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and\nThat did not seem like the truth to me\nBut isn't it usually been job of a department of justice to defend actions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued that order or you're the president's you're the executive branch's lawyers\nPersonally would not have ... you know issued the order or you're the president's you're the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend this\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy ground perhaps the appropriate thing then to do would be to resign if you can't be part of that um but not directed department not to defend it but here's what's different is that\nI happen to believe ... should go into court and make an argument that it's not grounded and truth but the department of justice [noise]\nI mean [noise] if\nThe OJ stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do [noise]\nI knew that I personally couldn't be parked I'm defending this an argument something that that wasn't granted in ... um but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do is reside\nAnd that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this um but I was like just the head of the civil division or you know some other component of the department [noise]\nI was the acting attorney general of the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect not just my personal integrity but the integrity of the department of justice as well and I thought back to my confirmation hearing\nWhen I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions\nWho they were all over me and my confirmation hearing about\nWhat I Would do if the president asked me to do something that was on Wall for wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even if it's just something that would bring disrupt ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and will you saying that\nYou know even if it's just something that would bring disrupt ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and will you saying that\nYou know none of them were asking me will you resign they were asking me will you say no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign up so how did you say no they\nI mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just a communication\nThat we have a we had there were communications going on at levels below me and between me and Mr McGahn and I should the direct it to the department and then what happens [noise] um I was fired ...\nYou were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable [laughter] hired by Donald Trump\nDid that surprise you are or how did you think the story was going to end once you said you weren't going to allow the\nTravel ban to be defended look I certainly recognized there was a very real possibility for probability that I Would be fired in this in this context but I hoped\nThat maybe there was a chance that by doing this that would cause them to step back\nAnd take a breath and look at what they were doing and\nMore ... okay I Know everybody's got enough impolite so loud [laughter] and I was kind of silly now doesn't it um but you know I\nHarbor this hope that maybe they would step back they would have the kind of process they would get the kind of input on there would be real discussion about this um\nI had spent twenty seven years at the department of justice I loved that place um I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired\nThis I loved that place um I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired\nWhat what's your assessment of the whole series of events\n[noise] um\nI suppose you could say that the president and made a campaign promise and he was making good on that promise but beyond the fact that I Believe that particularly the first one was a lawful and unconstitutional I think it's\nAbsolutely the antithesis of who we are as a country and\n[noise]\nListening to sell you a long time Justice Department official who is the acting attorney general at the start of the Trump Administration Sally ate spoke with Jeffrey to even at the New York [noise]\nI\n\nNext [noise]\nBuying them down and they didn't know you know when\nThe New Yorker radio hour is supported by the wall Street Journal providing news and insights about global markets

lines of ... or ... other time she sounds like a minute vocalist along the lines of Janet Jackson you\nThere's a real intelligence and her amusing and ...\nOf Janet Jackson you know\nThere's a real intelligence in her amusing and points to someone who really understand and appreciate a machine or says of her own music and also kind of implicates where that music my go in the future\nSo we talk and then she also gave an incredible live performance along with one of her producers indigent Lawrence [noise]\nThank you so much for being here with us for the Nineteen New Yorker festival and for the talk [noise]\n\nFirst of all I have immense respect for any singer performer anybody who goes with just the first name as a power move as far as I'm concerned [laughter]\nCan you do how did you decide you know how you present yourself in that way\nWell I was really committed to the full\nName calling it on ... and stuff I I really wanted to be known first and last mhm and everybody was like\n... and and you're going to run into issues when people try to search her name is\nYeah very strong from this angle either [laughter] um yeah I Know you grow up in the DC area there was a thriving culture of music or the things you were listening to have the worst starting to perform and um to to start writing songs how did that all those influences coming together\nUm you know it's it's really weird because you know\nI feel like I'm grown up in a really ... it's an intersection experience\nI feel like I'm grown up in a really ... it's\nAn intersection only experience you know there's a lot of things going on at the same time you know I'm I'm a daughter of immigrants of African immigrants East African immigrants particularly if he opens and then there's the layer of\nGrowing up in a suburb\nOf DC I'm I'm being bussed from a you know ghetto suburb\nTo a wider suburb and what that means you know um there's a particular way that you're processing the world when your school is extremely segregated I Would say that's the case for everybody but there's a way it was happening in my school\nSo I was listening to a lot of different things you know I was obsessed with with armed be any harm the local was just that was like zero those home base\nAnd I would say before that I was listening to jazz and in world music and just you know a lot of traditional music\nAnd then I remember my ex boyfriend my first boyfriend had a Napster membership one of the first\nOh well we were all and I got now during the divorce you know I kept that membership\nFor a few years to survey every female\nVocal period I was just on a mission to just scan the world for every single type of thing and and so I just would learn music and other languages but mainly jazz you know that was the thing that I was sort of serving the most and\nUm so you know I've had different periods where I was just\nImmersed in one sound um and then after that it was sort of a really experimental\nDifferent periods where I was just\nImmersed in one sound um and then after that it was sort of a really experimental music you know so electronic and experimental music when I think about my experimental electronic music side a lot of those references are still black\nBecause I'm thinking about Jared Diamond Terry Louis or I'm thinking about both the comments or you know I'm just in her mouth Davis or Herbie herpes\nWhat was it about or and be made it sort of a\nSudden we're kinda more droughts worse in some ... some pool on you\nUm I guess it was just pop music that was you know there's a way that you know\nYou can't there's there's no ... around\nUm jazz when you get to your elementary school\n[laughter] for jobs will now where you want to be around me out and get the kindergarten and people like you know ... you know [laughter] like that so\nI'm yeah I think that is just the pool it's the thing that happens to every him is long hair and being when they see Michael Jackson for the first time or when they see\n'em you know when they hear Mariah or just any of those sort of bank huge artists will have that pull you know\nUm but you know my love for jazz never never died [noise]\n... no\nStill get\nHe\nIn the\n\n\n\n[noise]\nIn jazz is part of what you're supposed to do is reinterpret the standard you know that's how you get good so for me I always just
