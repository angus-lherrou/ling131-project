ninth of October is always to have your long everybody we will get to the purple and gold\nQuestion of the day in a little bit but we're going to take a couple of the dominance themes of the day today as we get going that would be Wall Street consumer spending terrorists also the ever important idea of economic growth\nEnroll them into our lead story ready here goes Wall Street was lousy today in part because of a report that the Trump Administration is getting ready to impose taxes on the other half of everything the United states imports from China that we don't already have terrorists on but\nAnd we've got new figures on consumer spending this morning we\nStates imports from China that we don't already have terrorists on but and we've got new figures on consumer spending this morning we consumers that is spent more for the seventh straight month last month\nAnd that's indirectly I'll admit gets the marketplaces ... shore and where one imagines things go from here\nWith consumer spending more and more and more for the past seven months without wages ramping up you might wonder whether some kind of issue is going to drop\nThere's no reason to believe that if there were spending is poised for a materials slowdown\nJames Bond agrees with economic forecasting firm I just market GDP Growth was three point five percent in the third quarter faster than economists were expecting\nThe state of the consumer is pretty much the best it's been in in decades and you know that's characterized by low unemployment rising income um and then the tax cuts of course\nThis is despite slow wage growth Alan ... is an economist at UPS\nWith all these and overall income growth just because people have been putting in more hours we've been having more people being hired even though the wages for individuals have been going up rather modestly they're starting to pick up for now\nAs long as jobs keep getting created consumer spending should be strong so what might threaten jobs well tariffs for one\nOver the next six months or so it's likely that we will see some flowing in employment and income as firms take a wait and see attitude on the tariffs and the tariffs slowly by and on the economy start re priced\nStill ... expects that to be temporary some firms will suffer some will fail others will adapt Richard ... is an economist with Wells Fargo and company he says there's a threat to employment and spending closer to home\nWe've got growing headwinds in the form of higher interest rates are reservists raised with great several times over the past years\nAnd if those rates continue to go up that could be it\nThat lives in the form of higher interest rates are reserved has raised with great several times over the past years\nAnd if those rates continue to go up that could be a drag on home sales in auto loans next year in New York I'm Rebecca shore for marketplace once upon a time IBM stood for international business machines but somebody hasn't made any actual machines in years since he got rid of its hardware divisions it's been selling to things to business customers\nSoftware and services and today the company took another big step in that direction big blue is spending thirty four billion dollars\nTo acquire the open source software and cloud computing from red hat it is the biggest acquisition IBM's ever made\nA bet on the big market for cloud computing marketplaces ... has that one\nWe all know there are different types of clouds in the sky right strategies clouds are closer to the ground in serious clouds are way up there will cause for data work the same way companies put some info and servers far away but not all of it came forest at Fort pitch capital says sometimes you need the info lightning quick\nIt was over in China over in Europe you don't know where the cloud really is all that back and forth takes too long so you have to have stuff close to you like the guy to your business\nHaving some clouds close in some far is called hybrid cloud that requires the different clubs to talk to one another and red hat make software to do that it's a big reason IBM bought the company together redhead and IBM hope to take on the big big boys in cloud computing Amazon and Microsoft has Chris gardener at Forrester Research\nThis is a a proactive approach to say look we don't want to be in their shadow when it comes to go out we want to be the first one player\nIBM hasn't been first that much lately Michael ... what the Sloan School of management at MIT says big blue came late to mobile computing and then the cloud now it's trying to catch up\nYou know it's still an important company but it's not a growth company\nTo mobile computing and then the cloud now it's trying to catch up\nYou know doing important company but it's not a growth company anymore it's a shrinking company the big challenge for the c._e._o. JD rom it is to figure out how to grow again\nThis is a pricey batch thirty four billion dollars for red hat is sixty three percent more than what the market thought the company was worth on friday I'm Scott Tong for marketplace\nAs I said speaking of markets Wall Street was lousy today not as lousy as it could have been though will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\nHere's a story about getting what you pay for or more accurately getting what you don't pay for you don't have to spend a lot of time driving around almost anywhere in this country\nTo know that our infrastructure our road specifically are in bad shape typically the money to maintain and sometimes even improve those roads comes from gas taxes California is one of several states that increased it gas tax not too long ago to get more money\nTo make more repairs but as often happens with new taxes not everybody is happy about 'em and they have taken to the ballot with the anti tax proposition six coming to California voters a week from tomorrow\nBut as much Jed Kim reports now from the streets of LA changes in what kinds of cars are on the road might make a real gas tax difference\nHe line Lippmann has brought me to the corner of Venice in ... in downtown LA\nIt's next to the convention center people center\nAnd I would highway highway yeah the one way or I didn't hear the noise coming through I'm\nLiving in is with the transportation organization called LA\nHe's against proposition six because he says the gas tax is necessary\nPoints out the ...\nThe transportation organization called ... LA\nHe's against proposition six because he says the gas tax is necessary\nPoints out the ... in the paper\nYou got a big fire a couple of big bottles here\nLipman says the state has a backlog of a hundred thirty billion dollars in infrastructure investment in roads and bridges\nRoads that are less safe bridges that are less safe\nAnd we are art investing in the states and the way that we need [noise]\nLast year California legislators decided to patch that hundred thirty billion dollar hole\nBy raising the state's tax on gasoline from Eighteen cents a gallon to thirty cents\nAlmost immediately a group formed to put forward proposition six to overturn the increase and require all future hikes to be approved by voters rather than legislators\nCalled the ... is chairman of the yes on prop six campaign he blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money\nSo we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it\nBut even if the gas tax word stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these Texas haven't been indexed to inflation\nAnother reason to be seen directly across that street\nIn downtown LA at a Honda dealership\nIts windows advertise hybrids another fuel efficient cars\nKrista Ghouta is out on the law joking with other salesmen\nI ask him how many people come in looking for good mileage most of it that\nTank got nine customers coming for the end of the of course they look in a way to get\nAnd they're fighting it some vehicles top out it over fifty\nMiles to the gallon for people maybe\nHad to buy you know five

uh four or five like minded shoulders and screams all the ... of course I'm with this phone you can or the best guess is would you regret\nThat's true of course I'm with this and you can or the best guess as I said you regret\nThe way that the the building is designed is the the the basketball courts are at the center of the building and when you know when you hear the basketball's it's kind of like the heartbeat of the building and um so now we're walking as if oh so there you go you know we are one of the players\nSo you're waiting rooms with the training room right of course are over there the beautiful weight rooms and drove so this is a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the players right this is where the rubber meets the road um so what keeps you up at night but what's your worst [laughter]\nMy ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us\nAnd and be part of what we're building and we've missed the playoffs every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to it in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that on there\nI I don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask you a little brown and ... and Magic Johnson drug for basketball and and you know ... and the other best brokerage of you guys had the conversation on yourself about look\nThis isn't going to be rebuilding\nUm yeah you you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations what I felt was and why I had to make the ...\nWhat we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations what I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball was that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we had three coaches and three years\nYou know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are more complex all the time you were in ... and and not only does regular business with them through new show true to the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose forced to write uncertainty was going\nWas killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground losing the oh yeah you know up to like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I ask him how long is it going to take you to get the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized it wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite kid [laughter] people ask me [laughter]\nMy dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite kitt [laughter] on the last\nWord here about your family right I mean Dr closer to your brother who work with and then and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book you talked about it in interviews about how this is a family business [laughter] show those first couple of years when the commercial read culture and says don't blow it with a family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nIt was very very difficult um\nYou know my dad kinda set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in the question about it and making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years did you wait too long\nThat was the my first comment publicly was I Apologize to Laker fans because ... perhaps I did wait too long\nUm as you can hear the music or early ... it's it's funny because we actually have a DJ now on staff you know because yeah it's like these young players they they're used to multitasking there used to having music\nWhile they're doing whatever let me show you\nBecause yeah it's like these young players they they're used to multi tasking there used to having music while they're doing whatever\nLet me show you don't get out of your [noise] it's good to know your way around the wrong way\nOkay this is my ... one and I mean actually this is the trophy room I just happened on my desk in here and so I don't ever\nGoing to be this close to them to be a tribute to probe that's cool it's seven\nSo that the reason you know it it was important the trophies were displayed so that the players ... ... this is the inspiration\nAnd we overlook record and if they look up here they will see these trophies hanging around\nNow here's a great feature wow or me\nIs that are actually ... have the balcony\nThis is nice right after we got here is just going to watch this work yup that the war room old our that we were the

Richardson from Edward Jones and Catherine Rampell from Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody okay\nSo let me start with you uh and and uh in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a Tracey Samuelson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report\nWilson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report has deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the boost to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the nuns and we're seeing a slow down I'm so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nMeal it it occurs me actually just thinking back to open the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the ... because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the ... stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's boil it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger growth and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow\nBut inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking in its good as Katherine said because the consumer is good I I hear some trepidation though in your voice new\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persisting concerns slower global growth higher interest rates\nAnd ... concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead okay Katherine nuts\nPush pulling the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears leaving wipe them out well well uh [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and tariffs and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars in the United states because of all these are not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those terrorists but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been so like basically in the same breath a you know on the one hand he saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he's saying the terrorists don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know I when I've talked with\nA business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact that Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nWhat other item from the wall Street Journal interview and and ah one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed uttered budget ... his biggest ah economic problem I'm even as a German ... told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with the president says one does wonder if\nYou know with some signs\nGerman ... told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with President says one does wonder if now with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about raids what does this kind of pressure you suppose due to the motive ...\nWell you know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what that is really concerned about is how they keep the economic\nBull market running how to keep economic growth in and stop lung still normalizing policy because winning us and we know that it will be aware and eventually the neck and recession hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is this fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political ... political realization of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that's what a has to be negotiated going for a port\nBill Richardson a at the end we're Jones Catherine Rampell the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you\nThink ... thanks guys\nHave a nice weekend on Wall street today down day that ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think like the fourth time as we said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up they go down but it has been a while since things have felt this chopping run will have the details when we do the numbers\nIn\nIn\nWhen we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\n\n\nAll right back we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine and you'll and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due\nBut you dig a little deeper as we want to do around here and you could start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drags last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent\nAt the end of you know is chief us economist at ... and the global\nWhat you saw was exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shapes nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth but he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays\nThey may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter ... now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which analyzed transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has ... for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about\nFor example Ford has estimated that trust\nTax reform for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher steel prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact of starting to bite\nIs marketplace I'm tired result there's one gets filed street into the I totally did not know that folder but you know the day that gets stored up in the cloud as the saying goes well it turns out all the big tech companies Amazon Google all the big ones they back up their cloud servers on magnetic tape\nIt seems so old school right but there is a problem and it's not what the tape just two companies make the tape that a big chunk of the Internet is backed up onto and each wants the other out of the\nRight but there is a problem and it's not what the tape just two companies make the tape that a big chunk of the Internet is backed up onto and each wants the other out of the business Susan Decker has the ... reporter for Bloomberg walk in the program\nYeah how are you doing today guy I'm well thank you are but I I I Will be completely honest and tell you that I read the story and I said they're still using tapes for cloud backup explained to me how this works\nIn the old school sometimes is that the storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server but you when you need long term archival storage you want something separated from the Internet and you want something that's going to uphold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in\nAnd the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because\nIt's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and its stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah Gen cheapest important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah ... terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single LTS seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes that's about Fifteen million books

Washington deals with at a policy\nLevel few of them bring with them more wailing and gnashing of teeth then these two seemingly simple words currency manipulation the subject comes up every six months Treasury Department is required to put out a report listing those economies that are manipulating their currencies to gain competitive advantage but really here\nWe are talking about one economy right China that as we told you last week the Treasury Department did not repeat not say Beijing is manipulate\nWe're talking about one economy right China and as we told you last week the Treasury Department did not repeat not say Beijing is manipulating its currency\nBut that did not end the wailing and the national over the weekend treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he might actually consider changing the rules the department uses to decide whether countries are playing fast and loose with the foreign exchange markets so we asked marketplaces Tracey Samuelson why all the for X held up\nAs far as current global economic issues go currency manipulation no super high unless\nThis is not something that very many countries have done historically and not something many countries are doing today\nDavid Steinberg is a professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins [noise] but if you worry as the president does that other countries so more to us than we do to them then you worry about the ways that exchange rates can make those foreign goods even more appealing Matthew Goodman is with the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThere is a close relationship between currency and trade policies\nThing is that China isn't currently devaluing its currency for competitive advantage\nThey don't you know clearly meet the test of manipulation at the moment\nAnd anyway the label just doesn't pack that much punch they'll ... at the University of Maryland\nIs kind of a strange tool because if we deemed China to be a currency manipulator the result of that is and we have to have talks with China about it but of course we're talking with them already\nThen there's the politics Derek scissors with the American Enterprise Institute\nRemember the president said he recalled trying to crunch him and I put on day one we've now gone through four rounds of reports where they haven't called the courage to manipulate or and you know there are

with a new number new product if you will something called ultra psycho for people who don't have much of a credit history to begin with\nOr who maybe didn't have the greatest credit in the past marketplaces replenish or has more now on who stands to gain from that\nIf you don't have a credit history it's kind of hard to get a credit score like it's hard to get a grade class if you've never taken any of the tests so what if I go is doing instead with ultra psycho is looking at other information besides your credit history to figure out how credit worthy you are\nThat includes not having a history of negative balances having savings and trains acting response\nSally Taylor is scores vice president at by go she says you have to volunteer this information willingly it's not automatic there are fifty three million people in the U.S who don't have a credit score students are immigrants for example\nIt's cooler will tap into another ten to Fifteen now and we estimate that fifty three

thousand Eighteen congressional elections a lot of it coming from\nWell shall we say the upper end of the income distribution marketplace adjusting how has that one one\nOf the reasons there's so much money flowing into these midterm elections is because billionaires alleging more of their cash and politicians\nThis is something that sort of arose out of in the dark as fortunate as being made\nOr the last few decades\nThat stand for political scientist Adam Monica he found that the total wealth the force four hundred jumped eleven to fold since Nineteen eighty two and the amount will be people spend on politics has gone up in proportion historically he says\nPretty clear that there was a lot more money coming from very wealthy conservative\nLike casino mogul Sheldon Adelson he's worth

the opening of an embassy in Jerusalem\nThis year it'll send and his wife if pony up eighty seven million dollars to conservative groups and candidates but lately Monica says many billionaires are leaning another way\nAnd over time it's been trending pretty clearly towards more money going the darkest\nConservative candidates have earned more billionaire donations the data from the center for Responsive Politics show Democrats are catching up but like I says that's because a lot of newer billionaires come from more liberal places like Silicon Valley\nDustin Moskowitz the billionaire cofounder of Facebook gave over five million to groups like move on dot org and a group dedicated to winning Senate races others say the polarized political climate over the last two years his letting more people in general to contribute\nI feel this is an emotional need for people to engage\nThat's ... next Gen America that's the political action committee run by one of the biggest democratic

Politics a huge chunk of the spending goes to advertising and depending on what the ads say she says their funders don't always have to be disclosed\nSo it makes it hard to tell whether it's a billionaire spending or a corporation or anyone else\nSo to the to the other half of the question then why did the Federal Communications commission let Sinclair do this show many times\nIs no simple answer to that I mean the the FCC comes under a lot of criticism for allowing too much consolidation has been a problem under both Democratic and Republican administrations um they have allowed a number of enormous monopoly\nConsolidation has been a problem under both Democratic and Republican administrations\nUm they have allowed a number of enormous monopolies to form now I should say that I'm In the late nineties the FCC did investigate Sinclair for this a sort of fraudulent divested ... strategy\nThey ended up finding that Sinclair had violated some of these rules and they were not making good faith truly independent divested jurors and um they find the company race herself forty thousand dollars which is really not a lot of money to a large corporation like Sinclair\nA word here in defense of the Federal Communications commission or Sinclair has one of the Tribune media for a while they had a deal and just recent well a number of months ago but recently in relative terms or the German the FCC ... pi should innocence I'm not going to let that happen\nThe Tribune merger was sort of a fascinating little window into the business in regulatory environment that has sprung up under President Trump there was this real sense that the merger would just get waved through because Trump is a big supporter of Mr Smith and if Sinclair and he was tweeting positive statements about the company\nAnd several weeks ago I G pie announced while we're not going to approve this deal we have major concerns in effectively killed the deal referred it to a legal hearing within the FCC which sort of do that\nBut what we've learned since then has Sinclair was basically behaving in such a way that it was a foregone conclusion they did not even make minimal effort\nTo appease their regulators and get their deal approved\nAnd they had had such success for such a long period of time to refer to be over in their favor\nThe trick had worked in the past and the number of regulatory experts I spoke with said well it's sort of one thing to try and pull off that trick with the shame divested ... when you're a much smaller company but once you are the largest company in the country
