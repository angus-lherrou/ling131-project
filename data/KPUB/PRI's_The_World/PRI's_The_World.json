communist society Irish and have a clear\nHierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party\nAnd even he was the same generation has a state leaders Chairman Mao drawn islands of

is very good argument\nDid they resist ... yeah they they told me they said you'll find that doesn't just\nBeen onto your family you know which is very good argument and they say a recent belongs to

atmosphere gets us closer to that point\nScientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon and the process just builds on itself\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and our own civilizations\nI ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop this experiment we're conducting on the Arctic

a bit I'm Still working with with a native ... and getting out the vote I Know standing voted ... is a campaign geared toward native populations in the U.S and in a a big part of it it has to do with

come to this room to\nSo she seemed\nTo kind of education and the way it listen let's talk peacefully come here come to this room gets by ourselves sometimes alleged tool it we know now that he respects for very very much the situation the relationship between the two countries I think is um\nIs quite good Jefferson how does it feel in Berlin yeah I I Would pretty much agree with\nThat I mean I think I'm Greece's lot smaller than Germany so it doesn't command or attention here probably as much as we command their\nAttention there but I think this sense is that you know the Greeks has done a pretty good job of trying to get their economic problems under control they basically done what's the Germans have asked to them and that they should be given a break and of course\nYou know I'm going to medical has much bigger problems with some other European leaders you know I mean compared to like Victor all bond in Hungary you know I'm a going out for a meal with the prime minister

and then last year he bought a helped launch Mexico's first professional women's soccer league reputation was well known a tireless advocate for girls and women in sports\nLast month he bought it was

no problem thank Kate\nIt's been three weeks we're still trying to unravel the mystery of Saudi journalist ... disappearance and suspected murder the Saudi Arabian authorities denied having anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as a result of a fight\nFew are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... by the president has been reluctant to do that in part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs maybe more than that and we'd be very hurtful to this country if we said oh we're not going to sell it to you\nSo how many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis\nArms and security analyst William Hartung studies weapons sales at the center for international policy we'd like you to crunch the numbers for as you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that clip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia [noise]\nWell it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nSince then it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nEven if they you know decided to get rid of some deals that made under Obama we'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not six hundred thousand or even a million which he said or the other day as well you know in the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed\nIt's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory or things are built that are being sold to the Saudis it's a different matter but it's\nFor our economy as a whole it's certainly not much and certainly not a reason to arm of murderous regime that's not only kill the journalists but is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saudi contracts Boeing and Raytheon you're saying that this contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the Saudis paid for\nThere was some big here in the Obama period\nWhere they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all in a couple of packages so not all of us have gone through but after ... fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened and those were worth tens of billions of dollars some of that money is already flowed they've started delivering the fifteenth\nSo the money is water under the bridge since that's already been spent we're not going to see it again that would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's in mid flow because allegedly they need these systems so what's actually on the table that might change is the deal for a missile defense system called fab\nWhich was introduced during the Trump period and they've got to agree on the details so in theory the Saudis can say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to ... that in China or Russia would pick up any of the business\nSaudi Arabia's whole military is built on us in UK supplied weapons communications and maintenance and spare parts it would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us\nAnd you have supplied weapons communications maintenance and spare parts it would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production and how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much of that is reliant on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spends accounts for about three and a half percent of our entire economy\nAnd not all that as weapons and then the Saudi peace is a tiny fraction of that less than a tenth of a percent I Would say so it's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginal it's it's really important and very specific places where a particular bomb is built for a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump wheels out numbers that actually aren't totally accurate but if you had to guess why do you think he would be bringing those numbers way way up\nI think partly he likes to show himself in sort of a master dealmaker who's getting the best deal for the American people in the American worker and you can see that as trade policy as well\nBut also I think he's trying to change the conversation away from the crimes of the Saudi regime because he wants to team up with them a and going after Iran\nIs built and then walk heads the ... circuit polar council and Alaska based in Anchorage but she grew up in ... and she says until a hundred years or so ago there was no permanent village on Sarah chef island her ancestors lived all along this part of the coast and they use the island frequently but they didn't live here year round\nAnd that's the thing that they were kind of semi nomadic um we didn't have permanent settlements and that sort of thing\nBut all of that changed in the early Nineteen hundreds when the U.S government and the Lutheran Church came to coastal Alaska and build churches and schools\nIt was an extension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states Alaska Native people were told they had to send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taken away over time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah chap island\nSo this thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a storm comes at it and forces them off that land um this year\nThat's Joel climate again at the Interior Department he set out to get federal agencies to help protect people in coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate\nThis year that's Joel climate again at the Interior Department he set out to get federal agencies to help protect people and coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate change\nHis breath and other towns were already engaged in planning your own solutions but the sticking point was money moving a whole town is a complicated and expensive affair one federal study pegged the cost of living ... at a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars\nAnd ... doesn't have that kind of money they don't have any kind of money actually forty percent of people live below the poverty line many homes don't have running water but Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept the human caused climate change is even real\nSo finding dollars was very difficult we did manage to get some grant money and some grant programs blowing up but the boys just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the bearing sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic communities respond to climate change climate was optimistic that would finally bring meaningful action for ...\nAnd he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nFrankly despite all the anti climate change rhetoric of these new folks uh I wasn't worried about climate change adaptation because ... you know you're\nYou're addressing issues that are very clear in front of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory it's fact and of course uh I was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration President Trump revoked Obama's executive order the project was dead\nIt was a clear shot across the bow even have a doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing\nTo Obama's executive order the project was dead\nIt was a clear shot across the bow that have a doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or protecting people imperil anything that has a with climate change to it ah has to stop\nThen a few months later Clemens got reassigned to a totally unrelated job for which he had no qualifications and he wasn't alone\nWhen I found out that dozens more senior executives like me had been reassigned I realized that it was I was part of a purge\nClimate found a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote an op ed in the Washington Post and started speaking publicly about what's at stake not just his and his colleagues jobs but the people of many coastal Alaskan communities\nI mean government should be scrambling to try and find ways and dollars to get people out of harm's way and find innovative ways to do that it's what government does and that's what's appalling about this\nWhat would you say to people who are like um well it's your problem why should the state of Alaska or the federal government or anyone else help you if you need two hundred million dollars to move go find two hundred million dollars and good luck to you\nYeah well they'll they'll be saying the same thing to Miami pretty soon right so I mean what happens up there\nAre in the face of climate change is an important bellwether for what's gonna happen and the rest of the coastal areas of the United states right I mean we're all American citizens and we have some expectation that we're not on her own right and and that's one of the things that makes this country great\n[noise]\nI reach out twice to the department of interior for comment but they did not respond\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo given how tenuous the situation is why don't people just leave ... like if they can't relocate the whole

known are fair banks or Seattle\nThat's a that's a cultural death to these communities each one of these villages is its own distinct culture their own distinct dialect to ask them to just assimilate into another village somewhere a is to ask them to let go their culture entirely which I think it's just\nHorrible [noise] everyone I met in ... seem to agree on this they want to stay together people

S. for asylum one of those is obviously family separation what are the others\nWell the reason that the Trump Administration was separated families was not just to be cruel it wanted to detain all asylum seekers indefinitely\nIf you're detaining refugees only based on their migration status and they don't present any kind of risks of society or viscous lean that constitutes arbitrary detention

them to wait there we also found that the U.S authorities had been encouraging Mexican immigration officials to deport those asylum seekers back to the very countries where they fled persecution or threats of death and that's flat illegal under both US law and international law\nSo they're these three interlocking policies and since we released a report both Republican and democratic members of

grandson so you don't get deported without um so what you see here is a clear threat of permanently separating the grandmother from her grandson at the threat of being deported without him\nAnd what

against the military regime including my uncle was one of the four hundred and thirty four people who were disappeared and killed during that time\nOh my gosh I mean it doesn't sound like something Brazil really wants to repeat so what do you think it is about that period that some people in Brazil are nostalgic for that seems to be resonating when ... talks about it\nWell I think the main issue is that Brazil never reckon with its military dictatorship past and the military controlled the process of transition from dictatorship to democracy\nIn Nineteen Seventy nine they passed this abroad amnesty law that prevented anyone involved in human rights\nViolations working for the regime to be prosecuted for eternity so unlike Argentina or Chile Brazil never prosecuted to military bowl and the dictatorship that military involved in the extrajudicial killings and the torture\nSo Brazilians have developed this idea that there was a time without crime without economic problems and I think

extremely brave of these women who have come forward media is those who've been supportive but\nThere's also mean is more criticism off some of the ... some of the women coming forward and there is

nostalgic for that seems to be resonating when ... talks about it\nWell I think the main issue is that Brazil never reckon with its military dictatorship past and the military controlled the process of transition from dictatorship to democracy\nIn Nineteen Seventy nine they passed this abroad amnesty law that prevented\nAnyone involved in human rights violations working for the regime to be

different is that people are talking about that they may end up coming forward I think that is a big move and there is much more of the nation that you cannot just lie down and take it I think for me as an Indian woman this is a big change it has taken a very long just a real like vision that this is a\nProblem and that this has to be dead\nAs debate and each one of us have to come forward and do
