own noting it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country jak rose in his presidency the American Jewish Congress\nJak words fail you know we're so sorry about this route to community\nBut has this been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nLike first thought is this is a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tech not only the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was\nJews have been living in America comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country she changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities\nAnd here we are again one more time\nOr the ugliness not only pop to the surface does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in America\nWell uh ... let's talk\nDoes that does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in America\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred Jews make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the country's religious hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous here have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols on Jewish cemeteries schools the SAT on Saturday there's quite a shock to the community and to America is seems\nAnd you know we all have these silly gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out I Hope you're feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know it's a small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize so political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe as those that have been spewing out some of his viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system\nYou know the answer to this or a political leaders\nParties and maybe that will send a message in shock the system\nYou know the answer to this or a political leaders they have the microphones most important political leaders of president as a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are man governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize yeah with a loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it still do go to to the polls is necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nWell and actually some would say we're hearing the opposite from the president had been\nFor a while we know that the gunman in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by those marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that Jews are pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches it's hard to hear but let's listen to these marches again in Charlottesville\n\nSound from a documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly shouting in the synagogue that had to be chilling\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of the wrong time being set in America I Know everyone\nCharleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of the wrong time being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having\nA big responsibility in this because of you know his views and his political rhetoric we should all work hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to been watching Clinton sharpening show no TV yesterday\nHas shocked and I know yeah\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's been showing you the wrong tone has been setting and I said to myself what about ...\n... you're speaking of ... leader of the nation is on\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why and she was speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and\nTrump's Republican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against\nYou know hatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold president a little more responsible you know he has to since he has the biggest microphone she's going to have to\nUh you know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties wall leaders don't just get a pass\nThem around town said that they were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville and you got permission half as much and I don't think\nThat you can talk about Nazis and the all white and Americans I just don't think that comparison makes you know\nAny sense to ten of us Americans\nCan't claim president as an act of Congress thanks so much in again since ...\nThank you for your time\n... president of American Jews Congress thanks so much and again so sorry for the last in your community\nThank you for your kind of thoughts appreciate the time to be able to express views of the Jewish community\n\nWell

trying to get on and it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together to goodness focus last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flattery O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from Jay I'm ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the married his apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve [noise]\nDo know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through\nUh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other and he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought well that seems odd but\nI Am so glad to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that would happen well\nWhen the when the shots started the injection to you know put him to sleep the\nOther dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and picked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating they and then he did more afterwards\nOr as I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought on to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's ... chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something's gonna happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life when you thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of that is a dog I mean he's he's her whole emotional life during this period\nSomebody asked for the party argue the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle memory but also if you are a writer and this narrator is\nArgue the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle memory but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person who in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain writers and certain books in certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google especially Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities in what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of ...\nThe children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nBoy could be both ... or maybe the friend is the narrator yeah\nAnd what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my ... my married are really does that this is something I definitely share with my married or she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that to our cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet but can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend yeah\nDogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that she\nThat she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head as they do you have her only solace is that she is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her\nIf the cat was still trying to you know with a pen wake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and so they just have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle a story to the ground\nThe piece of advice that I really like is the simple don't flinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft because they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but\nWhen they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it and that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city":

provoked worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping of more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory\nIn the middle of the night\nThen what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released\nTheir stories told in the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram it airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer ... with us as Well hi Sasha ... he said the girls that we first meet in your ...\nEdwards welcome high and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha ... so the girls that we first meet in your documentary are the ones who were released by Boko Haram and living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we always see secure the access with the government's consent is the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the bells about what happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram why am partly a\nI mean they was you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them in that governments safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks\nSo it was quite well they um with still processing what had happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us we're not counselors to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBut he couldn't be any time we were alone with the girls the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government also I wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because they were held a three is the full ... down and they were released\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity what would what it was like\nThey they um they was free to speak to his they did give us that diaries discreetly it and they kind of\nWell they they um low they was free to speak to his they did give us the diaries discreetly ... and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they called us and the full Boko Haram treatment ... uh and in the film when we do is the uh the girls that you book goes who have taken was actually just the tip of the iceberg there were thousands of girls in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us\nWalked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the testimony we get a sense of what happened to the to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the film is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier for you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave then you know life is not taught us or it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the golf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met had like she\nShe did tell us I don't love\nHi when I ran away and when we first met ... like she she did tell us I don't love my baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have disappeared who have either been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay well ... has been conducting children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fights\nAnd then when the military engaged with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill and harassed or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been cannot but they've just flooded their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah it is functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns and these they call them id Pete comes a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run to his Boko Haram you know they don't just could not then button and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of a one of the the main town\nThen the and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of a one of the the main pounds is incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on that whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that's why you have to them\nAnd their their outcomes but then a lot of the uh loves internally displaced people end up living within the community so\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they will have been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory is in a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize control the Nigerian military and\nTheir constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night that happened to be the end of Ramadan\nThat was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know\nWho to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into bits of the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line ... ... you just don't know why this right it's coming from and where and when I said there's a lot of mistrust\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and try to have a hopeful future or the government\nThose who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and trying to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including a some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your film\nI Know him when he doesn't eat everything has changed my life [noise] now out of the nation I mean ... even though right ... [noise]\nDo you see a bright future for some of these girls yes\nI think ah for the ... girls who are are in a un if the American university that you're not the American University in Nigeria which is well older but girls who were released a negotiated full and uh the escaped goes who on the nights that uh\n...

the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair\nFox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content here's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy ...\nMore on Fox has only ... what do we fought for skin they listen to ... take on prime time with a five minute we can't we can't say whether they live for Sunday Sunday edition sponsored by Google ...\nHearing now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind us\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes in many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots\nAnd they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nRight let's take this first change Fox is calling it the night and he's nine second sixty seconds ... nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jackpots what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually eighty second you're does have got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nIs that also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand that content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's just\nThe spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and ah and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in primetime by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this sort of\nFinancial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain it's All right\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile ride sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThey're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nWell I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have ...\nCars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost two hundred fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about this specific how get around works are right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYes so you ... you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nOn lock the doors and Dr ... and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attest led to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's ... ah which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a mass of opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards acts\nDollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access the more this market grows for all players\n... well some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said\nThat those companies sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent what do you what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nYeah so I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen in and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely on ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership does absolutely true yeah\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for that money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like to over so it was continue investing was partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nWell speaking of labor and Toyota I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves is a great question and something\nThat are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one than sort of very aware of in fact that I taught him was cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if\nYou're going to drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those cars to be used by more people different use cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around or checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to them\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of vehicles are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me then drop it off and then they would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were for fifty years out and autonomy as sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Flagstaff", "day":

and Trump ... saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering\nOr what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the press his job candidate says something and the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable [noise] what\nAbout religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump\nIt's still predominantly Catholic not

crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and or the county

there's not a lot of opportunity beyond maintenance and uh working in warehouses a minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\nMaybe at the margins the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really uh sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump or the Republican Party have come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first eight years\nAgo not the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you know the Republican Party doesn't seem to care\n... ... what about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do

I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were seeing what people are where even seen our impact\nOn this planet and so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about stars right but it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this thin shimmering layer of light that ... is our atmosphere it's this planet that warms us in cools us an envelop says with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nSo it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change [noise] well\nI Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we had these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them at least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIt leaves effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster we really care about each other but that carried only happens\nWhen we're come face to face that\nI can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to the sky something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have [noise] no I actually\nHave a view of earth and I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\n[laughter] and and imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way\nWe were calling the ads that we have that's completely free we're calling it a sky feet at Wright is a sky selfie and that sort of like our connection between the sky you know humanity and the ...\n... ... is a sky selfie and that sort of like our connection between the sky you know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here now dot org and learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions why we have you because you were in space you're the principle of one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years\nSo let's I when I hear your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of of a government is in terms of\nYou know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send\nRight right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet welding counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really change fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form and what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet\nYet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship and the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out as a crew how to live together that means that we do foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happens other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference [noise]\nDirt now are a number or a small number but a number of African American women who've gone into space\nBut you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nSo it it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up in space and it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything\nBecause I would've thought that

over at least ... as we head\nI'm looking out on this day it looks gorgeous can we describe what what is the grass it's over there\nJust got really healthy marsh is throughout the Appalachian Kobe

coming from the Appalachian coal ... percent of it nationwide and and that's changed dramatically over the past couple of years the oysters an indicator species right at the Keystone feces\nIf you have a healthy oyster population that scientists will tell you guess while you're going to find out you've got healthy fishy about healthy crowds you got healthy shrimp and so when you see this\nChallenge without wasters guess what you're going to probably find out you got challenges going on with your other parts of your system\nYou're the river keeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having a healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with this river and really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a kind of place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designations for you\nBut you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river bay mean to them and you will get you will get many stories of why people love this place in our fiercely protective of it\nAnd they include scientists and researchers say\nWe've retreated to the river keepers office of boats have had to be called off the bat whether Dr Felicia Coleman director of Florida state's coasts and Rene love her\nColleague Dr Sondra brook and Roy ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us I start by asking Dr Coleman that question we started with why do we care about this\nI'd say the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all his nutrients is not coming down into\n... said have had tremendous read diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all this nutrients is not coming down into the salad needed water and not coming down anymore such a really important component I think that's overlooked well and talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish growth\nIt's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like always just like the conch which like the saltier water yes\nWhen the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with soldiers that encourages these marine credited such an oyster drills and ...\nAbout these oyster drills that sounds like a horror film duct duct tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like come out\nThey sit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his this scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and tickets for buses in and basically consume the always to from within and there's not a whole lot the always to can do about it it is rather horrific\nYeah check it out on YouTube it's [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I mean some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish\nStart with the day and\nA an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if\nWe're constantly reacting one of the things that happened in the wake of the oil spill was at the fisherman were allowed to go out and harvest all the oysters the fear was that the spill would come in and ... a couple of years later and there was no brood stock left there\nTo re populated I think about the function the set oyster surface is beyond\nThe economics like clean water they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevasse\nAnd the economics they clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster race stores you can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it in a deliberate fashion\nOne of the problems with a day over the last few decades has been\nReaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting coach out there and if that culture is that oil stir shell what they larval oysters settled on\nIt without a plan you might as well be casting it all into the when what\nWould you recommend I mean we haven't even mentioned climate change and the droughts that have been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be\nTheir particular types of research that could be done that could\nRelatively quickly and the next couple of years make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the fisherman really understand what she needed but they want their livelihood restored so there's a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest fix closing the best probably not a terrible idea and I think\nYou
