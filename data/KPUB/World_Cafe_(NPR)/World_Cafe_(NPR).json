think this was at\nThis is an encore edition with our guest Nico case you might know first solo work or as a member of the new pornographers Nichols record hell on is her latest is hunting fascinating gorgeous scary comforting all of that and you could produce did\nWhen she came in during the summer to World Cafe to talk about it Nico and her band performed songs and he couldn't I chatted for a long time like more than an hour and if we could have I Would have sat talk with her all day\nNico told me about the fire that burned her Vermont house to the ground while she was reporting music in

friend's parents' basement and I tried to get a job for a while but since I was under sixteen [noise]\nThat was virtually impossible and I tried to go back to school but I was really hungry all the time and I just wasn't learning and I remember feeling really bad about myself because I'm just like why can't I Do good in that class why can I wake up why can't I\nAnd really I was just really hungry and the kid while it was ugly hungry you mean yes it has very hungry and God you know it it's not\nIt's not cool to try to\nLearn if you're hungry your brain just says no and it's really that simple like you need food\nFor your brain to learn and retain the stuff so and especially if you've maybe not had a lot of some support at home for what school is you might think that you don't have access to learning and the same way that other people do because there's something else about you but really it's just that to like your physical needs aren't taking care of like I'm just thinking with such them with such empathy about what that\nWhat that would be like to be trying to figure out figure out your way\nWell when you don't have anybody to tell you what's happening you just think that you suck and you you think you're stupid and the but then again I I guess I really you know kids also really need they have a real strong impulse to survive and so you you do what you can\nYeah and uh\nYou know just one thing led to another and eventually you know I I kind of moved home for a little bit and there's just too much violence and\nAnd uh I couldn't stay against you or against each other um everyone okay everywhere in every direction [noise] let's see I think that's how most people grow up honestly I don't do you I don't really feel\nI'm a unique in that regard wow\nHonestly I don't do you I don't really feel\nI'm a unique in that regard wow I\nI think that's most people's reality yeah I mean based on the people I Know not everyone grow up that way [noise] I mean I Hope it's way less than I think but yeah\nI'm at so I guess a privilege to think that it's not you know what I mean it is yeah and and a man I Hope I Hope I'm so wrong about it yeah me too me too uh Nico cases my guest here on the world cafe or a new record is called ... and\nUm it sounds like you did a a bit of\nHistorical digging up in the time before making this album about what it is to be a woman and what women's place in history a is can you tell me a little bit about what you were looking for I guess on what you found\n[noise] well I had a lot of\nBad experience with stalkers and a bad experience with the United states government in that regard and bad experience with the law we try to preemptively say things like yeah the country doesn't care about women we treat women terribly and then\nTo go to court and have them treat you really badly and it kind of be in writing\nIs a is a very\nSlapping you awake with the same information you already know and it's ugly it's really ugly and\nThe worst part was watching what it did to the people around me who care about me what did it as they were worried about you and then they watch do you not protected by the ... yeah and and they were destroying themselves trying to protect me\nI just was so angry and so horrible to be around and just hyper vigilant\nThemselves trying to protect me I just was so angry and so horrible to be around and just hyper vigilant\nYou know I'm really lucky that those people still care about me after hanging around with me during that time 'cause you know it's just fight or flight all the time\nI had to answer the question I had to find this focus like okay when in history did we start hating women did we did we demoted than to the role of\nPassenger baby machine slave child property when did we become that\nI read a lot of things and a lot of it made a lot of sense on and it put me on a path and it was a good path but then when I got to a book called the Amazon's by Adrian me or I started feeling\nThis this hopefulness because she is a historian who figure it out with the help of other historians and linguist and archaeologist that Amazon's weren't\nUm mythical like we thought um they were real people who came from several different continents I'm connected to Asia Europe Asia Minor and what that did to me was\nIt validated something I knew in my DNA which is we did not let this happen to us we did not sit there and I'd taken or history for years for example and we had a three inch thick textbook with no women and there were three or five maybe\nAnd I just the whole time you think where are they where are they and the instructors be they men or women in the ... granted this was in the eighties and nineties would say well\nWomen were really allowed to do those things it's like I Know my will\nYou they men or women in the ... granted this was in the eighties and nineties would say well women were really allowed to do those things it's like I Know my will as a quote unquote woman and I know that it's not different from a man I Know that it's not tiny and so\nFiguring out are just having something proven that I always knew\nWas such a major release\nAnd filled me with joy and ice you know I I was so excited to learn about these historians and\nThese archaeologist who were like bringing back women's history from these shallow graves that were just\nHastily dog and thrown some dirt over 'cause you know nobody figured we'd go back and get it but we're going back and getting it\nIt's such an interesting complement to the reckoning that\nIt's hopefully it happening now income in conversations about the way that women are are are treated in the present day in the present world and it's really fascinating to think about just like a about bones [noise]\nUm I like about bones that are sitting there that are telling us these stories about what the untangling that we need to be doing is\nYeah I mean a lot of the skeletons in mass graves of lawyers they just figured that since they were warriors they were all men with DNA testing you know some of them have come up with I think thirty percent of the warriors are women yeah\nAnd in all of those societies that I'm speaking of which are too many to list here but Adrian mayor does an incredible job in her book\nA new cases my guest here on the world cafe or a new record is called ... um does that sort of show up on ... like I'm thinking\nBook a ... is my guest here in the world cafe or a new record is called ... um does that sort of show up on ... like I'm thinking about the warrior cry at that time but that feels like a ... like an army\nOf and the way that you perform it live with two backup singers that you've got with you um today just feels like I can see armies if people women behind you like charging [laughter] don't know is is quite powerful\nYeah and it's not just women and men and women together yeah helping each other out and you know every gender non gender and between like everybody just helping\nEach other out [noise] uh well let's hear you perform Winnie onstage life here at the world cafe [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nUm [noise]\nGetting on [noise]\nThen up and\nThe the the move from\nThere were some real that\nLead to\nThing where they can\nThe go to change their thing and I\nThey build up a\nMountain show when\n... they can\nCan only dream and then a\n\nAnd that's\nThe most\nOf the moral dragon\nDrawing a bass read this poetry and God loves the waiting\nOne thing it's the only\nThing [noise]\nSchooling right there is no real\nGod can really happy to see Neal\nThat's bad luck off ... case she is my guest here in the world cafe that to the studio version recorded a in Sweden another thing happened that I wanted to ask you about at the time that this fire was going on which was that it was being reported I'm In Vermont where you live ... and\nThey were using your name I guess and you found that that they were using your name in reporting on this fire and you've said you've said today is we're sitting here that you do with stalkers in the in the past and had this like we\nI imagine terrifying goes that and now you're overseas and and people are talking about where you live you and you describe that phone call between you and the person that you called at that newspaper I'm my house\nWas still burning at the time I phoned the newspaper and spoke to the news editor and I said listen I'm not asking for you to take the story out just please take me him off\nI have a seriously life threatening situation and I I really need you to take my name off there and he was very condescending and you know move my house burned down and you know and I was like no\nTo to take my name off there and he was very condescending and you know most of my house burned down and you know and I was like no you don't understand this is this is a big deal like I've spent my life savings trying to remedy this um you know my house\nI sold it because I couldn't you know\nPlease just please take my name off and we sold it because you didn't want to have your name yeah I but you still live there but yeah ... well that's how bad it was it was really really bad and\nAnd and uh I I\nWas like yeah I have a daughter you know like come on what what do you\nI can I can hear the gears just I have the tiniest modicum of control over this woman's life and it's just too delicious\nI just can't let it go and I literally on the building right next door to the newspaper which I bought from them we are literal neighbors and I was so angry I started yelling at him and I I think by the end of the phone call I call them several terrible names\nI'm which I'm honest I'm not that sorry about it\nBecause I remember a couple of years before\nThere was a young woman in our town named Melissa Jenkins who was stocked and murdered in front of her child and you know they reported the crap out of that oh my God and they were the the first you know link in the a P chain on that one\n[noise] and\nYou know given the opportunity to actually help out a neighbor avoid that they couldn't be bothered [laughter] I don't know what to say about that other than you know\nHow how do they\nI don't know what to say about that other than you know\nHow how do they\nPut something out there like that after you know getting a lot of traction from the death of a young woman who was beloved in our community who are you people at this point to or we\nYeah like I kind of want Mars to just wipe us out I think the world will be OK without people yeah I don't think that way all the time but\nI've I feel okay for nature knowing that it will be fine without us yeah but it would be a real shame if we took ourselves out of that because we're part of it I'm\nUsing a bit about that on on the last on the record on pitcher honey and I think it's a good time to sort of ... back over the stage at World Cafe near the performance that your quarter to that one but um what I what stands in my mind on that farm and I think your badge is when I'm dark when I'm dark and I'm Down as dark and down as I Am now\nThe only thing that makes me smile is to remember that I loved of the wild is that do have those right yeah and may you ever return to the warmth of your species yeah\nJoined than anything else about that before we get the song or is that just the wish that it is that's yeah that's you\nKnow all the good things about people I that's what I Wish for\nThat they they figure it out\nOK and a man I sound like such a bummer today you don't I don't I'm not a depressed person or sad person it's a bad time right now for sure it's really bad but you know there are\nI don't know that there doesn't seem like there's anything appropriate to say you know at the moment because of what\nI don't know that there doesn't seem like there's anything inappropriate to say you know at the moment because of what's going on in the world around out there and and it's bad yeah like do you feel at least\nHarmful to bring people together when you're performing on stage or when you're singing a song like ... or I'm going together or is\nIt a different thing I Hope that\nSomehow like I I think maybe I exist in kind of a self care room where you know people come and see music when they need\nLike there's a thing human beings can do like a\nA collective consciousness in a room and music is a really great you know tangible example of harmony seen for example human beings can create to human beings can create a third element\nThis the vibration and the feeling of that [noise] it's crazy powerful the band and I work really hard so that we're all in the place to facilitate that feeling of being together ... as a group in kind of a way that people are together when they're falling in love with each other\nIf that makes sense\nYou just done it yeah yeah [noise] um go see some live music people we're gonna we're going to go out on a a live\nPerformance that you did for us um that we were lucky to have you do have a pitch or honey I and I want to thank you and he goes so much for what they do
