percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me in the end\nThis entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand

says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such inexpensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin\nTest [noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive\nTo live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are\nWhich is just inexpensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy tests\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars\nSo I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news

party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted and afterwards he read out part of the constitution to

is a kind of test out of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with\nSophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more ...\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThings [noise]\nSupport for NPR health\nAll of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks

what's important to round the world\nAnd Georgia the most populous state with strict voter ID laws has the most transgender people at risk of this confusion about twenty thousand that's according to report from the Williams Institute at UCLA Jody Herman is one of its authors\nTrans people are in a unique position that there is a whole administrative system governing how trans people are able to get accurate IDs\nEach state handles gender and name changes differently in Georgia a judge has to approve a name change to change the gender marker on your driver's license you needed doctors letter saying you've had gender reassignment surgery\nThe problem is that there are different kinds of transgender surgeries and some trans people don't get any surgery at all Chanel Haley works for Georgia quality which advocates for the L GB teach community she says the Georgia process leads room for objective interpretation by judges and DMV employees\nThat's where the robot will come in mostly and so if you want to get even more people to that that is really more about your passport\nHaley and a coalition of Georgians are lobbying to change the driver services policy [noise]\nTransgender woman\n... is studying to be a social worker in Kennesaw north of Atlanta she and hundreds of others gather for the transgender march in Atlanta Pride earlier this month\nManaged to change her name after finding a judge he knew was trans friendly but not her gender marker since she didn't get the surgery she says that won't stop her from voting and November\nSometimes I can just show someone my ID and had my finger over the gender marker and they don't even look\nI Am very fortunate that some people can't tell that I'm trans\nFinger over the gender marker and they don't even like\nI Am very fortunate that some people can't tell that I'm trans\nSo sometimes I can just resign\nElections officials in Fulton County where Atlanta is safe poll workers aren't supposed to check for gender but every county trains coworkers differently there is a workaround for gender markers getting a passport because the federal government does not require the surgery\nThat's another hurdle though and costs time and money Christian O'Neil is a transgender woman from Atlanta who was also at pride at Georgia judge rejected her name change even though she's been living as a woman for years\nIt's going to be really difficult to to save up any money which sucks because like I Love to have a name that actually matches when I go by and like\nI Love to have a gender like or that matched what I Am\nBecause of that mismatch she sometimes faces skepticism and hostility and she has to show ID\nIt hurts a lot and then you definitely do feel like a like Georgia doesn't really care about about a chance to be cool\nBut despite the difficulty O'Neill still plans to vote in this election for NPR News I'm Emma hurt in Atlanta\nAnd let's look ahead to all things considered later this afternoon

deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they ... for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why both not defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution but\nHe is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need

it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as home Andrea\n... rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that when\nHe wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force than they do they were ready\nPeople hit David are sick of robberies and the sky high moody right yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and

Arizona Public radio can you know you at seven forty five on Monday October twenty ninth I'm Aaron ... things for tuning in now a report from the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change says the planet has already warmed by one degree Celsius\nResearch found it was due to human activity since the industrial revolution and it's on track to get even hotter thousands of experts contributed to the reports which warns the world's carbon emissions need to reach net zero by the you're twenty fifty\nTo avoid catastrophic environmental changes Cain used most assuming he spoke with northern Arizona university scientist Christina ... about the findings\nSo what kind of changes are we seeing from climate change here in Arizona\nA match and if you have any more days in Phoenix for example the temperatures go at that one hundred degrees Fahrenheit and there will be even more when it goes about scientific team so we have this already now sometimes in the summer and it's not pleasant and if we have even more you have\nReally skyrocketing\nIt's already now sometimes in the summer and it's not pleasant and if we have even more you have\nReally skyrocketing air conditioning costs for example\nAnd other aspect is that the water supply and Arizona is going to change drastically and it's going to become very unreliable every place we'll see some form of climate change it will not be the same in every location but there's literally no one who will not be affected by climate change\nSo we're talking about um things that affect our economy um things that affect tourism for example um but also some of these things are potentially life threatening things like heat waves\nYes he drew it can be very life threatening and the problem with that is that you can have your car air condition and you has air conditioned but it will cost you a lot more in the future and not everyone can afford that and I think that's a really important aspect of climate change as well there is this so called climate injustice\nWhich means which people can probably cope with it to some extent better than those that have very little money\nRight yeah the report really emphasized but not everybody's going to feel the effects of climate change equally\nThat is very true and that\nI also think it's important to say that here in Flagstaff we may not be affected so much by sea level rise but there are millions of people worldwide that are affected by sea level rise and they often are\nAmongst the poorest yeah the climate injustice topic is very difficult on there is a moral aspect to it I think\nThis issue has kind of a sense of urgency because of that do you think we can make the changes we need to make by twenty fifty\nYes we we can make the changes\nWe have to make them soon he needed late basically and I think what is important is to you know it's not a geophysical impossibility so we can still do it but\nIt needs a joint effort of governments\nImportant is to you know it's not a geophysical impossibility so we can still do it but it needs a joint effort of governments industry and society and we cannot rely on others to do something we have to do it ourselves\nWhat we're talking about these are really big processes and I think a lot of people when they are here about climate change it feels like it's too big of an issue like there's just nothing they can do how do how do you personally deal with that\nI sometimes feel despair as well and I'm sometimes also overwhelmed by the topic but then I also realize just\nBeing depressed about it it's not going to change anything and there are things that every person can do that if we all do it it actually it really makes a big difference and stuff for example I tried to bike to work and ah I

I had reacted to lip bomb new ...\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test bends or pain\nCall a phony um they tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement is usually found in beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic capsule then they drew a grid on one since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left and then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they test it she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and\nThe bill came I was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't

insurer Anthem Blue cross agreed to a negotiated rate of fourteen thousand dollars the company says it tries to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the math just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patients being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nI Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano oh and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases\nEmbroider pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive through Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief or partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nNot about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position\nHigh prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do well there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive\nAsk what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage

pre existing conditions from member station case you are Alex Smith reports before two thousand fourteen insurance companies could deny coverage to customers who had anything from diabetes to depression\nThe vast majority of voters including most Republicans say they want to protect a preexisting condition coverage that's why in his bid for US Senate Missouri Republican Josh Holly is running ads like this\nEarlier this year we learned our oldest has a rare chronic disease preexisting conditions we know what that's all I can\nAs Missouri's attorney general Holly joined Nineteen or the Republican led states in a lawsuit claims the Affordable CARE Act which made preexisting condition coverage mandatory is unconstitutional\nIncumbent Senator Claire McCaskill who's a Democrat says ... can't say he's for protecting preexisting condition coverage and participate in\nLawsuit if that law students successful it leaves a whole lot of people\nSay he's for protecting preexisting condition coverage and participate in the lawsuit\nIf that lawsuit is successful it leaves a whole lot of people and potentially millions and millions a anticipation that they can no longer access coverage\nHolly has pledged to force insurance to cover a pre existing conditions he recently spoke about his plan in ... county Missouri\nInsurance here in the insurance access guarantee that says that voted for existing conditions can buy insurance plans just like everybody else on the same terms as everybody else\nUnder his plan the federal government would reimburse insurance companies for each person's medical costs that go over ten thousand dollars a year I'll eat doesn't say how this would be paid for that would make the world better than it was\nBefore the CIA but it wouldn't fix many of the other problem with the SEA fixed\nUniversity of Kansas economist David ... says Holly's plant could be a major setback for many in Missouri the federal government subsidizes insurance here for nearly two hundred thousand people those subsidies would disappear if the law went away making insurance unaffordable for many\nInsurance and it's on its own doesn't make you healthy you have to be able to use it has to cover the condition you have and you have to be able to afford the medical bills all the other side of it\nThe healthcare law also requires insurance to pay for things like maternity care drug rehab or check ups\nAnd Indian could allow insurance companies to bring back lifetime limits many uninsured could stop paying after someone's medical costs succeeded said a million dollars despite the health law's benefits skepticism abound in Missouri and that worries supporters\nAt her home in Springfield, Missouri shy in ... round separate three young children for dinner two years ago are now ten year old some land and we've diagnosed with a rare\nPotentially deadly blood disorder well the experience made her a health care advocate her neighbors remains skeptical\nThey don't think it's gone far enough or they think that it has\nSort of well the experience made her a healthcare advocate her neighbors remains skeptical\nThey don't think it's gone far enough or they think that it has these problems that they didn't expect and so they think well anything that anybody's doing has to be better than what we've got now\nMarcy says she's been a mostly independent voter although healthcare his push to toward Democrats she acknowledges there are plenty of problems with the federal health care law but for her part she's baffled by the idea of ditching\nI Would never dreamed that the answer there is taking away some of the most popular things that the Affordable CARE Act did and saying let's start over", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018",

in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports and to our

teachers documentary film production and history at the University of Arizona she joins me on the line hitter Lisa Hi Aaron so we can you give us a feel for what it was like to follow these teachers and and what sir typical day like how hard it do they work\nWell I think one of the biggest misconceptions the teaching profession is that teachers work part time you know they work until three PM they have weekends off they have summers off and\nFrom what I learned following these teachers for over six months is just could not be further from the truth all of the teachers that I followed\nWork well into the evenings there up at the crack of dawn they work on the weekends and then all of them work in the summer um and then on top of that a lot of them have second jobs\nArizona just sounds like such a difficult place to teach as far as the the people you interviewed what is the silver lining what makes them stay on the job\nOf the teacher so I got to film I saw that they were really committed to their students and their school communities and I think that part of the job is really rewarding\nBut the other thing that I saw really strongly was how committed these teachers work education in general so\nIt's not about them you know it's about making the education system better and I think these teachers and a lot of other teachers I'm sure in Arizona are very committed to their\nProfession and I think seeing some change 'em this year I think has been very rewarding\nLet's hear from one of those teachers this is ... sees a husband and father of three\nReally rewarding

the professionalism and and the Kurdish season raises and those are things that come with that is really discouraging\nI don't want to give too much away now but Nathaniel actually contemplates moving to another state for a higher salary how common of thought is that among the teachers you talked to\nSo Nate situation sadly is the norm and not the exception from what I found every teacher has a plan B contemplating either leading the classroom or leading Arizona or just leading that education profession altogether\nThis film will definitely hit home with all of the Arizona teachers out there

Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girls are still on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me\nI'm On the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's set more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its undercut the mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there to continue their relationship with the country and she started up which are the first registered in two thousand it\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow in ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was a man named Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nSix on an evangelical internship and then from there she continued their relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management ditching\nNo and ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start disorganization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls that he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask ... and ...\nPerson for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power according to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with him but she conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nIt was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to ...\nAnd after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually we're going to bring a case they were re tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the city is that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community the sense of ...\nDouble thing that happened in the early points that organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia still a lousy organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the\nBuilding up as an organization like the sea of local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local the local donor community I think I'm a local community had the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has not just a a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThe condition is known as the cutest lasted my light is or a a ... for short it can start with symptoms such as the eye lands and

pointed out that this is not polio\nRight now we know that polio virus is not the cause of these apps and cases CDC is tested every little specimen from math and patients none of this stuff and then

teaching in Arizona follows three educators as they balance their love for the job while living on some of the lowest teachers' salaries in the country at least some ... directed the film and teachers documentary film production and history at the University of Arizona she know joins me on the line who they're Lisa\nHi Aaron\nSo we can you give us a feel for what it was like to follow these teachers and and what is your typical day like how hard it do they work\nWell I think one of the biggest misconceptions the teaching profession is that teachers work part time you know they work until three PM they have weekends off they have summers off and\nFrom what I learned following these teachers for over six months is just could not be further from the truth is all the teachers that I followed\nWork well into the evenings there up at the crack of dawn they work on the weekends and then all of them work in the summer um and then on top of that a lot of them have second jobs\nJust sounds like such a difficult place to teach as far as the the people you interviewed\nYou know they work until three PM they have weekends off they have summers off and\nFrom what I learned following these teachers for over six months is just could not be further from the truth all of the teachers that I followed\nWork well into the evenings there up at the crack of dawn they work on the weekends and then all of them work in the summer um and then on top of that a lot of them have second jobs\nArizona just sounds like such a difficult place to teach as far as the the people you interviewed what is the silver lining what makes them stay on the job\nOf the teachers but I got to film I saw that they were really committed to their students and their school communities and I think that part of the job is really rewarding\nBut the other thing that I saw really strongly was how committed these teachers were to education in general so it's not about them you know it's about making the education system better and I think\nThese teachers and a lot of other teachers I'm sure in Arizona are very committed to their profession and I think\nSeeing some change 'em this year I think has been very rewarding\nWell let's hear from one of those teachers this is ... sees a husband and father of three he's been teaching history and government for eleven years at a Tucson high school says he takes homeless than one thousand dollars every two weeks\nI don't get paid enough for the work that I Do [noise] and that's not a belt me being greedy about mean not really respected\nI feel like I'm good at my job and to not feel like I'm given the professionalism and and the Kurdish season raises and those are things that come with that is really discouraging\nI don't want to give too much away now but in this and you'll actually contemplates moving to another state\nTeaching history and government for eleven years at a Tucson high school says he takes homeless than one thousand dollars every two weeks\nI don't get paid enough for the work that I Do [noise] and that's not a about me being greedy about mean not feeling respected I feel like I'm good at my job and to not feel like\nI'm given the professionalism and and the Kurdish season raises and all the things that come with that is really discouraging\nI don't want to give too much away now but ... actually contemplates moving to another state for a higher salary how common of a thought is that among the teachers you talk to\nSo Nate situations sadly is the norm and not the exception from\nWhat I found every teacher has a plan B contemplating either leading the classroom or leading Arizona or just leading that education profession altogether\nThis film will definitely hit home with all of the Arizona teachers out there who else will benefit from watching the documentary", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day": "17", "locations": [["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098],

course especially after you know last year is very dry dry winter or can you just talk about this crazy aren't over whether I Know we've seen I mean at least in insurance Flagstaff I saw on it was it was Wednesday snowfall I Believe force lakes recorded six inches\nSo that was a nice little storm there and it has been a wet and cool October for sure it all got started right there at the beginning of the month we had the remnant moisture from it was\nHurricane Rosa came through and then from then on that was on October ... we've had quite a bit of moisture and even a little bit of snow snow's not completely unusual in October and Flagstaff we do average three inches of\nYou're and even a little bit of snow snow's not completely unusual in October and Flagstaff we do average three inches of snow fall and I think uh\nWe've had two measurable snows flags afterwards when earlier in the mind\nWhich all is amounted to an inch and a half at ... am airport but other portions of town you mentioned for another portion of the northern Arizona have seen some pretty significant snowfall including the San Francisco piece which just looked beautiful uh and they are at six plus inches of snow up there or even\nApproaching a foot of snow at some of the higher elevations so it has been a a a lovely start here till October but um\nYou know I think it was getting it was like we're quite ready for it right into winter here that gets them October weather so right\nUm I Want to get through the weekend a forecast year in just a moment but first of all of this what October whether do we think there's any\nCorrelation here with a with what's going to happen in winter well I think it's definitely\nA good sign that the storm track is active and uh\nDon't know how correlated they actually are you know I mean\nI'm it would be interesting to look at a hundred years I'm does a wet fall lead into a wet winter um but I don't have that data set my feeling is that they probably are correlated somewhat but it does not for sure I mean we're going into a wet winter in fact you know this\nFirst very active half of the month with storms is are gonna fade away we have one more little store system this weekend with uh some showers and thunderstorms it's a mild storm not going to bring any snow fall the region or anything and temperatures are actually going to be warmer than where they are or the next couple of days under sunshine\nBut we will see some showers and thunderstorms but then going into the second half of October things really quiet down for us here so ah which it does\nNext couple of days under sunshine but we will see some showers and thunderstorms but then going into the second half of October things really quiet down for us here so uh which doesn't mean anything about winter either and you know we are going into a week El Nino\nType a pattern here going in a winner which would kilter odds a little bit towards I a wetter than average winter and so we'll hope for that but it's hard to predict that stuff because I mean we've had an El Nino is just in in in recent memory where\nIt's been dry during an El Nino oh you're so right I mean we had the Godzilla El Nino right into anything that we had let me know what you're supposed to be dry and it was wetter than the Godzilla El Nino\nAnd so you know it just killed the odds but nothing's guaranteed it's tough to be weatherman is what you're saying\nYeah you know the long term forecasting I Try to stay out of that you know I'm just I'm just forecasting for the next couple of days

there something more to it\nWas not oil for arms is oil and arms\nOf recent years the United states has become much more self sufficient in terms of energy but Saudi Arabia remains a huge producer of oil and more important incredibly influential in the international setting of oil prices\nBut it's also a purchaser as President Trump has repeatedly said\nOf arms made by U.S companies but there's

David Greene and I'm Noel King good morning the u._s. stock market looks ready to recover some of yesterday's dramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei that hangs saying but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because\nChina stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob you more into our with thirty percent drop for China's stock markets\nNearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob good morning Noel I spent thirty percent drop for tainted stock market sounds pretty darn bad what's going on\n[noise] well China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans\nAre invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edited weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well what's interesting here is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing [noise]\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try

atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNot a company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because a researcher at UC Santa Barbara\nYou said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution the things that the climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nThe call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and started talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause as watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock and a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe

Studio now highly hey good morning to you\nSo I Want to get to the weekend in just a moment but first let's recap what's been a a wet and kind of a wild start to fall this\nFar it certainly has really you know this October has been one for the record books across much of Arizona will just start with Phoenix because it's there are the most impressive that out of October it five\nPoint three five inches in Phoenix that's nearly their yearly precipitation total but it is the third\nWettest month ever recorded not only October third met wettest month of all time ever recorded in Phoenix it over a hundred years and here in Flagstaff where just over four inches which I Believe puts us that uh the seventh or six the wettest\nOctober of all time\nJust over four inches which I Believe puts us at uh the seventh or six the wettest\nOctober of all time so it has been a cool and wet month for sure it seems like we went right for monsoon into the beginning of this month when we had some hurricane moisture all through that we had a fall storm and even some mountains snow across the region it's been a mixed bag\nAround here this October but that things are changing here going into\nThe final days of the month not to mention we had a tornado as well touchdown so much doubt outside of winds low last week and just over a rural area very a week kind of wrote tornado but you know not totally unusual October's the month that we usually see tornadoes\nPeople maybe recall I think it was back in two thousand twelve the big tornado outbreak out towards ... might have been two thousand nine\nIt's escaping me right now but there was like eight confirmed touchdowns\nSo now we shift into more fall like whether this weekend final you know it took us like you know for weeks to food for it to feel like ...\nOr mild fall whether we should say I mean it was some wet fall weather and a little on the cool side and we'd have certainly been accustomed\nTo some mild October's around here in recent years this October was a special kind of treat but ah we're moving into some very mild weather here as something we haven't talked about recently high pressure\nActually building into the region and an extended period here of some actually above normal temperatures and ah all sunshine OK\nNow let's move ahead a little bit here because we just got the confirmation from climatologist that uh El Nino appears to be forming in the Pacific\nOr no it just released an El Nino watch warmer than average editorial Pacific waters are forming and there was a Seventy seven\nRight ah no it just released an El Nino watch warmer than average editorial Pacific waters are forming and there was a Seventy Seventy five percent chance we move into an El Nino winter here it is forecast to be a week\nEl Nino which is typically not a huge deal across the southwest but it's still tilts our odds\nTowards a a wetter than average winter just slightly tilted\nTowards a a wet winter versus you know when no what comes out the climate Prediction Center comes out with our ah winter outlooks and they just did for the three month outlook period\nOf November December and January and they have Arizona in a thirty three to forty percent chance\nOf wetter than average it doesn't mean it's gonna be super what that means we're slightly tilted towards wetter than average let's say we were a forty
