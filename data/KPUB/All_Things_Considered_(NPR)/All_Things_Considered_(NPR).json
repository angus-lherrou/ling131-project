in yesterday's attack and during the service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor wrestle ... said he that he held a special surface to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed ah to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my sermons also find our voice you know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts\nAnd that is fine but we must do more we must put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not the new American way cannot be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today I guess there\nBecause we are an open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back and\nI open and affirming you mean every once in a while because everyone is welcome to sexual right everyone is welcome and and knowing welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple of\nAh folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer the words of Thanksgiving they did not state to worship but they did come and to say thank you for doing this you know it makes a difference

a tax on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony was beef was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell this church has recently in kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of the situation like that of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind to start here because I'm responsible for eight or nine children at a time\nAnd how I Would evacuating and then from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I just running through my head kind of plans that I've come up for years\nReally and is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened were you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nI grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook

school or things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad\nYou know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking about\nWe also met a father and son oldest and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today an owner said his own life experiences allow him to feel

E. essay in Pittsburgh and not far from here thousands are gathering to remember the eleven people who were shot to death at a local synagogue the Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall in Oakland, Pennsylvania\nThe eleven people who were shot to death and a local synagogue\nThe Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania faith leaders and politicians from ... from throughout Pennsylvania and beyond have gathered in a packed auditorium\nNPR's Quil Lawrence has outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh community ... welcome thank you so much for talking to us\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nThere was a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is a big ... Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\n... some lovely now um you also spent some time in squirrel hill the neighborhood where this attack occurred what was the mood there\n[noise] yeah I mean people were out and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going to Sunday services and you can see the diversity of the community it's notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the six president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what she said\nI have to wait and patients and now says hey I think I'm going\nAnd I came today that\nWeight and patients and now that they I think I'm going to let them read the articles and these articles that I Want to sit and talk of the class and just giving them a space I have\nProcess a half and what they thought they were really moved by family the Holocaust or weak\nAnd people were saying that you know in the little town like this you never think can happen but in today's America they realize it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I ran into dance Franco he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal he's what he said\nAnd they were really specials we learn\nA unknown so for many years and whenever I go to a tree of life for a bar mitzvah or a wedding or some kind of case and two of them are always see in the in the sanctuary\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying is next\nI felt like people were in the sorrow this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solidarity that community showing and then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents but the community is trying to take action they say they want to do something\nEleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents the community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said he talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence cool thank you\nThank you\nAnd as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this\nThat are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children and how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in the studio Sarah thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand that you actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's\nMinds and fortunately I've covered several of these now in my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible though for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified that\nSo you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue he also went to other places tell us about that\nActually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great one actually and\nUh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want a place for families to to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and and uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today just that you hear it happening everywhere\nJesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nJust that you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening here\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages four and six we're from Canada so\nSo it was very new to us living here for the last year to start seeing more prominently [noise]\nAcross the room Alisa Hoffman was also ensure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nPut it into a contract where they understand um [noise]\nYou know so we haven't really talked about it yeah I have\nWe will Hoffman grew up in the Pittsburgh area and was back here to visit family and like so many here she has ties to\nSend a lot of my\nFriends had by a bar mitzvah that tree of life I\nAttendant Sunday school because my best friend growing up was Jewish and that's where she went so it was just really [noise]\nPricing upsetting you know disappointing that that\nPeople get these thoughts and their head and and do it [noise]\nYou know and I think that they [noise]\nDevon bill runs the make shop a plate and crafts area for the kids she says the museum staff has been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time [noise]\nSo today it's hard to be at work\nHard to um know that we are the helpers here and we are the ones offering support for those families and children while we are also struggling with our own feelings\nBut the way that I'm looking at it is\nYou know we are part of a community together as a pool and that\nBut the way that I'm looking at it is\nYou know we are part of a community together at all and that I'm being\nWith the community right now feels are important and powerful for me to\nDid the current sort of political anger and conflict playing uh so I Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer finals are going to be going through his home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends\nI kind of thing but Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bowers the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd pure as usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and she's really going\nAnd you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent that's just who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the ... solar in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any of this was all she does and I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with the with\nTwitter he's once again denouncing the price as the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're battling taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric mc\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House thanks Asia thank you\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nYou're listening to all things

your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name\nUm [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIt's for forty four with and I'm secular with Arizona Public radio news from Flagstaff\nA report from the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change says the planet has already warmed by one degree Celsius due to human activity since the industrial revolution\nAnd it's on track to get hotter thousands of experts contributed to the report which warns the world's carbon emissions need to reach net zero by the year twenty fifty to avoid catastrophic environmental changes\nK. and they use Melissa ... spoke with northern Arizona university scientists Christina she do about the findings\nWhat kind of changes are we seeing from climate change here in Arizona you match and if you have any more days in Phoenix for example the temperatures go adopt one hundred degree Fahrenheit\nAre we seeing from climate change here in Arizona\nYou imagine if we have many more days in Phoenix for example where temperatures go above one hundred degrees Fahrenheit and there will be even more when it goes up off one hundred Fifteen so we have this already now sometimes in the summer and it's not pleasant and if we have even more you have\nReally skyrocketing air conditioning costs for example\nAnd other aspect is that the water supply and Arizona is going to change drastically and it's going to become very unreliable every place we'll see some form of climate change it will not be the same in every location but there's literally no one who will not be affected by climate change\nSo we're talking about um things that affect our economy um things that affect tourism for example um but also some of these things are potentially life threatening things like heat waves\nYes he drew it can be very life threatening and the problem with that is that you can have your car air condition and you has air conditioned but it will cost you a lot more in the future and not everyone can afford that and I think that's a really important aspect of climate change as well there is this so called climate injustice\nWhich means which people can probably cope with it to some extent better than those that have their little money\nRight yeah the report really emphasize that not everybody is going to feel the effects of climate change equally\nThat is very true and say\nI also think it's important to say that here in Flagstaff we may not be affected so much by sea level rise but there are millions of people worldwide that are affected by sea level rise and they often are\nAmongst the poorest yeah the climate injustice topic is very difficult on there is a moral aspect to it I think\nThis issue has kind of a sense of urgency because of that do you think we can make the changes we need to make by twenty fifty\nYes we we can make the change\nAnd see because of that do you think we can make the changes we need to make by twenty fifty\nYes we we can make the changes\nWe have to make them soon\nHe needed late basically and I think what is important is to you know it's not a geophysical impossibility so we can still do it but it needs a joint effort of governments industry in society and we cannot rely on others to do something we have to do it ourselves\nWhat we're talking about these are really big processes and I think a lot of people when they are here about climate change it feels like it's too big of an issue like there's just nothing that can do how do how do you personally deal with that\nI sometimes feel despair as well and I'm sometimes also overwhelmed by the topic but then I also realize just\nBeing depressed about it is not going to change anything and there are things that every person can do that if we all do it it actually it really makes a big difference and so for example I tried to bike to work and ah I reduce my electricity consumption at home I eat less meat and things like this\nBut one thing that everyone can do is is a vote for someone who has an agenda that includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions and things like this so I think that that's actually a really important aspect that you can do\nBecause it just riding your bike to work is probably not enough Christina shadow like you so much for talking with me today You're welcome it was a

Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turn around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down and two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nSee emotional yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what does the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a\nDark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nThe time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect the larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don skits\nSkidmore lived with his wife and step son the has the each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here yeah very elevated he writes a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry in the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people you know is great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace policies that eighty see you again today Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nAre a little bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the healthcare field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nVery much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me I Know you were married to\nThis is how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed ... did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\n[noise] yeah I Would say because um I at that point\nWas used to being independent used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about your work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet [noise]\nI'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that but I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and\nStuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do it\nKind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all that you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but\nThat was not the case\nAnd just say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nConcert was already running [laughter]\nThose are fireworks going off overhead Wired's nights hair haunted thrill heart\nPeyton runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did at willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself has seems like a fantasy world or something or you know the current owners invited us to take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gate since that\nDay draws a him six hurting\nOur tour guide is Jeff ... he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility\nThe site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don Skidmore seems shaken revisiting has passed I don't know if you remember this this little\nCircle Dr ... office buildings right there so we\nWe left it\nThe trees like the leaves on the street\nMm yeah office buildings right there yeah so we\nWe left it\nLike the trees like the leaves on the street it's kinda cool kind of eerie [laughter]\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant it's now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing traffic jams fog in our in\nOur melts cars are driving by themselves and freezing rural\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone but on the cross bar underneath and faded black paint you can barely make out the ghost\nOf another logo United Auto workers and the name of the union chapter that Skidmore represented local

auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd\nStanding here it's emotional yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what does the phrase willow run mean to you at this point when you hear it today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and yeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and you know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect the larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don

the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job represent the people you know is great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace\nPolicies that eighty so you're good\nToday Don green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nLittle bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nThey after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflect the bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed ...\nDid the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the people that was going on in your professional life\nI Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent used to being able to ...\n[noise] yeah I Would\nSay because um I at that point was used to being independent used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independents again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Peyton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot\nPeyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but\nThat was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he

Michelle Martin we're going to return to a difficult and for some people and traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd dump ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr primary thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christie bossy four testified about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that is what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus uh the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's going to be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to you than you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nLet me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties never\nWe're at a party right yeah let me start by saying this was an unusual\nEvent for me because I never went to parties never and so I I don't even know why I went\nI didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kids came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window to about ten of us one out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching\nAnd as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out\nAnd so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off and then he he he took her panties off\nAnd then he he pulled on his pants\nAnd he went on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumps up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other parts of the party started touching another young woman who was also passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes later\nA she was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was\nWhen the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nKnow you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would've been told the chips fall [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is a you know\nAnd shame they would have been told that your fault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nAh [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilt you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us was that you said I wanted to tell this story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard\nPeople say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't answer that I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent\nOn this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done\nI think that should be part of it [noise]\nHow did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] well [laughter] let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that to this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now\nEmail ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to take let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good and how did\nYou explain that to your boys well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh\nThey were very receptive\nOn their dad you know dad's can you know we we kinda can't do too much from in the in the eyes of our kids\nAre they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now and he said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it\nThat's what they told but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they yeah I mean but in that sense that kid wouldn't have done it because you wouldn't have wanted to be on film you say well we film everything you know what they were kinda alluding to\nWell how do you feel now that you got it off your chest\nYou know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings I'll be honest there there are days when I regret it and then there are days that\nI'm Glad I did you know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time someone it it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit this a lot of women ah said ah\nThey were glad I did it and they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a assaulted\nWho wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I

reminiscent of a Rembrandt but it's actually the work of artificial intelligence\nIs called a portrait of Edmund Bellamy the word was created using an algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars computer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house now that is new\nArt appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this in welcome thank you a pleasure to be here Elsa how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art well I think every\nCouple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art\nYou can go back to the early ... century and you can look at the euro and oh by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's urine and hang it on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it's\nAgain we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it the hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process to roll out\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the ... the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garner the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and\nPrice no I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of are the things that matter than most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated artwork hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened\nBecause this is a canvas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited and numbered edition after the sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the CEO of rare era appraisals just outside of Washington DC thank you

well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae BP to people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that is we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you\nThink yeah this is Gina I think are finally I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not

table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy ... woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nMontanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated where trans individual could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou know the three of you not only represent different parties in different parts of the United states you also

that in\nTrans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYet the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellows in and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell us so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to uh [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nThis is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then and\nFull but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nThe Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do you think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nTime I mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties\nThere are certainly in both parties folks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again we're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae beauty acute candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we use of all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well do you know\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington and Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what Amelia discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just\nUm you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity

stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well to those young people that are falling behind us [noise] I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us today Dan in is is running for

gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy ... woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry I water for us and we have to step

the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party

Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae B.

Q. candidates as well do you know\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what

bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity

stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing

and that's the warden showed dom showing us around and do what we do that and the community of right now are for outside and our yard with ... and I guess it's still a prison\nThe Warren is the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are especially harsh because across the country women get disciplined at higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules\nThey're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences women get time at it to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison

very ... NPR's Jackie Northam\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner President Trump's close advisor and son in law during ... time at the White House that relationship now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance\nNPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe is here to tell us more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with Mohammed bin Salman\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump\nTo go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to ah Canada or Mexico first\nA cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really ...\nMany leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to be the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on ... uh and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of prisoners portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... rolling working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared of August there is such a\nGenius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump\nOr but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state of flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the crowd press\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House officials who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a after could show gee went missing Mitt went missing the White House said he and other officials\nOut to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... showed gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house\nAnd he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel ah to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security chain\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear at some of these dealings are are not transparent up\nBut we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports uh that cushion or a cushion or a backed are associated of firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot\nThank you [laughter] you're listening to

the house but when you've got a real different set of circumstances than doesn't seem so\nSo strange to do and it kills people from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen Seventy one people died from carbon monoxide poisoning after a hurricane or tropical storm the most common reason for these kinds of debts is that people put the generator in their homework garage so ... says don't do that\nMake sure it's at least twenty feet away from your home so that any carbon monoxide will not enter your home and will not cause any illnesses or death\nI mean is there a risk of electrocution

about this political editor\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for British and European economies\nGeorge Parker has written about this piece of political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following the negotiations welcome back to the program hello if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty ninth when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal where\nEverybody ended up throwing plates and each other in person left to you in very bad Dutch and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have\nA immediate you'd have to check some old goods coming in and out to the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment that will quickly to huge queues the ports coming into person and very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very chaotic and damaging ... for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nThere's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you introduce border checks the place where there are ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant from the poor so\nPretty serious sets us in our ears are being considered by ministers when you look at the longer term you can\nThey will be shortages set in the in more distant parts from the port so pretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what was happening in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red tape at the borders and that without to business costs\nYou will make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential fatalities as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHits it's bit akin to sort of an aircraft gradually losing hide she wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European expos so they were the ... effect on all manner of European produces whether it's a new one produces in France cop she says in Germany\nOr you name it they ... they will be effective because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing\nLate rides there's about five percent chance that you never come back to where again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increased revenues by one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue that went to two percent which we tested apologies and involved sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we'd shock these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to the future and then the ... and do better because then maybe maybe for some of them had another bad experience and that as a result the those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever had a good effect I'm\nNot in our data um [noise] so [laughter]\nI think they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect ... or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet it seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer sticks and so you know when we enter in a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering our brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from my company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nWe tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWe tested apologies with or without a coupon and which we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was a just a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different languages is money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may ... ... it wasn't a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten years ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your editors and flowers oh eight\nFlowers and candy things always take on a whole new significance um did it has it changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nWhen people don't always wanted to ask you this question of course they do I'm curious\nI think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always be skeptical whenever I Apologize so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest insincere morsel because people are

Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today to be crystal clear\nThe United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse this out there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister true though he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the CBP is ...\nUndesirable you know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the

be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a

are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out

former head of FEMA and a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach in other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nAnd this is a part of Florida that's what I called the ... floor on a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction\nThis is all generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John history no structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a goes down as you go further north and Florida\nThere have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal

a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter David provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's

the school discriminates against Asian American applicants\nHarvard is defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered great thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have racing it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what ... missions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents filtered missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well\nAnd sort of use the personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although there is going higher and everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case have alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups and that at the end of the day this loss\nUsing Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups and that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that's true at all clearly affirmative action has failed and at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial he was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\n[noise] so I think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at met in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus\nThings includes race or not yeah I Would agree with that I Would say that\nAll of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty\nBecause when we focus on something like race I think it creates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking

Arizona teachers are the focus of a new documentary screening tonight in Flagstaff\nThe film teaching in Arizona follows three educators as they balance their love for the job while living on some of the lowest teacher salaries and the country\nWe ... directed the film and teaches documentary production at the University of Arizona she spoke with Kenny used married granola so we can you give us a feel for what it was like to follow these teachers and and what is their typical day like how hard it do they work\nWell I think one of the biggest misconceptions the teaching profession is that teachers work part time you know they work until three PM they have weekends off they have farmers off and\nFrom what I learned following these teachers for over six months as this could not be further from the truth all the teachers that I followed work well into the evenings there up at the crack of dawn they work on the weekends and\nThen all of them work in the summer um and then on top of that a lot of them have second job\nAnd then all of them work in the summer um and then on top of that a lot of them have a second job\nArizona just sounds like such a difficult place to teach as far as the the people you interviewed what is the silver lining what makes them stay on the job\nOf the teachers but I got to a film I saw that they were really committed to their students and their school community is and I think that part of the job is really rewarding\nBut the other thing that I saw really strongly was how committed these teachers were to education in general so it's not about them you know it's about making the education system better and I think he is\nTeachers and a lot of other teachers I'm sure in Arizona are very committed to their\nProfession and I think seeing some change 'em this year I think has been very rewarding\nWell let's hear from one of those teachers ... sees a husband and father of three he's been teaching history and government for eleven years at a Tucson high school says he takes homeless than one thousand dollars every two weeks\nI don't get paid enough for the work that I Do [noise] and that's not about me being greedy about mean not feeling respected\nI feel like I'm good at my job and to not feel like I'm given the professionalism and and the Kurdish season raises and those things that come with that is really discouraging\nI don't want to give too much away now but Nathaniel actually contemplates moving to another state for a higher salary how common of a thought is that among the teachers you talk to\nNate situations sadly is the norm and not the exception from what I found every teacher has a plan B contemplating either leading a classroom or leading\nFrom what I found every teacher has a plan B contemplating either leading the classroom or leading Arizona or just leading that education profession altogether\nThis film will definitely hit home with all of the Arizona teachers out there but who else will benefit from watching the documentary\nThis is a really great question because and making this film our goal was to have\nEveryone see the realities of being a teacher in Arizona so you know obviously parents have to have a good understanding of what their child teacher does certainly we love for politicians to see this film I'm with a\nBusiness leaders to see this film I mean you know in order to get\nBusinesses to come to Arizona\nWe have to have good schools here to attract families so I feel like there's so much to learn by just watching the film and coming out and seeing it\nLisa I really appreciate the time and thanks for speaking with us about the film appreciate it thank you for having me\nThat was going to use ... speaking with Lisa ... director of the film teaching in Arizona and screams tonight at five o'clock at Flagstaff is less of medical centers muggy auditorium a panel discussion will follow with Lisa and local educators [noise]\nTomorrow during MORNING EDITION K. and meteorologist Lee born provides the weekend whether outlook sponsored by the pizza patio in downtown Flagstaff\nRains shine fleet or snow before making weekend plans learn what to expect from Mother Nature over the next four days [noise]\nThe top of the hour on all things considered NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with Lydia dented investigator with the project on government oversight about how ...\nTo the top of the hour on all things considered NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with Lydia dented investigator with the project on government oversight about how much Saudi Arabia has spent in the U.S on lobbying and let the money has bought them later\nUs funded school in a rocket the former ISIS capital is helping children cope with invisible scars of war but funding it\nFunding for it will come to an end in December because of aid cuts ordered by President Trump post race and a lot more after the ... the our\nFunding for K.

that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they'd been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word they kind of look like ...\nAren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our swat them a better word that kind of

propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA\nIs planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt to the point and it's all good pointing from the perspective of\nWhat it means a lot on non\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks\nThat means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News partial sure are still so Sean hundreds of thousands of veterans who've received less than

negotiations will come back to the program polar if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty ninth when the u._k. leaves the\nWell that could be quite severe ... kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal with\nEverybody ended up throwing place with each other in person left to you in very bad dosage and indeed than you could see some very serious impacts to the border so you would have\nA and B you'd have to check some old goods coming in and also the u._k. which doesn't help of the moment that we could do to huge queues of the pools coming into person I'm very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out of ... trees were closed\nVery quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very detailed chicken damaging EPA say for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency plan and getting on the u._k. in case this happens talk of stockpiling of medicines there's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly\nThere are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit calling me will take a very big ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines once you ... a place where there are ... for the moment you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so\nSo there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the pool so\nPretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate says what would happen in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock could cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red tape out the borders and that without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well so the u._k. treasuries estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHit ... sort of an aircraft\nCrunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person will be a poor taste\nWould it be in the case which is a pretty big hit and spit out into sort of an aircraft crunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European ... so they would be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's um and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nAnd you name it they ... they will be effective because UK off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for all the all the European Union countries but the point is is a symmetric shock waltz it's true that some other European countries with suffering as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more the lesson to be honest I I mean we all quiet at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere's another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does a deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my base assumption still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nParker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks

the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou know just like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its broader we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue so I went to two percent which we tested apologies in of all sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw is that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do but in the future and then the ... he didn't do better because then maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and that as a result the those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nIn our data I'm so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily\nThan the control group that got no apology at all did they ever have a good effect I'm\nNot in our data so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on scripts interest X and so you know entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that you might may not find a bit was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or here's your letters and flowers flowers and candy and so it takes\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize\n[laughter] people thought always wanted to ask you this question how they do I was curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies\nPeople thought always wanted to ask you this question how do I was curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my

[noise]\nA couple of years ago scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell green\nA separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should fall ... [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our lack of a better word that kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland\nShe says they used a proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt pointing at at that point from the perspective of what it means a lot on non\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word\nNell Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News\nPartial Sean I still

Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following the negotiations welcome back to the program ... if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty nine when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal where\nEverybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very but\nDon't you and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have\nA immediately you'd have to check some old goods coming in and out of the u._k. which doesn't have the moment that will quickly to huge queues to the pool it's coming into person and very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out of ... trees were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very detailed chicken

food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal\nFresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big has\nSaid you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some talk of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you ... the place where there are ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant parts from the port so pretty serious sets us in our ears are being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what was happening in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red tape on the board is not without to business costs\nYou will make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential for terrorists as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHits and spit out into sort of an aircraft\nCrunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe is the u._k. leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European ... so they would the U.S an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's ...\nIt's a major destination for European exposed so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether some and they won produces in France cop produces in Germany\nUm you name it they ... they will be effective because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for all the all the European Union countries but the point is is a symmetric shock waltz it's true that some other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all ... at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides are not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political

it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou did this like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to where again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decrease the revenues that went to two percent which we tested apologies and involves sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the ... and do better cars than maybe it's maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished you but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nNot in our data um [noise] so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nRemorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer is six and so you know enter in a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may not find a bit was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into

flowers and candy and so it takes\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nWhen people thought always wanted to ask you this question how they do I was curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always it's awfully skeptical whenever I apologized so I have to

Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all empty the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same that border agents have wide discretion and decisions\nPorter's posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to Lynn Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use ... welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that\nWhole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to\nBecause right now he has a diplomatic passport and be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S

defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race Kelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nKate thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see and missions policies change not to have race it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering one at assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to that racist sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on I think Harvard as saying that they do that but let's see ... has been showing it\nNearly factor but often times the factory that a decision is based on I think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what's in for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents are missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal ratings artificially keep their numbers lower although there is going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of allege that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something the Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to

think\nThat a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize\nSo I think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at married in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of a sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits of it are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to racial ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the

are emptying out others are bustling according to the international council of shopping centers over the last five years more malls have opened and closed\n... Cohen is a former CEO of serious candidate he now teaches at Columbia Business school he\nTold me some malls will actually benefit from all the Sears stores shutting down\nThere are triple lays or super regionals as they refer to\nWho are booming who are\nReceiving the news of Sears demise or near demise with glee\nBecause if Sears is still doing business in in their facility they're happy to take the space back these are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully tentative and there were only a limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor store but they've got others American what would they do with the sheer space\nThey're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential opportunity in the form of added food offerings things of that sort okay and then there are B and C moles and these are smaller\nThese tend to be older in many cases they've already lost the Sears and the prognosis\nThe malls and these are smaller these tend to be older in many cases they've already lost his ears and the prognosis for these bees and sees is grim\nWhy can't they do the same thing as the ... why can't they re imagine the space and out of food court or something\nThey can do it on paper but they can't manage it financially because the malls volume has declined to the extent that there is no financial viability left\nWhen you talk about the triple a malls that are thriving or those congregated in a certain part of the country is there a certain type store type layout that is working for them to pay me a little bit more of a picture of what does look like\nThey're dispersed throughout the United states and they straddle urban population center and heavily populated affluent suburban community\nSo they're typically the biggest shiny is penny in the marketplace in virtually every major population centers throughout the United states there is one and in some cases two of these AAA centers that are doing fine they're fully tended to they've got lots of footsteps\nThey're still sought out as destinations by customers\nIt sounds as though you're describing a landscape in which some malls are disappearing some malls are thriving but all of them are being re imagined as in what ways where I've been willing anchor store be as important as it was a generation ago people rethinking outdoor versus indoor spaces what trends are you seeing\nAll the eggers store was typically a department store in the department stores genre is for the most part on its way out but now several things have happened first of all the apparel an accessory trends have declined uh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on tech\nAnd uh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on tech\nAnd on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of a close\nAnd the whole idea that an over large box will act as the draw for a mall is probably outmoded as well and many of the triple a malls or so to speak the anchor tenant as someone like the apple store my\nWhich doesn't occupy a traditional acres space but draws an enormous amount of traffic into the center\n[noise] do you go shopping malls regularly no fly\nWhen I was a gainfully employed in the business I did that two and three times a week everywhere in the United states and Canada but frankly um they're they're less and less attractive the offer less and less appeal and I've gravitated like millions and millions of other folks\nTo the Internet which is a much more convenient obviously a much more likely to be successful\nAt ... at Columbia Business school he was former C.

the aging headquarters of the FBI which happens to sit across the street from President Trump's Washington hotel a newly released batch of emails indicates the president influenced a federal decision to keep the FBI on the same site\nTrump's involvement in the fate of the property is being investigated by Democrats on the house oversight committee who are concerned about possible presidential conflicts of interest NPR's Peter Overby reports\nThis all has to do with the FBI and it's old dilapidated headquarters in D.C the building sits across Pennsylvania Avenue from President Trump's hotel\nThe general services administration the federal government real estate manager plan to move the FBI to bigger facilities in Washington suburbs Dorothy row buying uh GST official explained the financial angle to a house hearing in twenty Thirteen\nWe believe the Pennsylvania avenues site has considered her potential for higher and better use than as a headquarters of a federal agency we hope to unlock that hidden value and apply it to the creation of a new facility in fact Donald Trump\nUnlock that hidden value and apply it to the creation of a new facility\nIn fact Donald Trump before he was president showed an interest in developing the old FBI side but by twenty sixteen he was about to cut the ribbon at the current hotel he bragged about it on the campaign trail theories in Fairfield, Connecticut\nWere very very complex for luxury hotels good old boy a lot of people it's almost finish it more\nAnd last winter Trump stopped the FBI is move it happened in the White House meeting with officials from the FBI and gee I say the new plan is to rebuild the old headquarters although it means moving thousands of workers elsewhere this spring TSA administrator Emily Murphy told a house committee Trump had nothing to do with the decision to rebuild\nThe the destruction that we got came from the FBI and with the FBI that direct and she has to watch requirements

the government money and also the FBI leadership did not want to move its headquarters Kathleen Clark is a law professor at Washington University in St Louis her specialty is governmental ethics\nThis is a problem because Trump's intervention may well have been motivated by his personal financial concerns with his own hotel\nBut she points out the president is exempt from federal ethics laws

considered from NPR News\nHistorically white Americans have distanced themselves from many non white ancestry they might have\nNow many are claiming some because they're proud on some because they're trying to tap into benefits designed for minorities so what exactly make someone a minority as Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch team tells us it's complicated\nPresident Trump has been mocking Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's assertion that she has Native American ancestry since twenty sixteen oh God\nThat's so as Warren, Massachusetts is represented by Pocahontas right [noise]\nThose came from Fox and CNN and there were lots more in a video released this week Warren collapse back\nI'm not enrolled in and try and only trying to determine tribal citizenship I

tale of having native ancestors had some basis in truth but not everybody test for personal validation\nTook the test to prove that are families tale of having native ancestors had some basis in truth\nBut not everybody tests for personal validation\nHouse majority leader Kevin McCarthy was in the news recently because the Los Angeles times investigation revealed that since two thousand his

certification for a program designed to help minorities get transportation industry contracts\nTaylor according to the Seattle Times began describing himself as multi racial after taking a consumer ancestry test\nThe test indicated Taylor had four percent sub Saharan African ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as minority so what is a minority then\nThe question really you're asking is that the DNA test tell him what his identity as or tell any of what our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times knows instead DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves or an how others perceive them\nNielsen says home DNA tests or find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't designed them for that\nYou know the sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right out of there also\nFor that you know the sort of gold standard\nGenetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right um they are also um profit making entities\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that\nI Would hope that uh the court is able to take serious way on the fact that these sorts of programs were meant to serve as a counterpoint to discrimination\nBecause the lived experience of minorities can be learned by swapping cheek for speeding into a cheap Karen Grigsby Bates NPR News [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\nThis is cayenne age you Arizona
