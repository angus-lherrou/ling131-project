comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it has given legitimacy and leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had there so a gab dot com\nIs a sort of a basically a Twitter clown um and it is was created under the ...\nSo a gab dot com is a sort of a basically a Twitter clone um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racist begets [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter\nUh for for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know the absolute power of a free speech but when it ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only the sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a a place where white nationalism a\nAnd an extreme or bigotry homophobia whatever ah has has been embraced and and uh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say his name\nWas maybe not radicalize necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nA truly hateful views it was the last place where he posted before the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA an unproductive vent for a lot of that hatred I'm an after after um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming in realizing this for the first time\nA note noticed that are that at this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying ah words are not bullets in social media posts a have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action and I started when they did they actually\nI have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action\nAnd I started what they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWhen it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily in free speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences and then there's sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protect it's so hard if it means nothing I'm ... and I think that that is something that that a lot of people\nDon't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nRabbi Jacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like Gavin get us off the only place where this kind of speech proliferate San line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment a quick First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and ... that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome to folks like you\nShirt well first of all it's not new is that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true it said how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected\nTent wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to spew such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nHas been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae B. T. Q. people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and embolden from the very top from the president of the United states that the white nationalist see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign out before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet\nContent like the very last campaign out before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and light Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states of course trap taps into very old anti Semitic ... yeah\nWell I I I'm Sorry where am I going to do you wanna get a little deeper into that a lot of thought because a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and in the rye love to to get your thoughts at that on that I mean the president\nDid address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism and every other form of\nEvil and unfortunately evil comes in many forms and we come together as one\nAmerican people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning he wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news\nThe fake news

of your questions and comments Constance in Silver Spring Maryland writes\nI Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre it was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced in route as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAG W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be consistent strong resistance to the hateful device of speech that is anti American journalists needs to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating with out strong criticism of the president's

make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to screen very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks so much for having the show I um\nI guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who is both religious the Jewish and also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a strong religious views and close next to the state of Israel I mean I teach at a a small just still here in the city and\nOr in this in the suburbs and a lot of us didn't do feel uncomfortable with House bill that um\nYou know they express a\nStrong and here in state of Israel or especially religious views that aren't um you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you are how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're a Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not particularly strongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school\nAnd they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly if if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's the reason\nA friendly if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence from the left that that's true\nI think you are seeing and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we do we do tell kids who probably should need need to shut up you know an artificial it but the you know you can't argue with that we're\nJust kind of who you're going to have to learn to live with that she's trying to pick your battles I think that's a hard thing\nYeah to pick their battles which I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised to do that and not\nThe non federal everything will do for this book can be can be very hard David let me put that to you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of David Colman\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say Seventy first of all I'm really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course a high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I Want to be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and the left and very often it expresses itself\nAs a as a tax on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not you can criticize any countries policies\nBut often that criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policies we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post\nThe places on the left where where that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out who carry a violent acts and say that they're motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually Jews who are shopping in a grocery store and if you're a store and a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is that it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore\nWho's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. but instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nMake it to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation which has many recalls as we can as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our ancient rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope various religious leaders offered support strings and loved to a community\nAnd our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope various religious leaders offered support strengths and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better\nIndira would you react to that I feel like part of what worked\nI hate to see in Pittsburgh favor but one of the things I think helped in this whole process as you described scroll hill if it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had so in crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to lock arms with one another\nMean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community\nUm it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon University in pit\nAnd a lot of the people who live in squirrel hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentists it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically liberal community and it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton in this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help and Pittsburgh's favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning I'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta\nJust four months ago and attack or killed five reporters and Annapolis newsroom the capital Gazette so you know I Do think we\nJust four months ago an attacker killed five reporters in Indianapolis News written the capital Gazette so you know I Do think we have to worry about drawing a line and I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\nFunding for Kagan AU comes from Prescott import car service for more than Twenty years providing authorized Volkswagen warranty repairs parts in service information about services and appointments at Prescott import car dot com\n\nWhich is Arizona Public radio ...\nIt's good to import car dot com\nThis was Arizona Public radio can a UK puberty Ninety One point seven Flagstaff cayenne eighty Ninety One point seven page gay and AG Ninety point three Grand Canyon and Jay innate you eighty nine point three Prescott this one online at ... dot org for Thirty years of public service of northern Arizona university where it's ten o'clock\n[noise] me too movement has revolutionized how America talks about sexual harassment how much is it changing the laws to protect victims and punish harasser\nFrom W.

A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover and who don't they cover so when you look\nAt workplace sexual harassment lives um title seven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the ... the facts\nBut title seven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees that work very very small employers that are a lot doesn't protect you against sexual harassment and title sudden also\nLawyer has at least Fifteen employees so if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nShe was in ... the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduced legislation in twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states are have introduced legislation as it relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending forced arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York Tennessee California as you mentioned Vermont in Washington\nAnd other states are also looking addict standing training requirements\nUm so how many hours must uh employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that path\nIn um California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from the inner ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor\nShe says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nThought about it and I was like I don't want to post that on my social media it can change your reputation\nSue I thought about it and I was like I don't want to put that on my social media and it can change your reputation I really wish I could protect myself in both situation there just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nProfessor tip it how common is this for freelancers and Nina situation\n[noise] I Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive\nTo provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections are like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaint system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures and Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I Love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University\nThis year BU required all students all staff and all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course\nI had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expanding sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nIs true we have seen this chair and\nLaws expending sexual harassment training and education requirements for for some employers\nThat is true we have seen this year and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of workplace harassment which is exciting that there's been new creative\nUm will to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on is\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there is no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from this long overdue attention she workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in a workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor to but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain types of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment well when you\nHi there I'm Rachel Martin one of the hosts of NPR's MORNING EDITION I feel like a show has worked when we come off the air and I'm

name to strengthen protections against sexual harassment\nWith Emily Martin of the national Women's Law center Suzanne whole scene of the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd University of Oregon law school assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth tidbits we welcome some more of your questions and thoughts as well especially if the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse worked for you or failed you we love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a day or email won a a W. A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reactions to what we heard from California state senator ... Jackson sounds like count California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nI agree that California's ban a real leader\nIn the space both with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session as well as if you love that unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time off and for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week calling for ...\nYou know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week calling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon\nFor other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws in meaningful ways many states and believe that you're targeting in particular [noise]\nWell I think that one of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a past new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and\nSo we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution she was in ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Dirksen\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and\nI'm introducing a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that\nI did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment of workplace in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note to quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitations laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find the conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org vets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me ...\nOn line at the one a dot org vets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure in confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously I Wonder if we can begin to the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities when they're used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\nYes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just called them contracts um or other types of agreements\nMost of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily band nondisclosure and great agreements and hold but just as they relate to this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically ... before we move on to too much for there can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's the type that you mentioned that people find that to start over there and play meant that says keep our information confidential and that was another type that people find usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they've hired a lawyer and those are just settled the person's\n... says keep our information confidential and there was another type of people signed usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they have hired a lawyer\nAnd those are to settle the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct has occurred or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line the case\nFor someone who stick with you for a minute I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or help for hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there may be some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nFor the contracts that you sign at the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that those can't cover sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that so the contracts and away educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person is represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that they like these provisions because it's move the path toward the settlement\nAnd I think that's kind of hard about this is the people who maybe had the most interests and learning us information aren't at a table future backed and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say and whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nLet's get to some of your comments and questions Alix tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier luckily we have to go through sharp training every year\nEarlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier luckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where and when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on email to my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a word conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution do laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on well that's a great\nQuestion if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond set our ally yet there can be complicated questions that arise if a person is usually employed and win state but the harassing or assaulting behavior was in another\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state law stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protection there are core federal protection they should be strengthened in various ways\nThat their core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that is a baseline that covers everybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about\nThat no matter you know what is it because they live in\nA suicide

A. M. U. dot org glad to hear from some of you across the state of Florida\nAbout what you're looking for from the next governor Larry tweeted I Hope that when he wins mayor Gillum will remember the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle\nThey may be the ... parts of Florida but represents a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our state\nThat is a such an important point and I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through the impacts of hurricane Michael er we had Ninety percent of our power knocked out thousands of trees come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week uh we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared\nAnd a sense of normalcy returned to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch a our utility workers or to the western panhandle just west of us\nAre to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region will return we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not that that politically that that is a community that will be for me\nIs of no consequence there Floridians and there were a part of a of our state they is often been forgotten whether forgotten coast would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help to\nWhere the forgotten cos would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help to define in economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of the state of Florida\nBefore we had one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit one of the conversations that constantly comes up whether it was after Hurricane Harvey last year after hurricane Michael this year Hurricane Florence earlier\nIs about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach in of basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in areas that are very much at risk for rising water levels ... Gulf levels ocean levels\nAs climate change progress is and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures of homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the whole world were standing and homes and weren't we're we're we're toothpicks basic that's right that Governor that that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point has\nTo tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here\nYou know it's it's such a fair point uh and and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and light of the fact that we're seeing stronger in and and more increase storms I'm particularly up the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nI but then if then if you tell people where they can't live that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean well less than\nRight now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes I'm Better nice in luxurious and yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk\nAnd yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk for having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm a a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real estate why conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise and climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for properties to be built\nAnd to be built and frankly in an ... way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out\nUh with these increase storm of events and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there's a panacea [noise] I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be having to begin this conversation I think is going to be a statewide conversation and it's one that we're gonna have to lean into with county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor Rhonda ... take part in this discussion or a feature discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly loved to have him on the program\nLet's add one more voice of the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is least Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a\nA Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it\nAnd mayor again thank you I appreciate the opportunity I Do want to note that ah thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties are most of the counties here in the VW all around listening area including Palm Beach Florida Miami Dade County have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida\nPalm Beach brought in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting I'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if the opposing party is in control of the two chambers\nWell one ah Luis good to hear your voice again uh um it to 'em and well aware and thankful for your reminder of the early voting we actually had some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money\nAnd modernizing or a system that is in desperate need of update 'em and I will tell you I'm I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy oh a lever\nI'm here and I spent some time together or for two years making our way through\n'em and Aspen Institute fellowship when we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that to mean that I'm going to convince them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we begin from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will um were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars for health care which is for the state of Florida\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars I'm for health care which is by the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through and he shared the same party or with the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so\nThere there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me\nAnd trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part isn't you know squabbles they want to make sure that we can produce\nAnd and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue you know been public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville\nOr one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you mean criminal justice reform one of the critical points of your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with a law at a young age inform these proposals for updating the state's criminal justice system\nI mean so first I mean it shape it shaped it a lot I think if if you recall from my opening video when I introduced myself I talked a bit about\nYou know watching my mother you know two years well up in her face when uh you know the the ... come by the house and say you know your son's in trouble again right um that that's a difficult thing for any child to have to see and experience\nFrom Arizona Public radio in Flagstaff

I think Trump won putting in thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages\nAre but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today I'm with students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando a hosted an event\nI'm I'm ... I'm a a little while ago and was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... doll\nEr which way it really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us\nIs that in a primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand voters turned out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes\nUm it's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area\nWell but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county and lose another the one who wins\nIs the one who gets one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there will go in because we're going to give voters a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor Gil in so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners perhaps we'll have a chance to talk to you again but one more matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... two questions from\nTwo of our listeners by email Jim emailed mayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already had castle doctrine which allows for individual to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders um onto their property right\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be cleared the difference between what you're talking about just by way of context the castle doctrine you're referring to basically is that kind of your home is your castle idea that says you have the right\nTo use deadly force to defend yourself at home weren't worth stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel ... anywhere you have a legal right to be\nBe anywhere yeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision or about whether or not you consider some\nThat's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCastle doctrine already protect you and your home there's already common last self defense which means\nAnd places where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force there's already case law on the books where you been able and you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force\nBut to not take that two hundred different extreme and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me is is is it is a stretch too far\nUm as it relates to what we can do obviously on that\nI I Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case or to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and help them understand how families like mine and like others who are raising black children\nAnd black and brown children feel particularly a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin and trace of ... the case of murky smug locked in a and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying and are seeing\nA criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies\nBecause they both have weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover for for legitimate illegal practices in our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to ... years as stand your ground as a fan of fans\nWho runs for before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to\nNothing about it because folks are able to ... stand your ground as a ...\nPoint before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say the ... so I Would say one\nYes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to do things like ensure that if you want to carry the power of God at your waist but you ought to have a background check\nTo do things like a convicted a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gun show loophole these are extreme these aren't radical I was too by the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refused to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks\nYou can't you guys in parts for our kids play and our in our families picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about in the front of the second amendment was simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods\nAnd we got her it was some decency here and unfortunately they enter re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency back into it\nGillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate you

A. M. U. dot org\nSarah there was one more thing I did want to ask you before\nWe had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners about their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in granted I Can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that union negotiated for us honorary halfway salary health insurance all that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent it higher level Caesar accountability\nThat will ultimately lead to higher salaries\nMore competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers achieved tenure that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition and the teaching market and ultimately compare ourselves to other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and and like make a couple of comments about that first off I've not always been happy with everything\nOn their laurels well and\nI'd like to make a couple of comments about that\nUm first off I've not always been happy with everything that my union has done\nBut one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers the union is not just your union leaders union movements are driven by members and members need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices um it's actually not that difficult to fire a teacher but what unions has done is made it clear that\nYou can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than\nYou have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or\nYou know and part of the reason that so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay\nAnd if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go see her I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in trying to work with your dog it's about improving policies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think the residents of your speed\nOr really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated and I wonder if it would have taken the strike\nTo make things happen in West Virginia\nI think that they are motivated and I do believe that that is why the strike was so successful we could not have done what we did without the support of our communities and I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media as if this\nWe could not have done what we did without the support at our communities\nAnd I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just it out hey are just about health care it's not about that not just about that it's about improving conditions for students\nFor teachers for families and for working people in general and I had seen with my own eyes\nLegislators repeatedly putting interests that outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate you making time for thanks very much thank you\nLooked at a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but I also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts non union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers\nScott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland ... comment about non union members\nGoing it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union correct me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want\nBut a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right\nI Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um uh uh differences\nTo state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um uh uh differences that you were talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question too I think is an expert on drugs now and she's joining us was NYC in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to want to say\nHey Joshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in in a very upscale district and I hope she makes it run of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to you a little bit more about that in a moment I should also contract I actually I don't really contracts I should also introduced Vincent for new CIO he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\n[noise] hey thank you for having me on principle if I was gives me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to save these or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor now to sealing it\nDepends on what the clause is about ... city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes it's for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's a good con ... ... a context for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage may vary Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the gym is case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier\nWho never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage make very Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the Janice case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house so\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions\nAnything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it\nExcept for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nAnd going back to that contract is a a floor at not sell like uh the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those in the public sector\nHave seniority built in or the only way to get a raise is by logging and other your other job hey I'm andme all the way to go ahead and finish off um so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice\nYou too can be okay you know you

A. M. uses station they care about and so they choose to give and so the barometer we have\nOf whether we're doing what people want is their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to write us into their wells to donate their cars to be you know cashed out to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks and right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you don't have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know that what they're getting from the union they can't get on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument\nSo Joshua it's frankly the arguments and the point that Janice case has ... has decided\nThat you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used today this that if you are creating a staff and I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone\nThen it shouldn't just be that people with the loudest voices that get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just\nThe the people with the loudest voices\nAnd they get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to\n'em or or bar association fees or student loan fee or student organization fees\nThat when you have an obligation to serve all that all pay a fair share and that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the booth case\nAbout forty five years ago and six successive Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it which leads to a gym is overturned exactly so but look Janice\nThat Alito Sam Alito judge of the Supreme Court\nHas wanted this case has asked for this case for years most people thought it was it a a logically base because the issue was really on the outside that that the the case that the Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest about it\nThat the Mackinac center that Donald Trump that others made was that you know the Democratic party used unions as their foot soldiers so let's defund unions that had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want us to a defined us however the cases done\nAnd what has happened since is that members\nHave stuck with unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was\nOr Scott which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center actually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms and laws by the day after the genocide case sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states\nIf we we if we had done that\nPeople would be slapping us around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside of school and what we've tried to do is basically\nWith the slapping us around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside at school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nOkay let me give a ... and the chance to respond to them then we'll keep moving by the way it is worth knowing that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the uh Janice versus ... case but go ahead Vin let me give you a chance to respond\nWell hey thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has their my pay my say dot com website I'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller there's the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy's are trying to trap public employees into paying them or trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under jazz um in some cases in credibly confusing time periods\nOr in some cases only about a week also that\nUm states like New York New Jersey California give unions the ability to essentially have captive audience meetings or make their sales pitch to a public employees while at the same time forbidding anybody else from talking to the employees and this is during the work\nThat way clerk clerk what you mean by a captive audience ... what what exactly are you referring to [noise] um well\nRecent legislation passed in several states gives unions the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with a with new employees so basically think it's time share presentation on steroids where the union can come and", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018",

Johnson in Washington wonder Native American voters thinking about for the midterms much more than what's happening with Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Trump their ongoing feud over Warren claiming to have tribal ancestry\nThe senator has addressed her heritage in the past including at this year's National Congress of American Indians\nI get why some people think there's hate to be made here you won't find my family members on any roles and I'm not enrolled in a tried and I want to make something clear\nI respect that distinction\nI understand that tribal membership is determined by

Pocahontas and said he would give a million dollars to the charity of her choice if she could prove or ancestry that apparently led the senator to take a DNA test who's results she says prove that she is Cherokee\nThat drew criticism from tribal leaders like the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior who spoke on MORNING edition\nUm and then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a Cherokee citizen that's true of oh Indian nations and for a senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA I really

with us mark ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take you\nUsually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back um ah through time\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community is one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important ... one of the things I Love to think about as a shoney's once hunted vested on\nHunted mastodon\nHunted best it I think about that long arc\nYeah yeah I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back millennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether they're intrinsically extra benefits of being an acknowledged member of a tribe that are worth\nProtecting that are worth keeping their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our ... our our children are native languages are traditions are land the water\nTry that are worth protecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA tests is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native you know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it\nThey take our language and they can modify it\nThey take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with some smog and title meant\nLike they've lived the life of a native like somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies out the door\nEven if it's Elizabeth Warren\nShould know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kids the ones that say fine not your ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October seventh things we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from we spoke to a geneticist\nAre named Adam Rutherford who's

frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nUA progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focus on this\n... progressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we were going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you were in progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota has a voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court\nAt decided to essentially and let it go into effect for the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger pause have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve set in the high camp one her race\nThat has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court decided to essentially let it go into effect\nFor the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us rep Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger\nPolls have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve center hike camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American\nAnd so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed it because they said that that north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nSo what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box is they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that I Do you use in the primary is no longer good for the general\nElection a lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years has been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been um talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud\nAnd those addresses are no longer sufficient so if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that idea used in the primary is no longer good for the general election\nA lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has that been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also\nBecause the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even at ... vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast valid and the wrong precinct would would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if you're a mailing address the somewhere different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in

mile from home so almost the end of page eighty three which ends with the word flying would you read that for us please\nA sure anyone and ... when we were half okay when we were half a mile from home in Maryland police cars stopped us just like when they stopped us in Mississippi set up in your seat kept ... kept both hands on the wheel and looked straight ahead\nYou took out your University of Maryland I D and took my red black and green African medallion into my public enemy T shirt you told me to sit up keep my hands on the dashboard don't say a word\nThe officer now down and lifting your window when I saw your face so close to his gun I Want it to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted to super power to melt every gun in the world and the black grits officer asked why we had in Mississippi license plates\nBecause we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say\nI have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park\nHow 'bout done anything wrong officer when officer told you to speak up and claim your change lanes without signaling you kept your grip on the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so I signal and changed lanes officer tried to laugh in your face if he asked for your license in registration\nIs that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came up to staring well and you pointed at officers face move away from my car you said that as much as he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification may not have your badge number please I hated how it sounded when you didn't use contractions the officer as both of us to step out of the car\nAnd said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so I signaled and changed lanes officer tried to laugh in your face if he asked for your license and registration\nIs that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came up to staring well and you pointed at the officers face move away from my car you said that as much how he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification I mean I have your badge number please\nI hated how it sounded when you didn't use contractions the officer as both of us to step out of the car we will not get out of his car you said louder this time we have done nothing wrong\nMy fist were bald up and I was inching toward the driver's side window you slapped me across my chest with the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unconscious office right as another officer pulled up the first officer who is now laughing walk back to the second officers car\nYou eventually showed a second officer your license and your University of Maryland id officer looked at the id flipped it over and told us to have a good night\nNever give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it I wondered why you said it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot your black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you killed yourself\nI hear you I told you and try to make you laugh why didn't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't\nAnd they instead of their though if I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said oh you wouldn't I told you that fool matter because you were speaking correct English you looked at me\nWhere the where you are they will shoot Joe Black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you killed yourself\nI hear you I told you and try to make you laugh why didn't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't\nAnd they instead of their though\nIf I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said we wouldn't I told you\nThat fool got matter because you were speaking correct English\nYou looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English they view though I Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you\nI Am an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me the bubble goods you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't\nWhile I was in my room change and you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seemed like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cutting a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky\nAnd the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style of fly\nOther eggs are heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot\nGoing on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it yeah I mean that's\nWas police weren't the only people doing the shooting\nThey were just the only people allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style\nOf flying I loved our style of fly\nOut of their eggs are heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's the crust of a lot of ah the relationship our talk about in his book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new school and eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd a few my best friends from a previous school were there and one of my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way you did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put a knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers and in that situation I learned that sometimes in off in a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so ah my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEat in a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out and that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom ahead you know you conduct them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to home\nAnd for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so uh my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEating a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out and that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom ahead you know you conduct them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to home life when you spend your entire life outside of the home anticipating white supremacy and white power doing un that's the question I'm trying to asking this section and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom as you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you were trying to understand and how did that affect your relationship with her one way I think\nA lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were right some things that were wrong um she started to be a a a lot more active in trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more\nUm but and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police we could talk about white people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about was like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Flagstaff", "day":

A. M. U. dot for their medical I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization of today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people\nOff you know a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics and the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of it not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI ... in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact\nWe're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really one of the preeminent turnout experts in the ...\nThis year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains that turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by\nAll of this high interest we're seeing high turnout in primaries and in special elections and you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a Pew sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's\nJust said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip\nThe house sure said Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and are particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home\nAnd I'm an off year or mid term here and there's a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republicans ... Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latino African Americans and Asians who are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there are certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats\nWho are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there are certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word of blowouts like you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan congressmen who chairs the Democratic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the house ... but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue wave crashing over a pick up some ten seats or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three at turning the house bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that is it a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue way was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be punk again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public falling shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least those twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when it\nAble to take the at least those twenty three seats in the house uh and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I gained out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year I found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive\nDespite all the talk of cabinet or you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general are doing the God love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough\nHoles in down ballot races even even U.S House but state house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but if it's a Jew and that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own name so I Need to know if the race is close or not if it's a it's an issue where if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need a poll I Need some polls to uh to divide and it it actually changes my vote the poll change my vote\nEllen thanks for your comment Domingo that cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so\nI get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him\nA pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with the horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\nYeah I mean I you know look I mean this is a this is a tried and true a criticism\nUm you know we can get into the science of polling and whatnot and I would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of what the snap shots are within districts in fact\nLow clouds it's odd cross eastern Arizona will burn off around midday temperatures for cats after about ten degrees below average for this time of year low mid fifties Flagstaff Williams Grand Canyon never hunted patchy county mid fifties low sixties around Prescott mid sixties today with the ... valley and the low seventies a little bit warmer and sunny\nOn friday rain showers in mile temperatures over the coming weekend\nSupport for gay and ... comes from northern Arizona University of ... community celebrates homecoming at a pep rally friday October twenty six that five thirty at heritage square the homecoming parade is the next morning at eleven on campus more at any you dot edu slash homecoming\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with a legacy\nThis from of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with the legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learned more at Raymond James dot com\nAnd from the science Sims foundation since Nineteen eighty five supporting advances in science education and the arts towards a better more just society more information is available at size Sims foundation dot org\nBack now to our conversation with Juana Summers of the Associated Press Katie Sanders of politifact and NPR's political months and are all still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the mid term elections email us one a ass W.

P. R. dot org let's get to some of your comments about the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the Dems to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website in the front page does not see what they are for does not tell me what they care about one summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up\nTo the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and how well are Democrats doing an answering it\nI think Laurie is pointing to this actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that and number of the conversations I had I have recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to make sure they have record mid term turnout and they said that when they're talking to voters are sending\nSuddenly wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to make sure they have record midterm turnout and they said that when they're talking to voters are sending out mailers are going and knocking the people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling their voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump's\nBase that um I was talking to some groups that did some field testing recently among Latino voters and they said ... and when they did this field testing they were saying people were turned out they said if they got a ... a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump's face on it\nThey be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that match and you talk about what they can do for them what's at stake that this\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear about health care message I think has Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo medical I Wonder if we can follow up on the scene was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what judge John left in our inbox\nIssued John Ruth sure to New York\nSo often on the shows people for the Republicans the Democrats or Republicans the Democrats the Republicans would instead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies\nNamely the Democrats that stand for such a threat to the Republicans for them for such and such it helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just going Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats\nRepublicans John thanks very much for\nCalling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for X. I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for ... or the Democrats who have done\n... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad\nBrush yeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what President Obama did or regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example or by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy\nThat Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party and twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this mid term\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org the listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advice to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group ...\nI think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a as an Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's\nEveryone's guilty and I don't think any party as a\nAs an Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and it really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do\nA memorable and it's certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here ... years [laughter] it's funny to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nTheir medical research on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... out L G beach acute Kennedy's running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier\nGive us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether or many of these candidates are considered to stay on a strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think of a lot of Native American candidates or you know just a New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man or he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire as a Democrat now\nBut when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected and when we talk about when the when I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women\nWho have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three has been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running\n... that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nI'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers you're basically saying three out of four women\nOf all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic women who've been nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right and the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill areas have been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll\nAnd you know they're going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between here and send them at the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have a female senator in that seat\nBut I Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSo I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates is certainly more on the side of Democrats than Republicans I think that's frustrated\nAnd number of Republican women I spoke to two women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate young promising Republican conservative women\nFrom the local those local level seats all the labs so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list a group that cultivate and backs\nA pro abortion rights when female candidates so there there is some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues at age ...

college degree\nNot and we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of these skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute\nFor workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you\nAnd he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work\nWhen should you consider taking one where do you go to find one you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree on line at the one at a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org\nBefore we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing is a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is it just an aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways than that well I think the main thing that\nIt that we see right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year\nIt's sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about I think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs go yet by so I think that that's a that's\nA woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs go yet by so I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn\nKind of reverse course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in lies to crunch\nGlad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management has been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential ... potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted like his billion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what is manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank Brian can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is\nWe've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity\nPerspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands wage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places\nAre at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes how over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a text club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I\nAm a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offer to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nAnd I think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we just haven't observe that you know overall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups outpacing other industries by big margins are for example ... wage growth in construction and manufacturing has not so different than for the overall economy and I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly ... ...\nWage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions throwing a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but\nAh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that they were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to feeling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can see wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nWhich show emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from a friend who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily were the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you were dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\nOr [noise] well I don't have any empirical data why so many uh employees are working in national traveling there that I Know when I Lived there that it played over half a million or caters everyday into the city and out and many of those that coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we as into the jobs that are out there\nDo you see is the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice\nCan get the people that we have and to the jobs that are out there\nWhen he sees the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat\nYou know I I feel like you know my point of view is I'm going to sort of a wider industry perspective in in a sense that I work in technology for the last ten years and coming to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high end um occupation such as automotive construction\nManufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in India factoring or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about the nature of what we've described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed\nTo all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nAndme us and ... dot org [noise]\nI'm rather young two time Oscar winning out just how we feel dining knew that family memoir\nBut he said as a child she was repeatedly sexually abused\nAs I

conversation with Russ T. Bo and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties they want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street\nIf you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left the voice mail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics in or out and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months and we are really struggling with two items one is employed turnover where there are chasing higher wages and a new facility is a new employers and secondly\nTrying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent has definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us another one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times\nHold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade jobs shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers to the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to want to say\nThanks Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\n[noise] yeah they come home award program that we lost in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship and smiles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarships of talk about and going up but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in a Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon the completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work and it's really a home home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nWe have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we\nBack home to St Clair county yeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we\nWant to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county pay me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron in the St Clair river\nUm our largest town of port Huron has a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did not have a fortune five hundred company in our region a thirty percent of our workforce leaves our county and heads down in metro Detroit to to be employed\nBut they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities are were small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged\nOn the economic health of regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true how\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people they're pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come home program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was the Lancet be government business\nAny other sector we realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and\nSomething to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan it had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nWe're speaking to Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair accounting in St Clair accounting Michigan also still speaking to us T. Bo the president of applied economic research\nAnd Ryan non policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies\nAt the Brookings Institution still time to get in some more of your questions and thoughts\nAbout the labor shortage won a a W AMU dot org tweet us ... when a or comments on our Facebook page where you can watch our video streams so Randy told me how the come home award work suppose I'm from saint Clair townie and I moved to Chicago\nFor work and now I'm considering coming back and how does that work\nYeah Chicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region maybe completed college six years ago\nAnd you're still living in Chicago but you met someone you met a party the medicine they've got other you're you're weighing the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live or you want to come back home settled down start a family spend more time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region\nOr you're eligible for a Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected we give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish a permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up\nAnd then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as a carrot to keep you here\nAnd it's really a simple back on scholarship would pay the loans holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo I Do so\nWell back in scholarship would pay the loans holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo I Do so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time to two years or up\nSinclair county voted this program to come home award will have put in Fifteen thousand dollars towards one's dead I'm guessing it's like would that be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand over time\nThat's exactly Joshua and the goal you know I'm is to really give young people I think it'd be in their twenties or thirties or forties I'm the chance to go two or three years without making that\nNationally I Know you see data says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we received our average at an eighty thousand dollars\n[laughter] that that's a crippling amount of debt preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I'd finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was [noise]\nOh God it was it was the most awful form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will rebel you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know rusty but wants to jump in but before he does Randy I just want to\nAsk you about some of the perception issues that we discussed with regards to New Hampshire\nThere's this ... there is evidence that young people are moving to a bigger cities in in large numbers ... you've talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town

but kind of has gotten lost in the news cycle lately president Donald Trump is a rich man but is he truly a self made man\nThat's been up for debate for some time where he got his money and how much of it came from his father the legendary New York real estate magnate Fred Trump now Donald Trump story has been pretty consistent over the years\nIt has not been easy for me and you know I I started off in Brooklyn my father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay them back and I had to pay him back with interest\nAccording to a recent investigation by the New York times Mr Trump was a millionaire by the age of eight thanks to his father's money over the years Donald Trump received the equivalent of what would be more than four hundred million dollars today\nWhat do we now know about how the president got his wealth how does this report from the times affect his image as being a self made billionaire and for that matter\nWhat difference

turned up around the country in the past few days\nA series of pipe bombs were mailed or delivered by careers to top democratic figures from LA to New York to Washington the bombs were wrapped in bubble wrap and manila envelopes\nThey're attain tended recipients according to the mailings included Hillary and Bill Clinton Iraq Obama Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder democratic donor George Soros democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters former CIA director John Brennan\nActor Robert De Niro all of them have been vocal critics of President Trump\nAt least one package had a district office of Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz lifted as its return address shields as the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee it bounced back to that district office when it failed to reach its intended recipient Eric Holder\nThe bomb that was sent to John Brennan was sent in care of CNN studios on Columbus Circle in New York when it was discovered the entire CNN building the time Warner center was evacuated\nAnd the FBI says additional packages may have been mailed elsewhere an initial examination shows that at least five of the bombs are rudimentary but functional none of the bombs detonated on site and no one has been hurt as far as we know\nNow President Trump urged unity during the White House press conference yesterday\nThe full

society is caused by the purposely false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news and it's gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act\nFast unquote this story is moving very fast and again there's still a lot that we do not know including who is behind\nThe suspicious devices and what message they exactly we're trying to send will keep that keep you up to speed as quickly as we can you'll get more details of course on your NPR member station and online at NPR dot\nOrg let's get\nBack to our discussion about the Trump family empire and the true nature of President Trump's wealth with Susan Craig and must be ... of the New York times we walk more of your questions about this investigation comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nBack to that comment with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's\nShould have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two I mean it it it\nInto the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nRange I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various tax authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire the value that at all over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had and the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business is off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than devaluation can you give us the scent Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of ... writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a\nValuations of you know five ten million\nBut on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nOf course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS then that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond to a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed\nTo assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond to a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking\nWhether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich after the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone riches engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we're talking about here that we uncovered are um trust arrangements that the IRS has endorsed sometimes after being pushed by a trust in a state attorneys\nI'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this grand jury attained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump in his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties there's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on to family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of an pad invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start\nTaking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinda things aren't a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey used a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people the trumps really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that\nThat are well established and widely used by wealthy people to Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in the state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I like to get to one more comment that was sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and their father I see this is a story the second part is taxes

U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this it it is\nTheir job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff does get through 'em and I I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality\nOf the uh the ...\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional toxins certain things was paid when they saw valuations\nThat they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled and and and things move on in the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS um my county as the company where they had they were ... voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the trumps we're doing there so it's sort of a ... a mix of they caught some stuff and and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where\nWe're not convinced they even knew what was going on now that you're\nThey push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or are there statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations on any potential criminal\nCharges those have since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on ah the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which said ...\nUm ... it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been\nFifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings\nI'm would've had to pay some tax would have been a business tax um and it would have been substantially less and it's\nInteresting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not paid taxes on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nIncome so we just don't know exactly what each of them pay but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax if they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how Fred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips and one of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that\nTo us so that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a a payment on a bond basically a money he own oath to lenders and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father's a lawyer showed up with checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and and never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to a full force of the law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area without county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are that they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs\nArea with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are that they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs\nOnto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they ... they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not so there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money the toad so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities\nUm another authorities could be looking at um\nWhere the food they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who would choose to prosecute the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents or with the state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners so if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our other listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none\nSuzanne ...\nComments I had one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump has\nHas stated that he

U. dot for mark before we get into the details of Sergei Skripal is life I Wonder what you make of this story over all this kind of\nCaptured the world's attention why do you think that this got such international\n[noise] well it's an outrage scientists in it or to use that kind of substance on on the streets of a foreign city in order to settle the school I think he's something that a lot of people find extraordinary and you know\nIn in both senses of that was that it's an extraordinary provocative thing but some people\nI think to have trouble believing the British Government narrative in its details I have to say though you know as time has gone on on particularly things we've seen in the last month now\nWith the identification of two suspects and then rushing Janice and experts working to find out the real identities of those people who came to the u._k. on season ends and then to link them to this minute tree intelligence service the geo you you know it'll do seem to be pointing pretty clearly in that direction\nLet's talk more about the G are you what exactly is it and what is it do well at the Russian initials stand for main intelligence directorate\nTalk more about the G are you what exactly is it and what is it do\nWell at the Russian initials stand for main intelligence directorate and it's the it's a direct threats all\nThe Russian general stuff the ...\nOr the ... that are facing some plans for the Russian ministry and this is the same in a lot of countries that historically or the general stuff will have its own intelligence department and that's been the case in changing one or two that bureaucratic details but more or less since the Russians civil war in the early twentieth century\nThat the a Soviet then Russian general stuff has had this organization and ate him price is a whole are sway the capabilities and the idea of a Viet kid reconnaissance so intelligence as practiced by the geo use a very broad concept\nAnd that can be two guys creeping forward on their bellies in eastern Ukraine trying to see if they can ... Ukrainian forces and basically behaving as soldiers on the battlefield\nAnd it can be a guy in a ... tell policy in Madrid\nIn Nineteen Ninety six I eat a ... who was serving that Under Cover of being a scientific and technical for sex tree at the embassy\nAnd it can also embrace things like cyber warfare and spy satellites so it's an organization that has many thousands of people working for it it also has special operations forces or I I\nAnd a very broad capabilities\nSergei Skripal joined the G argue\nWell joining the GI you particularly ah back in the Soviet period when he got involved or he was involved today and in Nineteen Seventy nine\nIt was a pretty mysterious thing you weren't supposed to really know about it you couldn't supply it was them who approach you and he'd been involved he was in the ... and he was a in a reconnaissance unit that did some pretty daring things\nAnd he'd been involved he was in the ... and he was a in a reconnaissance unit that did some pretty daring things like they went into China or on the cover and\nYou know and there are other missions as well but it described in my book\nAnd I think this protein to the attention of the geo you as being the kind of steely guy who who had the right stuff and they invite you to pay me ... an exam and he goes through that later that year he started at the ... what's cool limit it to be diplomatic academy which is effectively that spy school to Moscow\nWet you spent four years uh doing everything from you know the real a spy novel tried cross stuff of agent meats and counter surveillance\nA ... means of communications firm microscopes to secret writing to\nYou know encrypted email all that stuff\nOr through to intelligence analysis and the rest of it so it's a very sorry grounding that they get ... and having done all that\nHe got ... uh in not sneaky full to move to\nA on his first job working on the diplomatic cover and that's what a generally speaking a lot of these gee all you people who have deployed strategic intelligence gathering that's what they do they assume of civilian personnel let's say\nOr maybe ... maybe in the embassy maybe in a trade mission and they carry on with that tree intelligence and ... says all of these people you mentioned in your introduction expelled from the U.S\nA following the soles free incidents ...

A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one at a or comments on our Facebook page regarding the poisoning Martin asks there were five people substantially exposed to the nerve agent in Salzburg one of whom died what's the condition of the others\nMark [noise] um well ah\nSo those people on Nick Bailey who was a police officer who went to this ... house on the day of the poisoning he is a much better but still not ready to return to work\nUh of course a Charlie ... who was one of those\nWho are then found the buffalo or in the summer in June and uh he's ... is the person who died Charlie Rose the lightning Bailey is to have had a very small very small dies so he was a very on well\nPerson who died Charlie Rose the lightning Bailey is to have had a very small very small dies so he was a very on well for a week or two but he also has made a recovery of salts and then of course you get to UT a script pile and ... and uh\nShe was discharged from hospital a several weeks before he was once again I think one can ... from that but to how to a lesser dosage and so I suppose you could say the most serious they affected person who survived will ... himself\nUm when I interviewed the medical stuff there at a hospital you are you how to ... to Stephen jokes\nThey was saying well ah we think that will be long term side effects but it's very hard for us to predict what may also I think one would still say that ... in the prices have come with essence that's my understanding or they're all some long term effects but of course\nYou know if people are not a keen to discuss the specifics that are both because it's an issue of ... medical confidentiality and ah because I think there is still quite a lot of unknowns\nRegard to Yulia ... daughter Anna emailed\nIt's often assumed in the media that his daughter was an accidental casualty however her fiance was a gi argue employee whose mother was also a high level G R U operative\nWhen she tried to reach her fiance from the hospital he and his mother disappear also interesting and it goes on to write also interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as the daughter to London considering that scruples wife and son died earlier somewhat suddenly it seems that the poisoning when the daughter was visiting was not an accident\nThe big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order mark\nThe big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order Mark I'm\nWell I I'll just pick holes in one little bit to them as a description that the the two people are two suspects or did not flying on the same plane as you describe Powell they arrived the previous day at a different London that pool got wake\nOr she arrived then on the science data sowed amounts at Heathrow\nA on a plane for mostly but anyway um\nLet's just talk that ah that's just a detail um look there is definitely something of interest about a half\nArrival in the u._k. and the timing of the attack\n'em and right from the outset people I was speaking to who were involved in trying to work out what has happened investigation or believed that the timing was critical\nNow we know even more so that the suspects are named as ... had been in the u._k. on exactly the same period the last few days of February\n... and the first couple of days in March during the previous year twenty six team I think it probably twenty Seventeen and then another man who's been isolated or identified by Russian newspapers probably a pseudonym so gay few ...\nHad been in the u._k. at the same time as ... or in twenty Seventeen and at the same time late February early March twenty sixteen\nNow this raises questions about or would they ... pounds for some time whether they using the fact that she lived in Russia and therefore they could hack a email account and that's been alleged by the u._k. government that they were hacking it from twenty ... woods and\nIn Russia and therefore they could hack a email account and that's been alleged by the u._k. government that they were hacking it from twenty ... and indeed him ... fun [noise] um she seems to have come back to be with her daddy Shia around that time because his brother Sasha how to use the stay on the first of march [noise]\nSo that's the ... uh by a late twenties Seventeen I'm fortunate they tragically a Sasha by the way had died but it's still supposed that she had come in twenty Eighteen to be with that at that time because it would be a difficult time because it was a time they were normally together as a family\nSo that the that it's always been um a a a line of inquiry for the investigator is that the\nTiming of the attack was critically linked to use his arrival that are hacking her data bugs emails and stuff which said show outcome that you are from the ... would help them to locate so make sure he was not a business trip or in some other way absent\nAnd uh that this would be a good time to do it now and I also mentioned a boyfriend that I'm Yulia had bought a is a bit of a cab yet he is sold by some to have had connections with a one of the Russian intelligence agency thought\nHe was not on the scene for example back in twenty six dating when it's believed that this um figure I'm using the names of traveled to the guy\nHe was not on the scene back in twenty Thirteen when we know according to the u._k. government\nThat her email account was hacked or he hadn't been on the scene so much more than a year so\nYou know we don't know and no fan of he's not here to defend himself against any allegations that he had played some policy in these um but we know\nAre here to defend himself against any allegations that he had played some policy in this um but ... we know that after the attack um [noise]\nUh well nearly a month off to there was a ... hearing to do with medical procedures that to happen and it was ... that he had not been in touch with the hospital for example to find out how she was\nSo the idea that he kind of a vanished from the scene seems to have some substance\nOr you'd have had access to the Internet since a fairly early on in a recovery we don't know whether she's reached out to him or whether indeed they often ... by a social media or messaging or or email or whatever uh but we have to assume that they no longer income tied\nTo a few more of your comments and questions from our urban another mark tweeted you got that out quick if it's half as good as your previous books it will be a pleasure and an education to read [noise]\nFeel asked listening to this broadcast I was wondering if we knew why it was that he decided to defect to and my six mark you kind of suggested that he had kind of had
