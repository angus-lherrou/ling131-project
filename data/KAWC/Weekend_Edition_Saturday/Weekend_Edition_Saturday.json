prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described effort by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter budge to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including issues raised in sports Andrew bitten sports reporter\nFlew into Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem beaten joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took a knee or not during the plane of the anthem\nWell at first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well what we found\nWas these tweets had begun all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA failing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\n... so it it it wasn't direct the TV and a certain result just to to stir things up apparently yeah\nAnd the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed direct yeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole one closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the clubs and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on Twenty years is not a lot of time\nThey would continue to weigh in Andrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nTwenty years is not a lot of time if you're say Betty White\nYou know what the gift for twentieth anniversary is drier

sober thoughtful\nNews exactly we knew that people just didn't take NPR seriously enough with all your frivolously\nAnd hide jinx so we decided that we needed to finally try to acquire a reputation for sober consideration at this network and I'm Glad to have done it\nThanks so much I'm curious question yes um there are serious chilling events a school shooting range church bombings in this week although thankfully no one's harm bomb threats so much harder than others to have fun\nWith the news Oh yes but we know that we have a particular role or handling all that stuff\nThat's your job and we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff in focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst the news and sometimes it's been very bad\nThe more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring the silly you've had so many um famous gas including of course of a president of the United states to two presidents of the yeah we had the rock Obama before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to me since [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared to host the presidency that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job in the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill

Trump won among traditionally democratic union households in the state and bears Don Gonyea reports from Lorraine Ohio\nTwenty sixteen was an election Ohio labor activists would just as soon forget Democrats count on a big boost from the votes of labor households but Donald Trump with the talk of killing the north American free trade agreement and bringing back coal and steel jobs carried the

CIA oh he says Trump's win here was disheartening\nBut this year the unions are taking a more focus more personal approach to politicking as a result and he says he gets why so many union members

is pumpkin spice in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ad these days it's not negative am I just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nHave you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV [noise]\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tend to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in midterm campaigns\nFor younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online there's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season on through\n[laughter] uh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as a centrally being\nConnected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack\nIs not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean well yeah this is uh\nAds and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it is a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television has to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us my pleasure and Tamara weekend edition Sunday literally looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us and how we speak to each other\nYou can listen to that story tomorrow morning by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name [noise]\n\n\nAnd it's time for sports [noise]\nThe art of big then by the

Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteen pictures used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter it isn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight [laughter]\nWell the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill\nAfter the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still haven't decided who he's starting later today in game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes Nathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker ... we got a dealer builder [laughter]\nIf I was a brilliant this with two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team it's ever come back in the world series from a three hour deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal\nWhen with Walker Mueller beings started then I does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win the ... that's a good question to ask a either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but\nBecause they both put absolutely everything and more into this game LA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but\nBoth teams are stocked with professional baseball

I Know you and the other members of the media going to be on the scene it must be hard to get to gain access but I gather that to police and and perhaps the mayor will be having a press conference right\nYes there are represented from the police department here governor well uh it's actually also here and I'm told that I'm the mayor if you're obviously but I'm told that either a politicians and lawmakers from the area are making their way here to offer as much help and support as possible\nLucy ... one of our member stations W E essay in Pittsburgh thanks so much for being with us Lucy we uh will follow the situation throughout the day\nThinks that\nTwenty years is not a lot of time if you're say Betty White\nYou know what the gift for twentieth anniversary is drier Lynch\nAnd we have a whole load of it on our way to Peter Segal in this group because to show that follows us in many markets and I don't mean Kroger are safe wait wait wait don't tell me\nIs celebrating his twentieth anniversary with a special episode will even include a few laughs Peter Sagal joins us now from the studios of Chicago public radio Peter thanks very much for\nTwenty years of sober thoughtful news ...\nExactly we knew that people just didn't take NPR seriously enough with all your frivolously\nHide jinx so we decided that we needed to finally try to acquire a reputation for sober consideration at this network and I'm Glad to have done it\nThanks so much I'm curious question yes um there are serious chilling events of school shootings church bombings in this week a low thankfully no one's harm bomb threats so much harder than others to have fun with the news\nOh yes but we know that we have a particular role handling all that stuff\nThat's your job we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff and focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring the silly you've had so many\nUm famous gas including of course so oppressed\nAnd to step up to the plate and really bring the silly [noise] you've had so many um famous gas including of course of a person of the United states to two presidents of the yeah we have the rock Obama before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to me since [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared to host presidency that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions they're inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case that for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah how could you not and I miss Carl Kasell\nWe all you've had some great partners I have and I've been blessed and I have stood on the shoulders are next to the shoulders\nGiants as everyone knows a not only was Carl Kasell original judge and scorekeeper he was our presiding spirit and he still is even though he's no longer with us\nAnd bill Curtis has a voice that's on loan from the heavens and he also much like Carl\nHas a really interesting sense of humor gosh yes yes and he runs a little shall we say salacious I Believe that the public radio word will use and every now and then our audience gets a glimpse of that but my favorite thing is when off air he'll let loose with the profanity\nAnd it is stunning to hear that voice using that language oh my gosh you can it can boil the hair right off the what's quite fun before we go who richer the music the music of course",

Kavanaugh seems to be on a clear path to be confirmed for the Supreme Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Meghan ... column for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we welcome and enjoy just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you were at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause and the Senate vote to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Christian bus before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter]\nUm what was that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nI don't think so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than look to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're saying that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job [noise] I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and some people say it wasn't a\nI Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true on the other had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically to get the crowd I wasn't aware of the fact because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen to those and they tend to should\nPeople there basically to his of cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph\nAnd she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without the thing that I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provide\nSo they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without the thing that I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian Bussey Ford a sincere uh but that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have necessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible on and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in that neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy in being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews they're Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrent um but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for Kavanaugh is gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with\nFord has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth um it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the colonel thanks so much thank you turn to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece\nWith us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor of Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily their head or of this one I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts of that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump use a variety of tax shelters\nAre a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump passed on several hundred million dollars to his children he could do so in a way that allow them to avoid\nStory or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters\nAre a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump\nTasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid or around fifty million or so\nAnd when when Donald represent over the years I've built would I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is\nThe president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognize and that may be people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\n[noise]

just don't think that it's reflected in this decision\nDoes you're probably continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers do\nOur fight does continue to sell uh as far as the Senate go he ... he kind of knew that he had he kind of pattern because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis and so he\nKind of the early I Believe an opioid addiction\nShe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and that he's just a bad guy and I think he knows\nHis old camp though this is old your opinion with me underscore\nThat do of course this is my opinion yes of course um\nSo yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue or yeah so we're working on I'm working at a state wide to change things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell it it it sounds as if you have accepted

Employment Opportunity commission have gone up twelve percent\nThat's after years of remaining steady the EOC is the government agency that handles workplace discrimination cases including sexual harassment\nThe vast majority of those claims do not go to litigation but even the number that do it doubled this year the EEO sees acting chair Victoria ... says the interest generated by me to has been enormous\nWe've had a five fold increase of hits to our website of people looking for information about sexual harassment we've done hundreds of training sessions for employers\nHere's something else that has changed as a result of me too there's a real money available for women to get help says Sharon to Johnny\nI've been a civil rights lawyer and women's rights lawyer for the last Twenty

for legal help\nSome people are coming to us you know two years after this has happened to them for five years after this has happened to ten years after this has happened to them\nBecause they never felt comfortable coming forward before and the way the law is you have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of time that some of those women are out of time\nSome of those women who are coming forward are independent contractors and unless you live in certain states you're not covered by discrimination law and so it's a matter of people coming forward and we connect into lawyers and the lawyers help them when they can but sometimes there isn't something that can be done\nYou got a plow the ground and plant the seeds before you can read to harvest\nJoe Freeman has written books on

battle didn't\nYeah they sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be haven't seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox did the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down\nAnd obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox and relief pitching really almost gave it up there at Yankees had chances in the sixth inning bases loaded bases lives

pitcher got clue or club at you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and they gave me the Yankees won a hundred games but the actual still won a hundred but they went under and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line up to the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot of ... that a lot a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem

National League champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm\nAt the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with that I kinda like what the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the

court but uh this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact for generations couldn't\nOh yes we assumed the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents to named to Bush and out to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members are alumni of the federalist society who it's been which has been growing for some of the court for years and swelling presence on the federal bench that it's lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own\n... what do we need to know about the federalist society especially is they're going to be um more prominent than ever and us live\nOr the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students in Google's legal scholars\nOf people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of the few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations\nAsking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let let's underscored there's nothing remotely secret about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population\nUm if Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get out to the polls about a month from now

allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Meghan ... column for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we welcome entry enjoy just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you were at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported or the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Christian bus before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter]\nI'm wars that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't\nThink so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's all\nI mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it doesn't look to possible\nThat they should confirm me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job [noise] I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't a\nI Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true on the other had both of them had testified at length and you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative\nBy not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of the fact because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen to those ... should\nPeople basically to his of cooperation were her therapist notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not with Kevin ... name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took but she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph\nAnd she would not provide the therapists notes\nTo the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNo the world from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible on and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in that neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy in being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews for Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to rent\nIt's crimes first of all that's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrent\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for Kavanaugh gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth um it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the colonel thanks so much thank you turn to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece\nWith us now to talk about some of the allegations Distomo Brian he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat's easily the head or of this one I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters\nAre a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump\nPassed on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid around fifty million or so\nAnd when when Donald Trump has said over the years I've built that I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that if Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is\nThe president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you that you can recognize and that may be people going over the story now can recognize just distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when Fred Trump and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an exam\nThe building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests\nThat that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used\nTo inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their armada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay\nStay tuned for wait wait don't tell me coming up and twenty minutes you're on K.

Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court [noise]\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan we're prince and on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial and natural and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment that we live at\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes it can of ... ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the

at\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes you can't have a avoid getting sucked into very big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether\nThe employment

I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro terrible shooting in Pittsburgh bombs in the mail this is a fraud political moment and here to help us make sense of it as NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson good morning thanks for having me [noise]\nSo obviously I'm a terrible news out of Pittsburgh we got the names of those who I'm actually were killed by this in this attack\nYeah let's just make a few things clear this was the worst anti Semitic attacking us history it occurred just days after the largest\nAssassination attempt on political leaders in this case all Democrats and targets of the presidents in us history and we're not going to have the big debate about whether extreme rhetoric including some of the president's rhetoric\nHelped insight this but the president has made a lot of unifying statements\nHe said these acts were evil he has also gone on to campaign and hold rallies kind of partisan politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did but just before\nA rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nI Would like to be able to have its own that I have because I feel very strongly about it\nAnd I'd have a much different John frankly the press was\nEven handed the press was fair I'd have a much different tone all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault but as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there is what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh a posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted with out\nThe shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\n... this is the president who has not really embrace the role of United and chief\nNo he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role as sort of the moral leader of the nation but he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change she's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes it energize his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race and fear of crime fear of immigration and it's kind of a social media business model you know the algorithms that YouTube and and other social media organizations know that more extreme content keeps viewers\nOn longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and that he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you know mid term elections are just over a week away will live and to this past week affect the elections and if so how\nI think for the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were on a roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs\nSo that might be the biggest effect\nNPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson ... thank you so much thank you\nThis morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case his ... is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story would turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning\nMourning with the [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how does one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source that uh he apparently was making them in his man and there's no sign yet or any other help\nAre we getting a picture of how he became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a\nSoccer and body building in nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a and a political anger starts coming out in in social media wants thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of of Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nThat's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the north\nSouthern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in ... in the community that had that horrific school shooting this year that's only about Fifteen miles away sort of in northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale and say I begin making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you suddenly co workers including one who was in that town\nYet Deborah gr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza\nWill say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nThat's like hello hey last Hitler Hitler\nWe should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much\nThank you lose the leading up to them it turns this election season we've been looking at what voters will find on their ballots the big governors' races the different kinds of ballot measures well we've just got today and one more Sunday before election day so it's time to look at the too big a house and Senate\nWill do the Senate first and we'll do it with NPR lead political editor and medical not to narrow good morning to medical good morning ...\nA third of the seats and the senator up as the constitution required Democrats are facing some tough mass but then we started hearing about a blue wave how's that water looking\nWell look the blue wave is certainly real but it's more likely to be in the house then in the Senate and that's because in the Senate there are a lot more uh seats that are held by Democrats in red or states that are up you have the worst landscape since the direct election of senators\nIn Nineteen fourteen for either party that's because you have twenty six Democrats that are defending ... seats and just nine Republicans so will the Republicans pick up seats and\nIt's very possible in fact a you know some handicappers are looking at a potential a best case scenario for Democrats being net even right now it's fifty one forty nine in the Senate\nAnd are more likely scenario something like two to three seats lost from when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of that cycle and through the cycle they were hoping to sort of be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscape and twenty Eighteen where they could go on off as\nThe best target for Democrats is in Nevada with Dean Heller and Heller is actually started to do a lot better a lot of those Republican a defense is a lot of those those Senate seats or Arizona Tennessee Texas Nevada they all started to try and a little bit more Republican in recent weeks while Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp\nHis Jewish a lot of big ideas if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry

C. dot org and from Americans for the arts\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm little Garcia Navarro in these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by ... Hannah Jones she covers rate for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters ... but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true yeah\nAnd and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\n[noise] well I I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly\nIn our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this is also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in his country until forty years ago but why voters also hear the racial implications of that\nAnd so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not\nActually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nSo how did those two things then sent when you're trying to discuss some of these racial divisions in this country\n[noise] one I Would clearly argue we're all biased\nI think the way that we covered the election showed that by to be very Larry clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally where voters on the ground were saying right ... voted on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about it\nIt's it's economic anxiety so that's biased but also when we talk about fairness is it fair\nIs it accurate to say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about a segment of those voters were white\nTo me that is not fair it's not fair to all of the people in a country that at this point is about forty percent non white who we are rendering invisible and our coverage\nNicole Anna Jones of the New York times magazine thank you so much thank you very much for

God well visiting the shouted conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage\nPresident Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing he did not\nCriticized the Saudis and beer down gun Jay was what the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saturday's the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious that Mr showed jihad died or in their custody he at the at the embassy and I stumbled\nThe pressure was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people you know a lot of people involved that I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called ... unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment worth a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand just\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to facts are facts are as the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer ally in Canada Germany over trade and the like a not so with\nThe Saudis now all of this comes up as the president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talk about how does he present his argument at his rallies he\nIs really trying to get the a C is hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh you now calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in ...\nSure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh you now called Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob\nAnd I can tell you the rally crowds love that language or any talks about that that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border\nAnd lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nI demographic three you know that would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and ah\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of your mouth ...\nAnd here's John ... thanks very much for being with us that you've got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death in your mouth to show gee\nWe turn now to ... he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council on global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us\nGlad to be here based on all of your experience there's the Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than they kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that or was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president\nOf how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which\nBy the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there was a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to\nA point of value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how\nCitizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in in\nThe rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments\nA that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps them talking\nAbout the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior and top two weeks is unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nThe state of depressed 'cause we've got a new ad campaign to encourage tourism or at least not disappoint those who do come to visit one ad shows a happy half dozen people floating downstream in an empty livestock tank that's apparently\nI never ask a cruise ship with the headline lucky for you there's nothing to do here John directs the state's tourism directors says their ad campaign had to strike a different note because not a lot of people say they think visiting Nebraska he says I called bunk on that\nWe have the same blood and is that we have different stories we have a similar

with us good to be with the Scott let's begin to of course with the president's reaction to the Saudi explanation as it stands now it's been in several different places for the past couple of weeks for the death of ... of the president calls it credible lumps in Congress don't\nThe Saudis say he was killed in a fist fight with Fifteen men\nAny child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of the story the Saudis have now abandoned\nIts intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual\nAnd that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week while he was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this\nThose weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is focused\nBut president made that clear this week by spelling out his agenda like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense\nAnd a president and another Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop\nAs for law and order that's the phrase is older states rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the phrase has also been used\nAs code for resistance to social change and common sense is another familiar phrase a recently used as a political casual\nBy the Tea Party as you mentioned round the care of and has been a feature of the the rallies that President Trump has been addressing but\nHe's also threatened to withhold some foreign aid over it has me\nYes the stopping the caravan and the threat of withheld assistance is substituting right now for the border wall which the

Arabia's offered an explanation for his death\nIt's only a first step president wants to gather more information before deciding how to respond to members of Congress have called for sanctions on the Saudis so far the administration's appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space\nThis week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least a friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince ... reporters on his return to the U.S the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWe have a long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ...\nIs right about that for decades us presidents from both parties who felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly endless stand resident of the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite a bit about this sort of transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or have to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things had a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military [noise] those are the biggest orders of the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the kingdom has pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like ... men lucid motors Saudi money also\nThe kingdom as pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like uber than lucid motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy says Rachel Bronson author of the book sicker than oil America's uneasy partnership with Saudi Arabia\nThey invest in long term goals they invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museum they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War of the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed former President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran but Brunson says Trump has embraced the kingdom more tightly whenever\nThe Trump Administration has put all of their ... basket and they've been very very public about that\nTrump has sided with Saudi Arabia and its regional fight with cutter and encourage the very public romance between his son in law Jared Kushner and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... as the president said yesterday before the Saudis acknowledged the show ... death that makes it tough for Trump to crack down now\nSay there's been a great ...\nSays this is so\nSad but Bronson says Saudi Arabia was all ready backsliding on its pledges of modernization which is part of what made ... so critical\nWhich I'm On the show the represented for many of us flies this belief in managed change in Saudi Arabia which is very slow he couldn't be patient and he he expected to be patient and when he didn't expect with their reversal that he was seeing with behind in some on\nTrump says he will listen to congressional calls for sanctions against the Saudis and that he wants to work with lawmakers even as the president stresses he

that the child to being on a waiting list for and live a diner for three times the average and the child with getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated\nAnd we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat if the parents tell you\n[noise] so the parents saying to us why ... we're well controlled well HIV positive

G. God well visiting the Saudi conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage part of the Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing he did not\nCriticized the Saudis and beer down gun Jay was what the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saudis the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious mister show jihad died or in their custody the pressure was asked about it will turn an air force base\nI think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people you know a lot of people\nUh in their custody the president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big said a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters that around cable with defense industry officials at that base he called the showed used at the unacceptable but also right away scot pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhere the hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks or as the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting given given up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like a not so with\nThe Saudis now all of this comes up as the president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talked about how does he present his argument at his rallies\nHe is really trying to get the base his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in on hinged\nAngry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language or any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border\nIn lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of a ...\nAnd ... John ... thanks very much for being with us thank you got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of your mouth to shrug gee\nWe turn now to evoke the older he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us a lot to be based on all of your experience just the Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham gee died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think\nOne of the questions to be asked is the quick\nSecretary of state or a bump pale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president\nOr how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh than how much in Washington because it seems to me like\nBoth Washington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWell at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis the end\nThe indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have\nIf we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership or in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey that Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a but it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments\nA that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen the top two weeks\nIs unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nInstead of your breath because we've got a new ad campaign

addiction can be just about any fish in a ritual that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week\nIt included a photo of the smiling face of metal to blend in there with her toddler son Hayden was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for money but you're suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and production ... high school party\nA drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and limbs to near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kate O'Neal Rosie ... and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to saying how she wanted to be\nAn actress and starring Broadway musical and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs and it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but\nWhat happened we had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she can\nOxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we're all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program I go there to ... yeah she tried many what made you sure all of this and you're a bridge or\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define the way she lived\nAnd said to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ...\nTo people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people in that part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise] understand there's going to be a service for ... Sunday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nThrough song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate songs is just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now\nAnd I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing\nSource of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday ... rich on there [noise] I Can't make you left
