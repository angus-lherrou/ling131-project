christopherson right now and she's really a supported the legacy of many artist so the idea of her working on the tributes on record the certainly appropriate for her\nWe'll have [noise] and I see and I see around\nAnd so you're you're Tom tell me about your interest in the Memphis Sound and you as an artist you are interested in the Memphis Sound you're interested in the music that Sam Philips brought forward or through the vehicle of sun record say this is something you were interested in this little kid or does come out\nWell yeah I mean I wasn't fully aware of what's on records was when I was a kid I was familiar with some of the music but it wasn't until I was\nYou know a teenager that I and I was playing music already that I've sort of study to Doug in and started realizing this was all under one sort of umbrella you know the stuff that I heard was vaguely aware of it as a child\nI became obsessed with and then when I realized it was all one thing I was like oh wow I'm not\nCompletely completely changed my whole way of saying about music like it does for anybody that really delves into that catalog but um that was a before I ever move the Memphis and then I moved there about twelve Thirteen Years ago and\nI'm just really got to be a full time student in Memphis music and get to be immersed in it and around some of the people that made it and it's just been a real uh\nUh it's been an amazing sort of experience as a musician living there and soaking up the Memphis thing kind of being an outsider but now can totally considering you know I'm you know but ah yeah and and then the Memphis sounded so broad you know you talk about another sound but there's more than one son records is one thing and if a state of unrest stacks records Hi Records are to\nYou know there's the the uh there's there's not a Memphis Sound there are Memphis Sounds you know\nWell and here we are celebrating one of those sounds as as delivered by Sam Philips and has a record label son records Amy you worked at sun records as as a tour guide let's talk about the recording studio room where all of this magic happened Roy orbits and Johnny Cash\nJerry Lee Lewis a course Elvis recorded his stuff there's not a big room\nNotice this stage you might be bigger than the actual tacking round one car garage really was radiator shot it was a ... law\nIt has these white stick tiles I'm a law aimed at forever his best day this child\nAnd the ending was real and had this little metal peaks and valleys all along the tap into the room like how they found in there and then one big glass window in family ... looking through the window with the band\nAnd the way was the way the room was portrayed in and walk the line which you were part of the motion picture and one of the actresses and in that that movie that was a very accurate portrayal of of the room and the way Sam Philips work with the artists\nAnd why they actually and I actually knew senator sat\nDown there and they built it pretty they built a whole nother studio down names treatment they were the storefront to look just like it inside there because they honor is fine with respect for people\nLooking through the window with the band\nAnd the way was the way the room was portrayed in and walk along which you were part of the motion picture and one of the actresses and in that that movie that was a very accurate portrayal of of the room and the way Sam Phillips work with the artists\nAnd why they actually um I actually knew senator set\nBuilders and they built it pretty they built a whole nother studio down main street meant they were the storefront to look just like it inside there because they the owner is fine with respect to the people that come from all over the world\nTo see time studio that he didn't want to curb it to the public\nFilming said they had to build that\nThey had to build their own\nWe had to record the sun sessions at night after seven after they've finished the tours courage though we did the daytime ...\nOperating studio the Iranian idea but only at night do they do they have to do they have the same recording board that they had the old arc deal to this whole new stuff yeah ... yeah old stuff new old\nDon't have the actual the actual gear they do actually have one of the portable recording devices that needed to go around and make field according to bring it back in the museum and that's really cool things in the studio at\nNew all the actual console that same additives that the rock and roll museum\nThat they actually do exist as just just not they're not operators amazing I give props were props has do again I mean it's amazing how good those records found even today on the modern sound systems with the gear that they had to record back then\nSo it was a combination of really great songs really great musicians and Sam's ears and the engineers that he\nHe worked with well it's a it's an album that does a fitting tribute to that legacy it's called red hot it's a tribute to Sam's tulips and the music of sun records and we're going to turn our attention to John Paul Keim is a tune called red Cadillac and black moustache right here on the wood songs old time\n\nUh then oh alone childcare there is a good thing you do me around\nA\nHuman than what it was a um\nYou real to care\nUsing drew\nYou use\n...\n... do you add the regular day

guitar\nWell I think ... the age of eight nine and then I came across in videos of people like Tommy manual and Jay Reed and ... and it really caught my attention I thought it was such a cool thing

everywhere to be on our stage you don't have to be famous to be on with songs you just have to be very\nVery good we've got an incredible singer songwriter from Nashville to introduce to you and amazing would songs kid\nFirst up there we're going to dip into some genuine American music history\nAs based here in Kentucky it's the sounds of jug band jug band started at the turn of the century became very popular around Louisville, Kentucky and continues but you have heard the sound in popular music\nIt started in the Nineteen sixties with the sound of a great group called a loving spoonful John Sebastian and his drug ban one\nDay for day during\nThey dream in Britain long ago\nJerry had a huge hit with the judge downtown\nGreat music great sound coming from\nA historic there's music [noise]\nThese guys carry on that tradition were very very proud that they could be here we're going to talk to them about jug band music and what it means to Americana and American music they're going to do a tune from a brand new album is called jugs up this is called a washed board man please welcome from Louisville, Kentucky the juggernaut jug band on the Woodstock\n\n\n\nPlay ball with their lives on his hands grains around the time and often avenues saying I Love to hear that man [noise]\n\n\n\nHappy and everything is going to do the random oh man\nHappy and everything is the last man\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nWell he'll tell you change\nMan usually make you feel just fine\nLives do the ...\nThe the odd thing is that you actually accomplished you superseded all the expectations in you became a big success as far\nSo you're driving\nIs supposed to talk about the the Allen Jackson cut because a lot of times a lot of times um you write a song an artist likes it and they kind of put a hold on it for a while yeah and it's sort of precludes another artist from recording it so you had an artist technically put a hold on on a song\nThat came to Ellen Jackson's attention tell him tell\nMe how that happened that was actually on hold for two other artists for the year proceeding when Alan herd it out of a publisher at the time who played for Allen's producer and he put it on hold on for another artist at first but it turned out they weren't sure about the timeline for that album and what was going to go on\nSo he was out to lunch with Allen one day and said I got a song I Would love to play for you to get back to the office in\nAllen really liked it and the other artists was gracious enough to say you know what I don't know exactly when it's going to be cutting so I don't want her to miss that\nWhen I was a song Monday morning church was a beautiful beautiful\n[noise]\nWaiting for something that you knew that there were art is interested in the song and you're waiting and waiting and you it was killing\n'em know again I didn't really know anything at that point in time Alan actually ended up hanging out on spring break my senior year in college\nAnd would tell me about the first time you heard it you're you're probably in your car like everybody else and listening to the radio\nAnd actually a dairy Overton Eddie amount of kind enough he got a copy of it because he's worked with Allen for years and he cannot stand by me and to hear that cut and you know it's a really it's a strange thing it's almost like\nYou're watching a TV show or maybe somebody hooked up a computer and ran ears song through it and made it sound like somebody else it was it was really amazing\nWhat about the first time you heard it on the radio you heard Allen singing your song on the radio\nWell I I don't know if you've seen a movie called a thing called love but it was about like that I'm driving down music row and heard it and\nWe were actually on music growing here yeah wow the talk of the serendipity those stores were lining up for you that\nAnother claim to fame that you had and this kind of important in Kentucky and all because he was the voice of Kentucky tourism now but you were a Chris Stapleton upstairs neighbor I was yeah so so what was that like he must have been an interesting uh fill it down through probably singing and working all the time really helped me carrying a wardrobe upstairs nice guy\n[laughter] so what let's talk about the changes in the music business because I mean the last ten years has really\nAffected the ... not the music and the musician so much because they're still there and they're still passionate and they're still working and trying but the music industry itself has really changed music grow has really changed it's interesting\nAh you know there are good things and bad things about it it's you know technology is changing so fast um\nYou know I think about my granny growing up she didn't even have a radio when she was born and are want all we can do today and it's really amazing to think about all the innovation that happened and I to me I think it's a good thing because I think there's a lot of possibilities for independent artists that maybe weren't there before\nYou you have a lot of independent nature in your career and so I mean you're getting major cuts with with important artist but but you are a singer songwriter that also\nYou have a lot of independent nature in your career and so I mean you're getting major cuts with with important artist but but you are a singer songwriter that also views yourself as an artist as as one of those performers\nThat's what I moved to Nashville for I\nI really I started writing songs to have things to saying and I'm I think I was lucky in that way because maybe I didn't know ... when I was trying to write I just tried to write something\nI Love that I'm kind of fell into it\nSo now you have ah you you have the series of of a single vote you sort of releasing on your own one of the time told me about that don't tell me what you're doing there\nBut I put out an album last fall called with the town crier that I'm really proud of Jimmy Johnson a gym is brown ... already said that say that I was a kid in the country music candy store get to do that has got to have all my favorite players into play got some friends of mine\nA critic came in saying on a couple of songs and rainy Hauser and Ricky Skaggs was just a really special experience and then since then I've been recording some\nKind of one off more to stick base songs or just because you know as an artist it takes a long time to do an album that you want to have something new and fresh she wasn't fresh baked cookies out their share with your audience will\nAllen Jackson even sit in one of the songs lordy don't the wheels turn slow and hey that's a that it is true and it takes a lot of uh there's a lot of work being patient\nThrough the through the process but speaking of whiskey town cry which is a great great title because that's that's what they used to call people who shouted out the news yes back in the ... is that how you view this album is sort of like a ... claiming the in the news or or the state of a community\nYeah it's actually it's a theme to record and so it's basically supposed to be an auditory newspaper for a small town and I'm really big into characters in story song so each one of these songs could be\nA little a article\nIn the local paper a lot of places that we can recommend living things like that it's like well a\nHeartache cells pretty good these days so now you've got this beautiful album is called whiskey town cry or you're going to dip into that album for this particular song is called ... just like a cowboys Aaron enderlin on the with the song sold her\nNew day come he didn't\nI Love you know\nThat my knees and\nBoots and again in ... he was\nSaying that in ... and then even though many times these ...\nHated

lot of the well you'd think yes and and I mean but what I was told what really killed him in ... or traffic lights they used to\nUse the group up on street corners and and the police would have to come around and tell them to move off the street corners because they were interrupting the the uh\nCars they didn't want to abide by the traffic\nSignal insistence on obeying the law killed jug band

I mean explain this well [noise]\nI don't I've got a lot of explaining to do I suppose [laughter] there's there's a a ancestor to the hammer adult summer in Europe called the symbolism and it's a real central uh instrument in a gypsy Roma culture\nParticularly in the Eastern Europe or regions are in folk music I'm so there was a real strong connection in terms of a gypsy culture with its instrument what you'll find a less of is the application of hum a gypsy swing the jazz stuff of Django on\nThe instrument so when you first tried it\nHow much whiskey was involved\nIn trying to take Shane goes music and interpret it on a hammer adults were cause I mean what what he's doing with two fingers on frets you're doing with hammers yeah two cameras though so maybe it won't have to harm us two fingers so seriously this is this is a complicated thing that you're interpreting yeah this is not easy\nYeah no I I avoided it for years and I'm\nA good friend of mine in Chicago alfonzo pun a chili he kept\nSwing the jazz stuff of Django on instrument\nSo when you first tried it how much whiskey was involved\nIn trying to take Shane goes music and interpret it on a hammer do from a cause I mean what what he's doing with two fingers on frets you're doing with hammers yeah two cameras though so maybe it won't work to harm us two fingers Seattle seriously this is this is a complicated thing that you're interpreting yeah this is not easy\nYeah no I I avoided it for years and I'm\nA good friend of mine in Chicago alfonzo pun a chili he kept saying you should learn that on this you should learn this music on the instrument\nAnd I just thought it couldn't be done and then I I heard a assembling player I'm from Holland or a guy by the name of John ... Khan who are played wonderfully and even though it's a different tuning scheme altogether I just thought yeah I Need\nTo figure this case so this is what let's talk about your camera do summer sure Kay uh it it is it is a beautiful sounding instrument but our ... you say you're tuning it differently\nSince yeah there is an American tuning um that's kind of based around um the cycle of if I Want to get into all that but um yeah it's great for folk tunes um and uh\nIt's still you know it's it's playing gypsy swing or really any kind of jazz on the instrument is still pattern based there are actually shapes that I'm following the kind of work like gee cheat but there are a little bit bigger than your typical shapes that you follow it\nAnd for the radio audience I mean the the hammer do summers is sitting in front of you as like almost like a tilted card table right and it's got a\nZillion strings that you don't get into ... fourteen years to tune it [laughter] but\nBut it it is it they are tune to a patterns like you said so you're you're actually aiming with your hammer and you don't miss often yeah I Do you just don't know to see you're playing so fast\nWe can see right that's right exactly well\nLet's get back into the music of Django Reinhardt and you're going to invite the lovely a Andy to come up and she is going to sing vocal on a song that is not necessarily I'm associated with the Django Reinhardt but you're going to the ... going to recognize\nThe tune actually singing it's from his CD swing more to the tune is called ain't misbehave and it is Andy young hammered dulcimer champion on the ... sauce [noise]\nNo not at\nAll times and I\nKnow a lot but um\nYeah and then have them\nOn saving for you [noise]\nI Know\nWhy\nI'm through with it\nAnd then they have\nThey been going\nIn the car\nNo no no\nWe saw\nIn the me I Do not have made\nNo I'm home I buy me\nAnd then they have that\nOn the then my\nCar [noise]\nWait in oh then\nLee me I Do not stay out late [noise]\nKnow I'm home I buy me\nAmen then hey then\nAnd then my\n...

little bit of Spanish most Spanish\nSo so ... you've been with the hot clubs and it's like two thousand nine and ... this is an amazing form of music not necessarily lending itself to Vogel so how do you how do you how do you get to interpret this as a as an artist too that\nYou are brilliant or about to find out how brilliant you are but but lending the human voice to music like this not an easy thing to\nDo well and during that she had to think of myself as as a part of the band you know I'm just not the vocalists to the band and you\nKnow so there isn't guitar and this is really who I Am on the band member so that's how I think that you know\nWell we're about to find out Nepal or a week you [laughter]\nThat you are you did it when you were in Paris\nRight he went on to what you did your soda and you did the busking thing you'll be played on on the streets and that's something that a Django did as well he had in his early years is so so I mean what was that like for you as an artist performing in the streets of Paris kind of a romantic founding yeah I\nI Am kind of a hopeless romantic but what was really funny about it I had a birthday on and I'm a lot of people took my picture and then they would come up to me and say excuse anymore\n... blue photograph she's it okay and I would do my best French impersonation ago [noise] [noise]\nI made so much money can be real thing that

a and the year two thousand where a a French pop art is sort of an hurts and and hurt yet what is the what I mean and ah and brought it back to the public actually well\nIn recent the last Twenty years a lot of his music has been used in motion pictures which is another way of of introducing his his music to the to the public but I don't think his back story is really well known Paul I mean the whole idea of the other being so severely\nHandicapped and us being in yet being almost superhuman on a front board right I mean that that that is as as brilliant a part of his his or as the music itself\nYeah superhuman that's it that's all you need to know that's\nThat's all we're going to talk about [laughter] that's fine so we're going to get back to Isabella here you have a wonderful CD
