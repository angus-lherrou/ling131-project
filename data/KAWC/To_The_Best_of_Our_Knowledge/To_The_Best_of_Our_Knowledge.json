one of its early leaders was Warren feral author of the myth of male power [noise] that look with the cortex the men's rights movement but ... says he never considered the men's movement a backlash\nTo feminism more like a continuation\nThe blessing that the women's movement case two girls and women was basically saying two two girls about let's say there is a a ... you're married and you're both men and women have a a a job\nAnd relatively decent job and the woman because pregnant as a woman has basically to herself I have three options here\nOption was to be full time involved with my children options who should be full time involved with my workplace option three has to do some combination of both the man just sort of sits back and he says oh yeah I have three options to option one has worked fulltime option to his work fulltime and three has worked fulltime\nAnd then if you are is a great deal of money he calls it power but power if you feel obligated to herd muddy federal for somebody else spins while you die sooner I think that's a very deficient definition of power\nAnd there's been no men's movement to help boys question that paradigm\nThat's a very deficient definition of power and there's been no men's movement to help boys question that paradigm\nSo what I Want to bring in the men's rights movement here and and sort of what just as a response to cause you are commonly called the father of the men's rights movement what do you see as the goal here as the value of this movement\nThe men's rights movement and it's sort of current form is like someone who is shouting to be heard for Thirty years and has not been heard\nAnd when people shall to be heard they get hurt they get mean they distort they do anything to get attention and so many people in the men's rights movement are highly intelligent and thoughtful other people in the men's rights movement feel that that women have\nGotten a lot of opportunities that men don't have and that nobody sees the opportunities that men don't have\nAnd we should point out I mean there is a nasty side to all of this or I mean and that's as ... as well as one reporter is called it you know it's an army of massage units in troll ... on the Internet\nYes well first of all it is in an army of but many of the people in the men's movement are so hurt and such pain\nThat they're shouting out and when people don't get heard as in any relationship they start getting meaner and meaner and angrier and angrier and so if we want to do the best we can is instead of saying trolls or army of let's say what are they trying to say that we are hearing\nWhen the women's movement first surfaced I remember and I was on the board of now in New York City as you know\nI remember being on the Barbara Walters show in the today show\nAnd Barbara Walters had well how can you be part of a movement and where you have people like ... who was bisexual this was the number of years ago this was considered not okay and I said Barbara first of all people who are bisexual may see the heterosexual world more clearly than we do\nWhat do we open our ear as to what the women's movement is saying and instead of calling them dikes and bra burners why don't we hear their best intent\nAnd that led me to spending a good part of my life I'm supporting the women's movement and trying to articulate two men who were feeling threatened by it what the woman's move its best intent was\nWe should just reiterate this point because I mean this is kind of fascinating man you who are so identified with the men's rights movement back in the seventies you work for the national organization for women your called the Gloria Steinem of men liberation I think that's going to surprise a lot of people\nAnd really the the myth of male power was really inspired in many respects um by Betty ... second book the second major book called the second stage with what she said\nThat we've we've done a great job with women and now we have to focus on men and if we don't focus on men the second stage of the women's movement we will be in trouble but there's an underlying leap reason that we don't listen to to men\nAnd that is because part of what toxic masculinity is about is men in order to become successful\nHave to learn to repress their feelings that express their feelings\nSo when a man is feeling down and depressed we don't hear about it but he he may act out instead like drinking driving are getting DUIs and so the parents focus on the DUIs and we don't focus on the hurt and the pain that is leading to the to the DUI the questions that are being asked\nAnd we have things for example like you know we have\nI think it's six officers in federal offices of women's health we have no offices of men's health even even though men die sooner if we consider ourselves progressive and liberal we need to see the pain of men as well as women\nAnd boys as well as girls and that's our that's our next

the U.S no writing is easy but it it is\nSo it's easier for you to write about Nigeria when you're here in the U. S.\nNo writing is easy [laughter] but it it is the Fords means certain insight into it knowing it was looking at it from a distance being in Nigeria haven't grown up in Nigeria illuminates my understanding of American even though I'm an American\nI Want to pick up a little bit on your own personal history your your background because it's it's obviously informed or you're writing\nYou were born in in the U. S. right in Michigan if but then quickly your family move within a few months to like us and you grow up there for for how long how many are seen Evan seniors yeah and then came back to America and then I came back to the U.S\nBack to the mid west back to Kalamazoo for university we had no money very little but they came to the U. S. I got some scholarships like some loans\nAnd then I had to start learning what it meant to be here as an American who is in Niger and it was almost as if for the first time I was also learning that I was black did not need to be stated in Nigeria because everybody else around me was black\nI mean the U.S now I had to learn the racial politics of the u._s.\nSo when you first came here it sounds like you did not have the experience of most African Americans I did not and so but then over time you started having those ...\nYou know I've been in the U.S for\nA twenty five years I'm a black guy in America of course [laughter] you know it's inevitable but you know within those first couple of years there are many things I did not have a narrative for\nWhat does it mean if I'm strolling around in a small town in Michigan and a car slows down the window is Juan down and someone shouts the N. word at me I had to figure out what to think about that\nBut also what does it mean even in a social space in a university setting\nAnd somebody says to me oh you're not like those other blacks\nWhat does that mean you know and all of this stuff has to be understood and you know it took time but my experience of life is as a black person in America or you live in Brooklyn I live in Brooklyn I live in the u._s. yeah so and did you consider Brooklyn home I consider Brooklyn home\nBecause that's where my wife is my brother lives there um my friends are there\nMy book so they're so that's how I consider leaders home\nMy parents live there is where I grew up if I go to Niger my room is there it's a place where the two most spoken languages in Lagos you buy an English language is I'm fluent in so there's an at home this\nBut home is also wherever there's Good Wife by [laughter] that sounds [laughter] that connects the needs of the world in a way that is to reduce the ball and as essential to my experience of the world\nDo you consider yourself more Nigerian or more America\nNeither split right down the middle or rather a hundred percent of both\nI feel very invested in Niger is feature as a book I've been working on for a long time about Lagos so I think about Niger a lot\nI'm American and um America's and crisis at the moment I feel invested in\nBeing an American who with other Americans think about what this country ought to be I'm a citizen who is not a patriot but I'm a citizen in the sense of being invested in what do we owe each other what do we do to protect each other's writes\nThose philosophical questions are very interesting to me it might money's being used to kill foreigners in the theater of war vets my business\nThose who suffer go questions are very interesting to me if my money is being used to kill foreigners in the theater war that's my business so I'm very American in that way and I'm also very nature and in that way\nSo you said the two cities that you spent the most time in our like us and New York city yeah are they just two totally different experiences for you or or ... or did they have certain similarities I mean obviously two huge cities the coming out of these are very similar\nUh it is the experience of called ... which is maybe the ... definition of home from me [laughter]\nSo you're you're you're comfortable in cities I'm comfortable among cosmopolitan people who share some of my assumptions about\n... I've been talking about ... if somebody says you know engage should be and or Muslim should be shot I say well no that's not the conversation the conversation is how is somebody who's sexual these different somebody who's religion is different\nHow is that person able to inhabit the same space and have the same rights and respect as anybody else that sort of the core value of cosmopolitan and some right absolutely so what would you say some of the biggest differences between like us and they are in New York is much richer\n... might have twenty five buildings of monumental scale\nAnd New York has three hundred never ceases to surprise me the sheer physical scale of New York and then there's that thing in New York of being a will capital Lagos is the capital of Africa don't lead people in Cairo Johannesburg to tell you different\nYou know it's all live and they had on this is a very strong guy talk yeah America is LA\nWhere the pop culture of Africa is being made and so ... the capital of Africa but New York is the capital of the world so that Neal is almost not an American city it's a city that's a vision of what is it will look like if these borders\nAre not as they are I\nLoved and actually with with a passage from from your book open city\nWhich is set in New York it kind of a novel of New York and where where you are wandering hand which is sort of I think ... some of the things that we've been talking about the jury that yes thank you for that is a book of wandering and what I really wanted to evoke over the course of this book was\nPsychological intensity but all sorts of plenty [noise]\nAt first I encountered the streets of incessant allowed [noise] shock after the days focus and the relative tranquility\nAs someone had shatters the calm\nSilent private chapel with a layer of a TV set [noise]\nI Will move my way through crowds of shoppers\nWorkers\nTo road construction some forms of taxes [noise]\nWalking through busy parts of town meant I laid eyes on more people\nAnd I was a customs we've seen in the course of a day\nEach neighborhood of the city appear to be made up a different substance\nEach seem to have a different era pressure [noise]\nDifferent psychic weight the bright lights shuttered shops housing projects and luxury hotels [noise]\nThe fire escapes in city parks [noise]\nFutile task of sorting went on the phones began to morph into each other\nAnd assume abstract shapes [noise]\nWent on to the phones begets morph into each other\nAnd assume obstruct tree [noise]\nRelated to the real city [noise]\nOnly because my mind finally she'll she'll city still itself [noise]\nHad you cold talking with Steve ... from ... new book is called blind spot and you can see some of the photographs in it on our website at ... dot org where you'll also find a link to a much longer interview Steve did with him in the millions [noise]\nSo we're talking this hour about reinventing yourself getting outside boxes or writers have a word\nFor those boxes genres here's Lauren ... with a dangerous idea\nAnd learned here because the author of broken months to [noise] and my dangerous idea is that we should get rid of genre altogether\nI'm so tired of the very artificial arguments that their literature and there at science fiction and that there is westerns and crime novels and they let these old somehow difference and have different values have done\nAs far as I'm concerned we should be permitted to it you know reading habits we should take any Dan Book we like to bed I Love that book is good in bed\nOr in the boss or on the sofa wherever you like to read you probably shouldn't read with your reader and the boss but you know so the idea that we have stories and we have good stories about stories and we have stories you different elements but to reduce them in into these kind of\nLittle boring pigeon hole where they have to fit sending criteria it's so frustrating and tedious [noise]\nI think we miss out on a lot of really good books and of course the bad side by but it also depends on what your idea on science fiction is it's a very broad church it's the same with crime you might have\nOn totally so I'd be like for\nYou know like that was pretty much I it I have this photo of 'em me when I'm about three and Sammy Davis junior and he's cracking up so\nWas just ... those are my folks and right and

Monica was one of them\nAnd so what did he find it was a submarine bigger and more dangerous than anyone had ever seen any Jacobson has the story [noise]\nBusy you more presumes real that the Republicans are celebrating craft beers from around the region would live music ... and long games will be this Saturday from five to nine PM at those are some fatal it'd be like more information you can reach us at Ninety three or four seven six nine zero\nPrices in the Gaza Strip is clean drinking water grow scarcer for taking time [noise] ... disease by getting guns or\nPeople will stop moving to the fences or they will be moving with stones rockets been losing desperately holding out for clean water\nMight be part of the water crisis next time I'm living on her company or a [noise] Monday evening at seven ... the eighty\nNine FM every family has stories about the uncanny ghost stories premonition weird dreams people have had Steve possums family is swimming and\nI grew up listening to all kinds of ... I mean there are stories of exercises and those of us are coincidences of just truly uncanny things that happen\nI don't know if I Believe in goes but um that's a story of\nThe ghost of William ... Presley [noise]\nThis is your app march mhm\nBut um that's a story of\nThe ghost of William ...\nIs this your app march and she's talking about her father\nMy father died when he was eighty in Nineteen eighty three it's about a father's ghost and how he appeared in the house they grow up in Michigan\n\nWe kept the house for the first year after my father went to assisted living and then we sold it [noise]\nAnd in Nineteen Ninety [noise] no I'm Sorry would have been Nineteen Ninety five\nI took a walk down the street where I grew up and the man who had bought the house or a model that\nAsked me if I wanted to see it and I said yes so he introduced me to his wife and I went into the house and she was telling me about how they expanded it and she said your father's ghost had been here and I looked at her like she was a little [noise]\nWacko\nAnd she said they were remodeling the first part of the house\nAnd the vision or a man or a figure appeared\nAnd she went running out of the house and to her husband and said there's some man in the house and she described what she saw and the neighbor across the street was talking to her husband and he said sounds like Bill Bradley\nSeveral months later her husband was downstairs in the basement doing some electrical work and the same person or whatever vision appeared and she went running down the stairs to say he's back and found out her husband had electrocuted himself [noise]\nAnd she ran upstairs called nine eleven and they came and treated her husband or whatever it was they do [noise]\nSo when I got back to Michigan\nI found a picture of my father and his thirties picture my father in his sixties and I sent those pictures to her\nMy goes to show her father [noise]\nSo I Would say that you're at Marge is actually one of the more skeptical members of your family I Would say that's true yeah I mean I've heard ... stories so yeah I mean there are stories of ... after spirit possession\nOf bizarre coincidence is that your mom was it goes to my mom was a ghost hunter in Milwaukee for a while I I grew up with this stuff the IRS the family straight arrow I've been around a lot of true believers and I am not what it is probably not an accident that I became a journalist and yet this stuff the uncanny the paranormal\nYou read about this stuff all the time why\nThere is some serious questions intellectual questions about what is real without throwing your intellect out the window your rationality out the window\nWhere do you make of that store without just saying oh that's impossible you know there's this there's no way one of those interesting people I talked to\nWas Michael Schober the poster boy of skepticism Yahoo's Michael Sherman he is a scientist an atheist\nA regular columnist for Scientific American here the founding publisher of skeptic magazine and he's the guy you go to if you want to have someone throw cold water on these crazy turn almost stories\nThe strange thing is he has its own story\nWell so my wife is from Michael in Germany she was raised by a single mom and her grandfather and her grandfather others radio this little Phillips transistor radio from Nineteen Seventy seven or so\n[noise]\nThey used to listen to music\nNineteen Seventy seven or so\n[noise]\nThey used to listen to music the meeting her and when he died she kept it and it stopped working you know long ago [noise]\n\nAnyway and when she we met and fell in love and so and she moved to Los Angeles to be with me she shipped her belongings out ahead of time including this radio\nAnd I tried to get a working for her because I knew was meaningful to her and I couldn't put new batteries in and checked the wires and slapped on the table firmly and all the things you're supposed to do to get electronic equipment to work and uh you know I couldn't and and so we gave up and I just tossed in the back of a drawer in the bedroom and I\nDidn't think about it for months and then you know the day of our wedding\nOoh just at a particular\nMoment when she was feeling rather sad\nThat there was nobody there from her family and friends a long way from home and we heard music playing in the back of the house is like ... what's bad you know and I thought well I'm a ... going on or my laptop with high dunes or maybe the next door neighbors play music and it was none of that and then we\nOpen the door beneath the fax machine and then there's the radio this plane is blamed Islam saw perfectly you know perfectly tuned to a station for us particularly for my wife this was a very deeply emotional experience I mean meant something to her cell or somebody like me anyway like the grandfather was there\nWith us and the day of our wedding and make her feel good and it did\n[noise]\nIt played the rest of the day and night we fell asleep listening to music on the radio and they went\nThere the next morning endeavor sense even though I get it to work and and still won't work it's still there [noise]\nTo this Sherman I think that was anything more than just a bizarre coincidence not really but it kind of ... [laughter]\nIt was like whoa man ... column down [laughter] call it's okay [laughter]\nUh yeah a little bit but but that also is insightful to me when I talked to other people that have had these experiences makes me more open to what they're talking about are more sympathetic like yeah I get it I totally understand the yeah I had something similar\nHe didn't have to write about that I mean that's actually one of the things that I think is is great about what he did as this goes against his sort of eighty allergy of skepticism\nWhat does it mean I don't know you know I wrote about this and Scientific American just to say you know weird things happen you\nKnow my friends not ... religious friends with people like Deepak Chopra that think that there's a you know sort of a quantum field that inner connect all of this and it quantum consciousness way\nHe thinks that aside you know okay maybe but you know again why are the effects so weak my wife said numerous experiences and last year and a half or she felt sad or was missing home and the radio didn't come on ...\nBut this was this was your wedding day well it was yeah I mean there was something a little unusual because I mean there is another I mean what some people who study mystical experiences say is that\nThe most profound experiences are often once in a lifetime I mean they're not replicable or there there's heightened emotion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary happens and will never happen again\nThat's possible end and it could be you know that science is limited in the sense that we really really need replicable lab tested or some kind of way of getting at the experience again and those kind of one off events don't fit that\nAnd it couldn't be they are real and we just are limited in how we can study them\n[noise] [noise]\nWell I don't think science can I ask the question of what all the truth about the supernatural the nature of the supernatural is is that it is beyond the natural I think\nUltimately true about the supernatural the nature of the supernatural is is that it is beyond the natural I think science studies for natural okay so this is the Stanford anthropologist Daniel Arman with [noise] so I'm the kind of person that people come up to at cocktail parties\nAnd you know I haven't told anybody does but my goodness I was in the hospital I find myself up in the corner of the room looking down at at my body [noise] people see things that other people don't see or couldn't see the here things that other people couldn't tear they\nSometimes feel their mind leaving their body and within around\nMe these experience happened to people and in fact I think they are pretty common\nSo she has been her career studying religion sort of trying to understand religious belief why do people have these beliefs and when she was a grad student in England she was really interested in the pagan community practitioners of magic and she joined it\nSo as not politicians do you do what the field that you've come to study does no I meant I cast spells I was part of groups of people who were conjuring up power I was I learned to read tarot cards I learned to a little bit about astrology a lot about law\nI guess I don't believe has anything to do with reality\nWow [laughter] to think about that um [noise] you are far from alone I mean because pulse LA does workshops and talks all around the world and a lot of people have that experience and it came to Madison recently and we got a chance to talk\nI'm conscious channel I take dictation from guys that worked for a million actually dictate entire books through me that require no editing so I'm primarily known as a conscious channel and I also work\nAs an ... path which is a psychic ability I have this odd ability to step into other people um the living and begin to resemble them become them without having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human radio think that's the way to look at me and who are you channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that their teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness than we are at a higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere was a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bring in ideas of lineage in history that I mean so that in other words you can distinguish between different gods they have the different personalities elective I work with a collective but yeah there's personality that comes through certainly when I work but I don't really see them\nI mean for me the experiences very physical and very auditory I've seen a couple of them and meditation what are they look like the one that I've seen but I Am I'm able to to distinguish clearly and I only saw him because I was hypnotized and somebody said we like to bring your guides through and\nI was quite surprised when somebody showed up and sat down he was\nYou know quite lovely to look that he was older he were a large hat\nAnd it's sort of went up up up and up and there was some sort of flat up the topic was sort of a little bit like you would imagine I suppose\nA Greek Orthodox priest would wear and he held to a sector which was very odd it was in Boston the lettering was raised and it was higher ... and I didn't know what any of it meant the time and um he had blue eyes very blue eyes and a long beard\nAnd he had a Purple Rose of some kind of when you when you have that image I mean do you do take that literally do you think this is what this guide really I think that's how he presented himself for me to this all sounds kinda crazy yeah hang in Akron imagine maybe when you first started having these experiences that might\nHave felt like too much but I mean did you ever feel like you were going crazy [noise]\nNo not really I didn't start off believing in any of this stuff I was raised an atheist you know and I wasn't I didn't have a great interest in the paranormal certainly the we're not you did not come out of her religion you know and not at all I grew up in the Upper West side of Manhattan and we sort of snicker to people who believed in things that was a convenient\nAgnostics as him I suppose when I was twenty five I was a year out of graduate school at Yale I'd had a list of things that I had achieved in the world but I thought would make me okay and I got the whole list and I wasn't okay that's really what happened and I began\nTo pray or to embark on what I now know was the beginning of a spiritual path\nAnd things begin to happen as a result of that too I started happening well the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice and when I hear a voice it's like a fog comes in and around out all of your other\nVoice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice and when I hear a voice it's like a fog comes in and around out all of your other thoughts and it's not your fault it's the only way that I can explain it\nAnd I had a bit of an experience and the experience may well had been hyperventilating I really I may never know what it was but it was an experience of energy\nMoving through my body and out through the top of my head\nAnd then as a result of that I sort of thing might surround people or maybe not as a result of that but shortly thereafter I sort of seeing this things is flashes started you know going off so when you say see lights around people with that was what do they look like wells firefly it sparks a little blue lights over the top of the head\nSo I ended up studying a form of energy healing as a way to get a context for this\n[laughter] I'm sure a lot of people who are listening to us right now are are deeply skeptical female you might be thinking you know you're making it all up or even if you're not you're delusional you care about that kind of skepticism\nNot in the way that I used to I Can't you know I had a life as an academic for very long time I was at NYU for twenty five year teaching creative writing like writing yeah I play running for very long time\nAnd you know initially I was very concerned about what people thought and I kept a very low profile with this\nBut once the first book came out I had to begin to own it a bit more and that was a challenge to you're not you're not teaching creative writing any no I'm not ... I'm traveling around the world [noise]\nSitting in a chair closing my eyes and waiting for this transmission to come through in speaking what I'm hearing them and then all of this energy comes in and fills the room and people who come are having an experience with it [noise]\nYou know I'm not a spiritual teacher I'm not a good ... I'm not a psychic who's gonna connect you with their dead relatives and I don't like doing productive work\nBut if you're actually having problems in your relationship and you give me your spouse's name I can step into your spouse to begin to look like her and possibly hear what's going on in the dynamic and that's been proven out in the film when I'm channeling I'm really just operating as a radio\nSo I'm just sitting in the chair and letting the dial turn to the station that wants to come through and then being receptive to take the dictation\nThat he'll he'll play that out from ... plane that farm if you can when you say you're like a radio and you know you got to sort of tune into the range handle and then the guides we'll we'll speak through you see how does that work I mean ... where are you in that we're whereas pulse sell like ... heated\nI'm president but I'm receded a you sort of in an altered state of conscious I think I'm going to like trance it's light enough that I can interrupt and ... and and and say hey wait a minute this doesn't make any sense which I've been known to do and the rule with all of the books is that they could they can't be edited so all of the books or the on edited transcripts of the sessions\nLike they really are you are and you're not going to do you know sort of cleaning up the language and here's the thing these books either they're not written by you it's like reading your automatic writing any no no no they're spoken these are oral teachings that are transcribed\nDo you think about the metaphysics of all of this okay what's the architecture of this universe that you are describing here\nI Do and I don't I think I only do when I'm sitting with somebody who asks those questions ... while you're sitting with one right now I'm not going to access it myself because I actually don't know\nAnd I would have to recede and begin channeling on your show and I think it was already the way we started off as Congress Asia so far out to begin with ... through\nYou know honestly when I first started doing this stuff I didn't want to record it\nI wasn't looking to be known for it that's for sure I was really hiding out I did a group in my apartment had met for Eighteen years\nI didn't want to record it I wasn't looking to be known for it that's for sure I was really hiding out I did a group in my part but the met for Eighteen years with about ten people who would show up at the most every week and we would sit in a circle and the guys would talk and they would bring this energy through and we would all feel it\nWhat are the guides say oh you were you've written you know multiple books now are they have through view they are that is they're sort of a common message\nYeah I think that who we truly are is not what we think we are in Middle East and and I really talk about humanity being at a\nAt a transitional point that's evolution right now and the the opportunity really is here for us to reclaim what would they would say is I think are true identity and how you identify yourself and your life\nIs primarily based on a lot of collective agreements what it means to be a man whatsoever culture you were brought up in what it means to be a success what beauty is all of these things will be collectively ascribed\nGreat value to is really inherited information and it's actually in most cases operating at a cost\nThis is what they've said they've said that humanity is a time of reckoning in a reckoning is facing of oneself and all of the ones creations and what's been created in fear needs to be recreated in the higher way\nHas anything changed in your own life as a result of all this I mean obviously you what you're doing day to day you know the workshops that you give the toxic if that's different you're not the university teacher anymore but in terms of I don't know how you think what your values are\nI think it's all different it's all different I'm a lot less afraid when I was and I have to say that I was very frightened person ... much of my life afraid of what life ... life yeah life\nYou know I was a sensitive kid you know when I grow up wary consequently and I suppose in some ways maybe I still am you know there's a quote from\nHelen shook them and the woman who was the channel for coursing miracles [noise] she said I don't believe it but I Know it's true\nAnd I can get behind that I understand that I don't believe it either but I Know it's true what do you mean you don't believe that you must believe it I don't I don't I Know that it's happening I don't know how it's happening I don't know how I Do what I Do\nI'm I'm very happy to be able to be part of this but I'm Still challenged by the whole experience\nThat's Paul Salopek he's published

W. Baird dot com has more information and the corporation for public broadcasting\nIs to the best of our knowledge I'm answering champs what is it like to care about someone bad someone evil\nYou know I almost remember that day like it was yesterday it replays in my mind a lot\n[noise]\n[noise] okay [noise]\nI was a [noise] a ship that night [noise] we got the call over the radio it was time to wake them up\nRight now I don't know I Know\nSo I stood there and watched him get ready and fixes hair but it's a plus watch on drugs to the nines especially because it [noise] and we all knew that it was coming close [noise] you ... before he walked into the\nU.S House and uh [noise] if you\nTurn around and say goodbye so that we were all his friends [noise]\nWell\nNo\nThat's the sound of the execution of Saddam Hussein\nHe was hanged in two thousand six following his trial in Baghdad\nAn Adam Rogers some was an American soldier\nOne of the super twelve assigned a guard Saddam Hussein during this trial\nAnd these were young men many just out of basic training spent months alone in close quarters\nWith a man the rest of the world reviled as the butcher of Baghdad\nAs you can hear Adam is still haunted by what happened to\nWield garden a leper was also serving in Iraq at the time it was an airborne ranger and he remembers wondering what such young inexperienced soldiers were doing\nGuarding such a high value prisoner and what effect that might have on Charles Monroe came talked with Adam and was will just come out with a book about the super twelve it's called the prisoner and the power\n\nYou know when they went over there I think they were expecting to kind of do what soldiers expect to do which is get into combat situations and potentially engage with them and kill bad guys and that's why a lot of these guys joined to begin with\nSheila these guys were hooked up during nine eleven right\nYeah exactly that a lot of them joined us out of a sense of patriotism\nTo begin with sure a lot of these guys were hooked up during nine eleven right\nYeah exactly that a lot of them joined us out of a sense of patriotism and\nAnd yeah so I think when they got this assignment they had a mixed response on the one hand um you know I think they were intrigued by the idea that they would be with Saddam Hussein but I think some of them were kinda bummed out that they weren't going to be outside the wire sort of mixing it up with the insurgents and that they'd be kind of stuck in in one place\nThat was a little surprised that these guys didn't have special training after some bunch of high level CIA guy should be guarding Saddam Hussein but some kids the kids from like you know higher that seems strange to me yeah no\nCountry well enough to know that no amount of sophisticated legal argument would save him and so what he did was I think he viewed the trial as an uh an opportunity\nTo kind of rehabilitate his image in the eyes of of his followers and I think as he was an extreme narcissistic and\nWhen he got pulled out of that rabbit hole looking you know like a bomb I think that did a tremendous amount of damage to his when he saw as as his prestige and so from that moment on he resolved to present himself\nTo his people as this defiant leader a strong leader and so that's really what do you use to try\nOn he resolved to present himself to his people as this defiant\nLeader a strong leader and so that's really what do you use the trial to do was to project that image you know during the trial she accused some of the guards of torture\nIt yeah it while they were there how did the guard she would be starting relationship with this man how did they react to this feeble old men they were taking care of now this defiant angry man accusing them of things that weren't true yeah I mean there's a an account from one of the guards\nThat he was on the same day he was in\nCourt wave in about how he had been mistreated by the Americans he got into the elevator to bring him back down into the subterranean cell where they were holding him and he laughed and he said hey don't worry about that that was basically just for the cameras and how you treat me either me great [noise]\nThe trial and we all know with an execution hanging could you tell me about that day what happened at the execution\nYou know I almost remember that day like it was yesterday replays of my mind a lot [noise]\nI was a ship that night and we all knew that it was coming close\nYou know we broke his radio so he can uh here and uh [noise]\nWe got the call over the radio was time to wake them up and\nWe did in the new [noise]\nSo I stood there and watch them get ready and [noise]\nThose hair put his suit on his watch um [noise] he got dress to the nines as best as he could [noise] once that was done I left him and then we all had the mentally prepare for what was about to go down\nAnd that was that was pretty intense because you figure\nIf someone is going to come get him or he was planning to escape he's going to do it now [noise] so that was that was a very intense time just cleaning their weapons and make sure everything was a point with her so [noise] yeah once we got there [noise]\nHe said goodbye to us so [noise] I mean\nWhen when I'm ... I'm Sorry what ... what did he say to you you personally how did you say goodbye to you\nIt was a very it was a very sad once the commotion was over and we knew we were in somewhat of a safe zone knowing what's going to come and get him and\nHe sort of needed to before he walked into the [noise] the deaths house and uh [noise]\nHe turned around and say goodbye [noise] and it said that we were all his friends [noise]\nSome of us were crying and he was sad [noise]\nBut just for that split second to see him in the ... state [noise] it was a it was crazy we've been in firefights we've been through IDs [noise] but at that and nothing to prepare you for that type of situation [noise]\nHappened after the hang immediately after\nThey work so hard to comport themselves in a professional dignified manner to treat him the way they were supposed to and then that kind of all went to hell and uh I mean execution itself\nKind of just resembled a disorganized sort of mob scene and then in the moments after the execution went Saddam's body was getting mistreated you know they were forced to essentially stand there and watch\nI think that I was a [noise]\nDidn't you know they were forced

which is reading the mental state so other individuals\nBut there's actually quite a big gap between that and being nicer to people\nThese same psychologists have a figure it out the bullies for

Hemings chat for some\nOf the snow here to see him [noise]\nI think the family marker you're looking for\nIf you don't know who that is he was the son of our third Saturday [noise]\nLike a lot of our founding fathers Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and was one of them her name was Sally Hemings he had children\nSo how did one of them wind up in Wisconsin graveyard that story is like a giant metaphor for America's tangled racial [noise] it's\nIt makes everything was the youngest son as Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson he came to Madison well it would have been right after the passing in the fugitive slave act so we should go back a little bit in time after time is Jefferson died he created all of his children their freedom\nAs with Sally Hemings freedom\nThey grow up slaves\nOn on Mount a cello on Jefferson's plantation and then once they're fried some of them are done as far as African American authors ... because they had lighten up skills\nThey were all fairly fair skinned and they could pass even Julia ... wife with also multi racial and so she could also pass as white they were in the sense is an Eighteen fifty in Ohio identified as the lotto but then after the fugitive slave act passed in Eighteen fifty\nAshton and Julie I decided to take their three kids and moved further north away from the border and they moved to Madison, Wisconsin and here they pass those white and they identified as white they lived among white society nobody ever questioned that and that is how they continued their life [noise]\nAnd said really who were essence two sons both served in the civil war they served in Wisconsin regiments at the time of the civil war if you were African American and identify that way you had to be in a colored regiment both of them served in white regiment so clearly there is no question that they were white and that they identified that way\nAfter the war John the older when he moved to Memphis and became a cotton shipper was very successful at it but never married\nSome theories that he chose not to because if he had a child who was dark skin that would sort of blow his cover I guess in a manner of speaking and then he could lose everything\nThat really did marry he had sons of his own he said in Madison he ran a very successful large carriage company here and purchased the first on the bus in Madison actually\nSo the children up a former slave became these prosperous been Raymond in Madison, Wisconsin\nYeah they did and I have no idea why they chose Madison one would assume maybe had something to do with the name [laughter] but you know it was also obviously further north certainly safer from the fugitive slave act\nFirst heard the one of the children of Thomas Jefferson\nAnd Sally Hemings was buried half a mile from where I live I was done I mean this is a long way from on a trailer Virginia where I grew up\nI was surprised too and actually I didn't know it until I was on our cemetery to her and one of my co workers pointed this out and I said I'm Sorry who [laughter]\nThey're all over the mid west there so family members and Michigan still time in Ohio now this kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states just speaking about the history of\nAnd Michigan still time in Ohio now this kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states just thinking\nAbout the history of this I mean so you have the son of Jefferson the guy who wrote the declaration of independence and then you have a child who grew up in slavery it's like these threats of American history come together right here in the cemetery\nRight it's interesting how little it sort of know about your local history and how it all kind of intersect in various ways and it still affects us today everything is so famous right and he stands for so many things [noise] and on and can't avoid kind of feeling the weight of that here\nMm\nAaron Hogan is an education specialist with the Wisconsin veterans museum here in Madison\nOh\nSo by now pretty much everyone knows that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his life\nSally Hemings and that they had children what Twenty years ago the Jefferson Hemings relationship was mostly a rumor that his white descendants denied and then a brilliant legal scholar Annette Gordon Reed proved it with historical records stories passed down by Sally Hemings children\nYes Madison Hemings says that they were happy growing up\nBecause they knew they were not going to be slaves all their lives would eventually happen to the children the children who did survive into adulthood of Sally ... well Beverly Beverly is a male and his sister Harriet those are the two older children\nThey left Monticello to live as white people they don't have freedom papers and you can see why they don't want them because\nIf they had free papers people would know that they were part black because they've been in slave and you'd be able to trace them one reason we don't know about their descendants is because they have no paper trail ... we know about Madison it asked and and that's the thing about documents that's the importance of them once you put things down and writing\nYou can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is what do we make of Thomas Jefferson the revered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence saying that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality\nWho's not just a slave owner but mhm have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children to read and what\nWould we do well that kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem with Jefferson is the connection to slavery\nAnd we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about making people work for no money or whipping people or whatever it was an institution that ended up with mixed bloodlines and a lot of different ways to rape\nThrough connections that we don't understand and that make us uncomfortable I think the thing to make of it is a Jefferson was a person\nWe should take him down from the mountain as this revered icon no there are things to admire about Jefferson and we're just going to have to grapple with the fact that a person who wrote the declaration of independence and helped create the country\nNot just Jefferson both Washington and all of them the number of them were slave holders they help people in bondage\nAnd profited from that I think you'd have to take the bitter with the sweet and I don't know that it's ever good to revere people\nAs God in a way because they're always going to disappoint you\nI think a better way to look at it is to say this is what these human beings did on their time interest than some of it was good and some of the bat and what can we live with and what things do we reject how do we move on from that Jefferson didn't think that we were going to stay in one place\nBut he had already fallen mystic view of race relations didn't eat I mean he was he was right says to me and he thought black people were inferior we're not as smart\nAs when you found that most people at that time thought and that's a lot of people think today there's no question about that even though he says I ventured as a suspicion only but not a suspicion he believed that whites were better than blacks that was the currency of the time\nI Do think he thought slavery was wrong but it's like many other things that we believe that we don't live by\nThis was not what really animated Jefferson I mean we're interested in slavery and race and we should be but that's not the main thing he was interested in he was interested in the United states of America he'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society that's what he was six eight and all that slavery\nStates of America he'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society\nThat's what he was fixated on that slavery thing that'll solve itself but it's like many things in life usually if I could just fix this that little thing over there it'll be fine but it's that little thing over there that destroyed the thing that you love yeah and slavery was he came to see the walk upon which\nThe union will be split and that was true yeah\nThank you very much this is just fascinating history Oh

every semester\nWhite African and European\nWestchester University in Pennsylvania Anita ... leads the DNA discussion project every semester students in her class take a genetic ancestry test and she says the results can change the stories they tell about themselves and others often in profound ways\nI started twelve years ago when somebody said I think I read an article that said you could trace somebody's ancestry based on their DNA and I thought boy I bet that there are a lot of people walking around thinking their backgrounds are one thing and there are different and how would that change the conversation that we had about race\nPicture this you have a class full of undergraduate kids and they all spit in a test tube and send it away and is there a big unveiling day when I get their results [laughter] yes\nAnd almost invariably there's something there that is unexpected and people are funny it really runs the gamut somebody will say the test is not right you know tested over but they also start to see that they're connected to people that they did not think they were connected to\nAnd it's it's really neat in one setting there was a young white guy who had two or three percent Africans background he would sit next to two African American gentleman and they wanted a high five and any time sort of reflecting in my life I've been here is this appropriate [laughter] have you gone through your own genetic testing\nI have it took me ten years to do it and I said what would Freud say and indeed found some things I expected and the things that I didn't expect like what I was surprised how much of European I'm African American I was surprised how much European was in my background\nTwenty five percent European which floored me the most stunning experience that I had\nWas that I went to Guyana several years before I took the test and as part of that trip we went to a place called the door of no return which is where the slaves went out\nOn the ships and just never returned\nAnd so when I looked at my profile I'd significant Guyana and my background and I thought oh my goodness one of my relatives\nLiterally probably went through that door and I was surprised that my own reaction and I've heard other people say that they have been surprised at their own reaction surprised how\nJust how emotional that was for me and I think that that is something that a lot of African Americans experience it's hard to articulated it sort of a low level anxiety\nJust this tremendous feeling of sadness as a person who has a background in slavery where you were systematically told that you are just not fully human too to face that directly by looking at my DNA was very potent for me\nBroadcasting from the Robert Hardy radio studio complex on the campus of

me that mystery and secrets or two of the major themes in both the twin peaks TV series and enter novel what do you think\nI Would agree with that I Would say that the idea of mystery is something that is\nProfoundly inherent in all of reality it's a Joseph cambell mystery as opposed to a murder mystery I it's it's a sense\nThat there's something going on just beneath the surface of what we can perceive it it's really what people talk about I guess when they're talking about a a spiritual sense of reality that there's something ... and\nPerceive it it's really what people talk about I guess when they're talking about a a spiritual sense of reality that there's something of an accent and\nHard to grasp on and very often seems just beyond our reach but there are times in our lives when we catch glimpses of it now\nAnd UFOs identified flying objects also come up on more than one occasion and why did one on to include so much UFO content [noise]\nNumber one we had dealt with it in a in a very particular and specific way and the second season of the show was that was ground for it\nNumber two it becomes a kind of a stand in for this idea of the mysterious experience and as I delved pretty deep into UFO history\nYou quickly realize this is a phenomena that goes back not just hundreds but literally thousands of years\nThere's this very strange tradition and inhuman storytelling of people being confronted or or abducted or meeting beings that they have no explanation for understanding I cite\nAn example from the Bible and ... and the the Old Testament sees this flaming cherry it in the sky and talks of meeting these giants the L O game it's a whole book of the Bible well that's pretty weird that are very well yeah and then I'd I uncovered in in the nineteenth century there were these\nHuge string of accounts of people all over the west in the mid west\nSeeing what they describe this giant airships floating across the sky and says well before the the Wright brothers had ever been up there but these these stories are legion and not all of them have been debunked it it's a mysterious and persistent\nPart of human existence and it's not just in our culture it it appears to be fairly universal\nYou mentioned that what we call the UFO experience it raises the question in my mind should we have a different name for it like what would you called it safe you know going further back and pre the Wright brothers and things that you should we come up with some sort of name to describe this kind of experience\nI mean in the in the nineteenth century and in England they called it the spirit world they called it encounters with the fairies or ALS or in Germany they were ... or trolls are again worms that lived in the mountains even when we were up in a Washington filming we were out in some native people land and\nMichael Horse who's a member of the cast and a Native American himself took me aside and said that the native people had told them one of the forest where we were shooting\nWas where the little people showed up so this ideas persistent we Americans have a tendency to think we know everything because we have a lot of knowledge yeah but there's different kinds of knowledge\nYou also leave conspiracy theories in into the secret history of Twin Peaks very artfully and these conspiracy theories really add to the narrative drive of your story why do you think we're so drawn to conspiracy theories\nI've thought about this a lot because you know I was a\nI was ten years old when JFK was shot he was buried on my tenth birthday and for four years I was obsessed\nWith getting to the bottom of this and there's a whole worldwide industry on who kill JFK that became a kind of alternate way of looking at the world and that was the first time when I was ever really particularly aware\nThat we didn't just have to depend on\nConventional or authoritative voices that they were perhaps other ways of of viewing it\nI think a lot of conspiracy theories arise out of the the notion that something as momentous as say the murder of a young and vigorous and shining example of American political history could be taken out\nSo the murder of a young and vigorous and shining example of American political history could be taken out by somebody is small and is insignificant in as\nStupid as a as Lee Harvey Oswald so that gave rise to this idea but it it can't have been him yeah had to have been something more momentous it had to have been something that that ran much deeper\nThat it can't be random there's gotta be some underlying meaning it's a it's kind of a just a sort of the way our minds are wired right to detect these patterns in and make sense of the\nWorld exactly once that gets started once the ball gets rolling it's pretty hard to stop\nYeah definitely final question what do you think he's the legacy of Twin Peaks the television series [noise]\nBoy it's a hard one for me to answer because other than that it touched\nIn some way on some kind of truth that spoke to a lot of people if you if you work creatively for a living sure you want to entertain people and you want to you want to make them laugh you want to pick him cry and you want to you want to tell them a story that keeps them on the edge of their seat but\nTo go back to the Joseph cambell idea of the function\nOf a storyteller and a culture is that it's our job to keep mythology alive for people\nThat it's akin to what ... did and and first world cultures they kept alive the mysteries of the past and that somehow in live in the president and I I like

mean we're in one right now we're in the transitional stay between birth and death and so the bard over the book sort of is the one that goes from the inside of your desk to the incident of your your

willing to kind of face the music particularly the music of their own ... you know the thing that they brought forward from life\nThat's not allowing them to go onto the next step\nSo the danger of

some dark and various [noise]\nAny story is a mystery writer she's the author of the best selling cops history series she is also a serious Gardner with sidekick\nWriting about we can\nIntroduce Shannon Henry fiber to him\nAll Abraham Lincoln's mother was killed by a plant she was killed in a very indirect way and the plant is white snake rude poisonous\nWould grades on this plant the poison would make them sick but\nAlso get into their milk and people would drink the milk and get sick and die and that was called milk sickness and it was a real problem throughout the Eighteen hundreds in fact the mystery part of it is interesting it took us a long time to really understand how plant poisons work in part because how do you even do those experiments\nThe KGB starts assassinating people with rice and which is an extract of the castor bean seed\nAnd we did not in medical science even know how much rights and it took to kill a person so as late as the Nineteen seventies we're doing experiments where we're figuring out what would be the lethal dose for a pig that weighs roughly the equivalent of a human it's amazing how much we still don't know about toxins and\nPlants I read that you have a poisonous plant garden and that it's been lifted as one of them I think Eighteen most unusual gardens and the world\n[laughter] well what about that I wanted to grow these plants it's weird to write a book about plants that you've never grown and maybe never even seen and some of them are pretty hard to get\nYou can't just walk into a garden center and say I would like twelve manager aches they're just not for sale but as I'm doing these interviews and reaching out to people in the horticulture community\nPlant start getting offered to me\nKind of secretly like you actually yes I I really did go visit a farm that grew a lot of very poisonous and strange plans including some illegal plants\nThere was up in the hills and before I went up there where I knew there was going to be no cell phone coverage I remember calling my husband going if I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter] what plants\nSo like I ... maybe you've heard of a host\nIf I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter] what plans [laughter]\nSo like I watched maybe you've heard of a loose new genetic plant from South America\nThings that maybe are not quite illegal but that the da is very aware of and that are hallucinogenic plants but they were going straight up you know it was a pop farm and it was a I mean they were going other illegal\nStraight up illegal plants as well so you're he started collecting collecting so I started collecting them but they need to go somewhere so I planted a poison garden\nAnd I really made it a I had fun making a creepy so like rather than plant markers I had the cement tombstones that identified what\nThe plant does to you madness or blindness I found a company that makes resident skeletons for medical schools and they'd sell their factory\nSeconds on line [laughter] I had all these lightly divide the skulls and hands and and so I had zones are kind of like a skeleton buried those creepy and wonderful but not terribly practical was it beautiful I mean opium poppies are beautiful right yeah I mean a lot of these are\nVery pretty plant so I was crying Fox glove ... which is a heart medication it's a great example if a plant that's both medicine and poisoned depending on the dos and who's taking it\nAnd tobacco's beautiful at flowers and its spending on which when you grow can be quite large and impressive looking plan so yeah a lot of them\nAre very pretty I've heard that some people think plants have a consciousness I was reading something about maybe the night shades have inability to hate\n[laughter] I think that's true well I was needed by this and that is something that we're finding\nOut more about the one way the plants communicate is through route exits so they exude chemicals out of the roots into the soil and those route exits can attract\nCertain microbes are other living creatures that might help the plant do better or ward off enemies\nAnd they're also plans to do the same thing above ground that if they're under attack they can release a pheromone\nThat would attract the predator of the bug that's attacking them so in other words they can signal for help mhm so that's certainly suggest that they're able to react to stimuli around them in a way that we didn't know was possible and we're sort of just starting to figure out\nDo you think that there's a reason that we have these toxic plants in our world\nOh sure they're just defending themselves and this is something I Try to remind people of is that you don't have to be terrified of poisonous plants\nThey're just trying to make a living you know they're they're trying to protect against predators it's a mistake to think that because some things green and comes out of the ground that it's all natural and it's therefore good for us you know we tend to think that anything that's plant based it's\nMore healthy and superior in some way but strychnine is a hundred percent plant based on what a cyanide so as rights and they're just trying to keep from getting eaten plants are rooted in the\nGround they don't have opposable thumbs they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why I plan to have\nForeign or spines are stinging medals I mean they're all just trying to keep predators away [noise]\nSo they inflict pain and suffering on anyone who tries to

astonishing you watch the comedy that anyone would be that inhumane\nThere's one I remember there's I think you wrote that at one point they tested a lot of the girls for their radium levels they didn't give the girls the test results but they themselves created a list of who's going to die first yeah\nIs exactly what happened they graded then depending on how radioactive Iowa and so I saw in

understand we were free to experience a physical connection that we don't always long for and the real world but had never been able to achieve what do you think oh it's an interesting call yeah\nI mean that's the lure right of the Internet in some ways that's the sweet part I guess you could say of what the Internet allows us write the beneficial sides is that we we long for connection yeah we long not to be lonely we long to know that we're not\nCrazy or that there are other people like us out there or that we're love done these kind of very human emotions and the Internet\nPromises promised promises that still promises that we will\nWe will connect with other people and and it does obviously at that started people fall in love online and they need long lost friends and they come

that we're also toward it on line and so\nI mentioned online dating for example where somebody can fall in love but on the flip side it also teaches you to like white people into the trash that you

have to deal with each other\nAnd this option cannot just ignore each other\nBut to really find an active social place in the world that doesn't include each other I think that is genuinely new\n\nReally need to think about when we need to deliberate\n\nWe really need to think about when we need to deliberate when we need to\nJust be with each other I think the question is not turning off our technology and not getting underway wonderful technology but it needs to be putting its place and sometimes you really just need to be with each other and give each other are full attention\nAnd that's the sense that I fear\nThat we're losing and we need to we focus on\n\nAn IT social scientist Sherry Turkle she's the author of Alone Together why we expect more from technology and less from each\nOther Mm coming up media there is Doug ... says technology is changing the way we think\nAs strange as to the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio and NPR acts I'm Johnny Cash [noise]\n\nThis week on American roots we look back it's a man in his life and music as freeze your country Gruber door rockabilly rebel Johnny Cash remembered by his family and friends I'm mixed with American root for the Iraqi\n[noise]\nStay with us for American roots beginning at noon here on KBA WC empty WC dot org\nGee do you see is supported by visit him a present in Rio de surveys Abreu fast October twenty somethings from five to nine at desert sun stadium a limited number of VIP tickets are available that include early injury to VIP area a souvenir mugs an opportunity to meet him sees big dean Baba and more information and tickets available at Rio de surveys the dot\nCom I don't know about you but I feel like I can never ever no matter what I Do keep up with the endless tolerant of email and Facebook\nNot to mention Twitter Instagram Snapchat and all the rest will media theorists Doug Rushkoff says all this technology is actually changing our relationship to time and we're all having trouble adapting to what he talked with Steve ...\nDug the title of your book present shock is a reference to Alvin talks or Nineteen Seventy book future shock what's the difference between future shock and present shock\nWell I guess in some sense maybe the the sensation might be similar to the real difference is that the future that out and talk to her was describing that we were moving towards is here with us now so well Tom Sawyer was really warning us\nReally to learn how to orient to a world\nThat was changing ever more rapidly to basically be able\nTo adjust to change it self I'm arguing that that changes happen that if anything you know as we pass from the nineties into the twenty first century we became less of a society that was just obsessed with the future and what's next in what's happening what's the next big thing we're all going\nAnd we became was decided it was very much in the moment in a kind of a a an always on real time hyper connected moment so our our focus really becomes less about\nHow do we adjust to change to something much more like how do we adjust to living in a world where everything is happening seemingly at the same time\n... where you break this idea of prison to them down into five big areas and let let's talk about that was one you call did you ... what does this which\nIs interesting and it kind of come out of that video games\nAreas and let let's talk about that was one you call did you ... what does this\nWhich is interesting and it kind of come out of that video game sensibility I mean the beauty of video games is that instead of watching some other character go through a story\nYou are the one going to the store you know you're the one making the choices in real time and you move from choice to choice to choice Detroit's rather than watching these canned choices in the sense of agency\nBut you know the digital environment\nVery often makes it seem like you don't even have to choose you don't have to choose between this and that you can choose both and we're doing so many things on line where we are choosing both that we've ended up with really multiple instances multiple incarnations of our stuff\nKind of running simultaneously and all these different platforms and it's very hard to live with more than one you know digital technology is great for copying things but\nHuman beings don't copy so well so there's you on Twitter that maybe somebody's commenting on something that you did there's you and your inbox it's filling up with messages that are waiting for responses their view on Facebook who\nMight be being used to advertise a product you never even heard of while you were asleep you know and you'll wake up that you've been in these sponsored stories you know so\nHow do you deal with all the different use running simultaneously that's sort of the essence of the digital ... are just kind of digital confusion\nSo you're basically you're saying that it's enough to make you a little crazy there's almost like a split personality here 'cause we're tending to so many different digital persona\nRight and even if your personality is not split your digital personalities are split and you're a single person now it's going to have to deal with all of them I got the idea for the ... chapter when I was\nIn the lobby of a hotel in Berlin I kept trying to log into my Google Calendar to see if I can do one talk at the same time as another talk with her I'd be able to get from one to the other in time\nAnd each place I went I couldn't log until I finally got wife I end up in this lobby\nAnd I get this message back from Google that they locked me out of my calendar because they said I was trying to log in from too many places at once [laughter] right so Google Calendar didn't believe I was a human being\nThey didn't believe one human could be and all those places at once and that to me seemed to be the essence of you know the problem we have a digital culture it's not this idea of information overload and all these people have all these problems with digital technology and this I promise you present shock is not one of these books that just whining and handwringing about\nThe problems of talented but what I Do get concerned about\nIs our readiness to really to put our human lives into digital time frames and digital technologies really don't understand time they live outside time they're just sequences you know your Twitter feed is not in real time it's just trying to catch up with you\nJust because people are sending emails out to you it doesn't mean that now you have to respond in real time to them right the beauty of digital technology was that it waited\nYou know the early conversations we used to have on the bulletin boards we were also smart because we had all the time in the world to respond to these things we sounded smarter online than we did in real life\nRight well in the irony of course is that this was supposed to make our life better it was supposed to make it easier and it seems like it just makes it feel crazier\nAnd that's because I mean and not to get leftist on you or anything but I I really do believe it's because instead of using digital technology kind of fresh slack which is what we saw it as right we're all going to be able to work from home in our underwear anytime we want you know because we're just\nTechnology and our first black which is what we saw it as right we're all going to be able to work from home and our underwear anytime we want", "year": "2018", "show_name": "To The Best
