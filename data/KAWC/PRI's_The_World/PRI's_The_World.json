S. and in a a big part of it it has to do with the Supreme Court upholding this North Dakota ... voter id law what does that law say it basically\nSays that ah unless you have a a street address on your id in North Dakota you aren't a lot about\nMost of the people who live on reservations don't actually have a a a physical street address they use pill boxes\nSo now that the Supreme Court has upheld that law what can people on reservations in North Dakota do uh coming up on midterms but\nYou know they can they can give them a general treated your street address 'em through the uh the native council through the tribal council in each reservation\nI I'm just curious if you're an actor and I I just wondered you call on different strengths their talents or in your activism than than

campaign an effort to get the vote out among Native Americans in North Dakota thank you so much mark thank you so happy to talk to you [noise]\nThese this week is that China and Russia has been routinely eavesdropping on President Trump's phone conversations what are the parallels with what happened to uncover Merkel\nThere certainly are some parallels I mean what sort of different about the reporting is that's a ... it was almost like how could are good friends and allies be doing this to us if you talk to people\nOff the record you know not on camera they would say yeah we all know that this sort of stuff goes on all the time we know that all major countries eavesdropping spy on one another but they shouldn't be doing in such open and crass ways\nThat seems to have gotten a bit last year you know it's sort of being more reported on as you well you know this is just another son that Trump doesn't do what he's doing\nThat he's reckless that he's endangering the security of everybody it hasn't generated nearly as much heat as say the letter bomb soil which is\nThe reaction that Christopher described in Greece is exactly the same reaction that's happened here without saying that Trump has brought this on himself he's ratcheted up the tension um that's generating a lot more passionate a lot more heat than the thought that somewhat it's a hack Donald Trump's iPhone\n[noise] now I Can't have a journalist from Germany and eternal is from Greece in an interview without asking you both you know your two countries have had some tensions in recent years you know over ... and that kind of thing I mean how how your country is getting along these days [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I I think it's\nA love affair slowly slowly let's start from our prime minister miss the shippers who um\nWas elected in two thousand the steam with tens of thousands of people gathering in the center of options on the repeating off him his very famous trying ...\nGo home he hate to\nAn end at the beginning this kind of the nation are between ... and\nShe was a was always at the core of our attention as journalists how easy possibly going to confront too when you first meet in the European Union I'm\nGradually we we learned that are quite special relationship between them and it was not of course a lot of the ... by any\nMeans but it was certainly a kind of a mother towards the child or she seemed\nTo kind of educate them in the way it listen let's talk peacefully come here come to the stream ... by ourselves sometimes alleged tool it we know now that he respects the very very much the situation of the relationship\nBetween the two countries I think is um it's quite good\nJefferson how does it feel in Berlin\nI I Would pretty much agree with that I mean I think I'm Greece's lot smaller than Germany so it doesn't commands or attention here probably as much as we command their attention there but I think this sense is that you know the Greeks has done a pretty good job of trying to get their\nEconomic problems under control they basically done what the Germans have asked to them and that they should be given a break and of course\nYou know I'm a little medical has much bigger problems with some other European leaders you know I mean compared to like victim all bond in Hungary you know I'm a going out for a meal which puts the prime minister of Greece is probably a walk in the park\nAll bond and hungry you know I'm a going out for a meal with the prime minister reaches probably walk in the book\nYou've already just another part I'm sure the largest and most of our brothers well we we lost from Jim in my my favorite cookbook doom or just lost one by immunity you days ago\nAnd I'm really really good for both [laughter] I Believe that oh\nYou don't you move your use of course a hundred million so that gives me\n[laughter] journalists Christos ... is in Athens Jefferson chases with ... in Berlin I Want to thank you both for being with us today engine up at two o\n\nOur next story is about a part of immigrant life in the U.

because of health deteriorated so much from the mental anguish of being separated from her grandson with special needs and she presented in court and still they prolonged her attention finally actually it was only when a congressperson peso O'Rourke got involved that she was released in the it'll took to reunite with her grandson\nWhere our Maria and her grandson today there in Connecticut

so what do you think it is about that period that some people in Brazil are nostalgic for that seems to be resonating when ... talks about it\nWell I think the main issue is that Brazil never reckon with its military dictatorship past and the military controlled the process of transition from dictatorship to democracy\nIn Nineteen Seventy nine they passed it abroad\nAmnesty law that prevented anyone involved in human rights violations working for the regime to be prosecuted for eternity so unlike Argentina or Chile Brazil never prosecuted to military bowl and the dictatorship the military involved in the extrajudicial killings and the torture\nSo Brazilians have developed this idea that there was a time without crime without economic problems and I think that both scenario is trying to

Thanksgiving sometimes that just happens to\nThe question now I think that we're going to have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well\nHas Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a chance we're going to see how you guys and that my main that the cycle blue why this coming might just be more of a trickle\nHow much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier terrorists and trade how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region\nWell it depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from rice as an issue and people of color they were very very distressed they felt that that will being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we spoke to a Seventy seven year old man African American\nWho grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina had refused admission in the lunch counters in restaurants and\nSort it as roars and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such of racism and he's view\nComing from a president or somebody in such high office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt this roar exposure\nThat's extraordinary Bruce you've been in the U.S before and as you know the mid term elections historically have low voter turnout what's it like in Australia or greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote\nWell in this trial have compulsory ... taken that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fined if we die hard but a science take it for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd then of course changes the nature of politics ... it means that the politicians are much more focused on the Santa rather than having to energize they buy all the time\nIf you're ... you're a politician and astray United that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's the people in the middle you have to convince and that means that as time politics even though it sounds very divisible times\nStill is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that on the pain the major political parties for example\nOr you know we have a national health scale which would never be touched by either of the major parties on anything in my lifetime it just is not an issue that I Know that if I were to pot from that that would be the end of the prospects of winning an election\nDo you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMassively more motivated everywhere we go way hearing reports from\nJournalists and others that turnout is greater with early voting mental registration that they Kevin uh issue has motivated and energized democratic voters particularly women\nSo on both sides were saying this remarkable energizing I'd be very surprised if we don't say ... me too I'm voting turnout and we're also getting at reports that in states like Georgia where there's been allegations of vote as oppression that that has had to resist effect and that there's been a very high\nWe're also getting a reports that in states like Georgia where there's been allegations of vote a suppression that that is how to resist effect and that there is a very high turnout before the election die by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there\nAnd one of the things that are being doing is talking to young people and asking them all or do you think about Donald Trump in the priorities that he has and I basically say\nThat totally out of step with what we are worried about and the number one issue that we get back is climate change because this is the generation that's going to have to deal with these problems and the other is intergenerational dead but they really do worry about climate and climate change\nAnd you can understand why you know I wouldn't be around to see the worst effects of climate change but they will not think that will become a bigger and bigger issue as this generation starts to assert more and more power\nBruce ... is an Australian political strategists he's been filming a documentary called a hard road travels and Trump's America we'll speak with him again after the midterms\nBy the way if you're a new U.S citizen or a voting for the first time here in America we want to hear from you what does voting mean to you and how does it compare with voting in another country\nEmail us at this address my world at the world dot org again that's my world at the world dot O.

of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point an news story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine\nThat I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and is not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk and the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans have probably says ... how we have an invasion coming or we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down their sins and the idea that we're going to be decisive flipper really defending what we ought to do is put in drones out to get targeting and do airstrikes on the migrate convoy and just stop it\nBefore it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis\nIt's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras or Guatemala [noise]\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue\nSo I think it's when we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue 'cause the route issue here\nIs one of our immigration policy and in America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy reflects those and it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led

we need to say All right what are our values what do we want from our leaders because I don't expect the president have the answers\nI expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president\nTo reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I I expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be when I Am weary and impatient I expect the president\nTo be the kind of symbol it says wow I Need to be a little more patient I Need to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a little more compassionate\nI expect the president to reflect all the things that we hope we can be\nAn does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nWhen I think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question\nI'm I'm at all when you dizzy reflect your values general\nI think I just answered that question I I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of

four years since so can you just described some of what she told you about what you went through all in ice was captivity [noise]\nIt's very hard for her to describe because it was just that they asked or should scape so she started to tell us how horrifying laws the place that they kept them ISIS so I just kept them and for base they hadn't got anything to eat [noise] they had been\nSexually abused brutally beaten some of them and\nShe's so many of her friends and families were killed by ISIS and it was horrifying and she was crying and she she cried and to be honest I cried behind the
