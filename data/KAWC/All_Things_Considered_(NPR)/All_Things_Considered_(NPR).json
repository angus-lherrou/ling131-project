I I go to our children\nAnd I heard the Iraq into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I I talked to Lisa flasher Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmothers are with us but I mean I I spend a lot of time innocent guy this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified\nAnd I hope that we could make some some changes it's not just an attack on the Jewish people but at the attack on\nOn everybody in a community and markets are strong and we're going to make it through\nAnd uh as I said she was with her knees to sixteen alley they both so you know this has many generations of the family have ties to this neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials well I wouldn't have\nHad tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and give support for the families that\nSo so what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate\nCrime well I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and and Lisa the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about me definitely need to have gotten my so we definitely don't need to have you know security guards at our school at our temple that our churches\nShouldn't have to I mean summer is supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers out to this but where we go to pray it's not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here in Reno\nWelfare you've also been getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much yeah thanks taxing\nAnd other Pittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life synagogue the ... United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during that service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor Russell ... she'll Lugar said he that he held a special surface to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nAre intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed on to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice you know we often shoe that we offer our prayers and bunch\nAnd that is funny but we must do more we much put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with her boys and with our actions we can ensure that\nThe hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there were some people who might have been afraid to come out today I did yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put your\nBeen afraid to come out today as well\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back on my open\nAnd affirming you mean that everyone every once in a while because everyone is welcomes right everyone is welcome and and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today what's it more than you expected we had a couple of ah\nFolks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer their words of Thanksgiving they do not stay to worship\nBut they do to come and to say thank you for doing this so that makes a difference\nIf I ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I do have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses and on\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events uh because he was a police officer in white hall nuts were the ... a perpetrator lives\nTo it was very frightening pros personally um but I I Try to allow God ... the urge\nTo give me the bowl ... that I Need\nI I Do not fear for myself I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren\nBut yet I can allow hatred to intimidate me\nWe also met lore has she is the nursery attendant at the church responsible for caring for the congregations littlest members during worship and for her yesterday as a tax on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony would be much being held in the presence of children hit very close to home well\nThis church has recently and kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of a situation like that and of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind said started here because I'm responsible for\nEight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I just running through my head tenants plans that I've come up for years really\nAnd is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened where are you thinking okay what what I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that tiny hook happened when I was in high school\nOr things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind and it's kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you yeah have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for the children and that's what you have to be thinking about\nWe also met a father and son older and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today and ... said his own life experiences allowed him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nAnd African American beer and ... and there were you were going over all these things are very zero through or a certain number of people to look at your front of\nA certain order field are you should be there because her zero or your caller\nMassey what about you I don't get the sense

Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\n... sounds lovely now um you also spent some time uh in squirrel hill the neighborhood with its attack occurred what was the mood there\nYeah I mean people were out in scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going through Sunday services and you could see the diversity of the communities notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of a fix president

little town like this you'd never think can happen but in today's America they realize it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to the point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I rented to Dan Franco he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school with the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal here's what he said\nThey were really specials we've known for a loan for many years whenever I go to a tree of life for a more mature a wedding or\nSome of the\nTwo of them are always a\nSanctuary\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying is next\nFelt like people run this or this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solidarity that community showing\nAnd then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents but\nThe community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said he talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence called thank you thank you\nAnd as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this\nThat are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children and how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in Studio ... thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand that you have actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately I've covered several of these now and my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible though for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified that\nSo you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood after the synagogue you also went to other places tell us about that\nActually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great when actually

synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign of rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media uh\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nReally seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back events happening right\nSomething different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the ... solar and cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is or when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any ideas what I Am more than she does that I have no\n... and since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with beef without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're battling taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that well\nYou mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm ... supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House thanks Asia thank you\nFor ...\nYou're listening to all

former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not are going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWill some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay [laughter] the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border [noise] uh I don't recall the\nPresident for sending active duty troops have been some sits in the past and again in a support role in this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot\nThese troops who are doing everything it get it from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff in a a good general showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside

their quest to win back the house of representatives Democrats are focused on twenty five house seats currently held by Republicans in districts that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen\nFlorida Republican Carlos Curbelo is in one of those districts and he's betting that his independent reputation will attract Democrats and Republicans alike NPR's Kelsey Snell reports\nCarlos Curbelo isn't shy about confrontation here is this summer bashing everybody fellow Republicans who backed President Trump's hard line on immigration and Democrats who wouldn't cut a deal attempt to protect people who were brought to the country illegally as children\nThey prefer the politics the petty politics of immigration instead of the solutions for immigration\nThat Taco Bell ever spent most of the past two years he publicly opposed Trump and Republican leaders on major issues like immigration climate change and trade but he also largely voted to back the president's agenda when it comes to health care and tax is\nNow he's running for reelection in a district that Hillary Clinton won by sixteen points and he's running a campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party\nI don't ... remember ever apologizing for anything\nI've said whatever I've said is what I Believe so why would I watch it by\nThat same approach helped him winning twenty sixteen but Democrats like Maria Elena Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade seat that independent\nInto trail so he tells the plot that he's a moderate but when you see is voting rights act that is completely not the case and unfortunately most voters do not do that\nAnd they just hear him and they say wow you know he found this theory that opponents Democrat sending the car so Powell is trying to change that you know they need information we need to provide them for me\nAnd they say wow you know he sounds like this theory that opponents Democrats ending the car so Powell is trying to\nChange that you know they need information we need to provide information and\nAnd make voting in the car so Powell is an energetic far educator mom and an immigrant from Ecuador she's running on protecting immigrants healthcare and the environment all things that occur Bello said he also wants to protect their locked in a battle to convince voters who's telling the truth\nI should be ahead basic things like that as a straight democratic district but it's not it's complicated\nConvincing voters who's right is a unique challenge in a diverse district that stretches from the suburbs of Miami south farm fields and onto the tourist hub of Key West about Seventy percent of the population is Hispanic roughly half are Cuban descent\nCurb below the son of Cuban exile gets a warm welcome from a lot of voters here he sleeps seamlessly between Spanish and English when he's talking to constituents anti parents boundary pushing politics with personal attention\nTake a recent event worker Bello and Senator Marco Rubio we're pushing back on Trump's new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada all\nHardly mentioning Trump signing we want to have strong trade relationships with our allies bought we believe that this should be fair they focused\nOn a new built out area fruit and vegetable growers who are largely left out of the new trade agreement people like Republican tomato grower Karen Carpenter said that personal connection is important\nI mean it's hard not to like the guy like that I mean it comes to listen and tries to\nDo something about the problem that affects state and who's area\nAnd um stuff fall you can I ask\nRelationships like that or the benefit of the incumbency most challengers have to convince voters that they'll follow through on their promises but McCarthy Powell also worries that the people her party needs to when people like those who work long hours and the service sector or tourism may not show up at the polls\nIf we get our people to come out and vote I when it's going to be a close race for me my focus my campaign's focus is making sure they know who I Am I message but also getting them out to to loading type the last few days of the campaign will\nCome down to who's message voters beliefs and it might help ... case that Trump himself is coming to Florida this week but not to campaign for her fellow that maybe just what he needs

years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment\nBut the fed successes also undermined one of the basic theory that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Phillips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips gr if you put it in them\nJobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips gr if you\nPut it in a murder mystery framework who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kill themselves\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the ... long persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nSo Bullard says the Philips curve isn't working but rumors of its death maybe exaggerated\nIt certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour\nSetting for pale the fellows\nIt might be arresting\nA little more central bank humor this time in apparent reference to our classics Monty Python sketch a man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parity in a cage\nTo complain about it touches so often to do this for the phone from Australia was thrilled with this was\nWhen I when I look at it was\nThe filters curve could just be resting but with the help of his sleeping pill and the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and going\nTo a different way in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhether the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nThe U.S economy extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want Rowan stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that were confirmed your belief about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say gives me relevance stable inflation\nEven if

from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turn around here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plan under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI'm at dawn Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here see motion\nA lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten\nIt's odd standing here it's emotional yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today a sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed Don Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a\nDark and scary and you know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody like losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the has the each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in a suburb beautiful here yeah very elevated you ride the lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to bank often about the auto industry the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM's pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people always great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then dumps Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace\nPolicies that eighty see you again\nToday Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nAre a little bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and reflect the bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I live in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed\n...\nDid the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\n[noise] yeah I Would say because um I at\nThat point was used to being independent he used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independents again and just couldn't handle that so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had at willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet [noise]\nI'm not saying that presented to them in and it gives me kind of emotional Indiana's I guess I always assumed that when you retire\nSo that percentage of them in and it gets any kind of emotional Indiana's I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago\nMike ... son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a cleaner on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I felt like a kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do all that you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but\nThat was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\n... [laughter]\nThose are fireworks going off overhead wired nights hair haunted thrill heart Peyton runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did it willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something in an area the current owners invited us into take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gate since that\nDay [noise] drug they him six hurting freeway was entering\nOur tour guide is Jeff Rupp he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don Skidmore seems shaken revisiting has passed\nI don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there so we\nWe left that\nAre like the trees like the leaves on the street\nIt's kinda cool kind of eerie and you know I remember when it was real\nIt's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant is now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing\nTraffic jams fog in our in\nOur cars are driving by themselves out of crazy world\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone but on the cross bar underneath and faded black paint you can barely make out the ghost of another logo United Auto workers\nAnd the name of the union chapter the Skidmore represented local seven thirty five\nThis is NPR News in less than two weeks is deeply divided nation is heading to the polls to vote in the battleground state of Pennsylvania where dozens of Gettysburg say it's time to remember history\nWe have seen an effort by the media and raised in ours to use the citizens are actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party\nThis was a Donald Trump in full grievance mode already and his partisan supporters ate it up\nThat's NPR's Scott Horsley Scott thank you You're welcome\nPresident Trump is threatening to close the U.S Mexico border tensions are rising as large numbers of migrant families continue to cross illegally and more are expected as a caravan of migrants from Central America ... north towards the border\nUs border patrol says they're overwhelmed by the influx we're joined now by NPR's John Burnett who covers immigration and is with us on the line from Austin, Texas Hi John hey Ari on TV\nThey are overwhelmed by the influx we're joined now by NPR's John Burnett who covers immigration and is with us on the line from Austin, Texas Hi Don hey Ari on T. V. we've seen dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds of miles away so why are tensions rising now\nWell the fear is really suppressing reality the sides of the Honduran care than is reportedly dropped by half from some seven thousand thirty five hundred now unexpected the fall even more the farther north it gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nI mean just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary Houston Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which people forced their way across the border that could be that\nWe had any intention right now to have people saying well the apprehended however that al ... officer and an attack at their own personal safety extraordinarily serious and they can't have an email the F ... house\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico uh ... cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he said an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of town patrolling private ranch land he got a call from another militia leader from South Carolina earlier in the week\nHe said quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me know when will be there\nThe militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol\n... we've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and this caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet or tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling that\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect\nIce will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped him were overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse\n[noise] President Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details about that\nRight the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal and international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted with the travel ban then he'll give it's his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders\nNPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas Thanks John\n\nAbout immigrants coming to our borders NPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas Thanks John [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong pace thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was three point five percent during the quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were signs of potential trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers as historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economist expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate in the second quarter still the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks are growing fast my life that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent that and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips and ate out and restaurants more\nEli Maloof is America CEO of I G the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and camped in among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nWhich set records around Labor Day an immoral David share and fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending offer for trip spending more with us\nBut it wasn't just consumers who were spending more government spending was also up Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news and today's report there were some disquieting signs business investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight tenths of a percentage point a meager number\nDespite the big cut in business taxes there is little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory ... who is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer rail you're starting to see them headwinds of caring for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that is steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen spending by people in businesses over time and there are already signs of weakness in the housing in car markets\nJacko also site say gradual slowing in the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wane by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see so much slower momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what deco calls they growing spirit of protectionism right now\nThe U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China has retaliated there's no telling what impact it will have but for now Americans are working and spending and that is keeping the growth rate strong\nJim Zarroli NPR News\nIt will have but for now Americans are working and spending and that is keeping the

Ford testify about what she said that now Supreme Court justice\nThe area Mr ... thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after ... Ford testify about what she said that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that is what motivated me I watched her testimony and I felt it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus uh the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that but my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I sit in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote it's hard to read and you know for some people it's gonna be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and a half step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual event for me\nBecause I never went to parties never so I I don't even know why I went I I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kid came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window\nTo about ten of us went out there and I happened to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a\nA girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and\nThen he starts to take her genes off\nAnd then he he he took her panties off and then he he pulled on its than any one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on his shoulders he jumped up right away\nAnd all of us out at at that window was outside\nWe all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other boys at the party started touching another young woman who was\nAlso passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes\nLater a\nShe was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching or he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told that your fault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and find out later on it was just just plain guilty you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us was that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men\nTalk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long I\nI I don't know why we've kept quiet\nA quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nSomebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't answer that I don't I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent on this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what\nWe've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it [noise] how did your family take it when you told them [noise] well\nLet let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that for this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good and how did you explain that to your boys well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh\nThey were very receptive on their dad you know dad can you know we we kinda can't do too much from in the in the eyes of our kids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it will happen now and he said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it\nThat's what they told but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they\nYeah I mean but in that sense that she wouldn't have done it because he wouldn't have wanted to be on film is yeah we film everything you know what they would kind of looting too well how do you feel now that you've got an off your chest you know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings I'll be honest there there are days when\nI regret it and then there are days that I'm Glad I did you know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people\nSome women have said it's about time some of it it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit that a lot of women ah said ah they were glad I did it they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a salted\nWho wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good\nYou know your piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if either help these women then but I didn't do it\nDumps hammering thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many

nothing about the operation claim viewed with skepticism outside the kingdom\nNow to understand the aims of the Turkish government we're joined by Amanda slowed she's a senior foreign policy fellow at Brookings she just got back from is down below come to the program thank you so to give us some context there was a rift between these two countries right that predates this incident what's going on there\nYeah absolutely some of the tension goes back to the Arab Spring of twenty ten when Turkish president then prime minister air to want assumed that like minded governments led by some of these Islamist parties\nWould come to power this fell apart for him in twenty Thirteen in Egypt when the Muslim Brotherhood elected leader Morsi who was an ally of turkey was overthrown in a coup by cc who

he's likely to be in power for a number of decades and I think everyone always saw him as being particularly ah unfavorable to Turkish regional interests and so I think what we're likely to see from

try and impose maximum damage on NBS\nMeaning he wants them replaced a new air called\nIdeally I think you would like NBS removed or at least weekend in terms of removing his de facto powers on on the foreign policy side\nSo is this speech directed really add to President Trump the U.S is that the the nation that could bring that pressure to bear\nA air to one certainly recognizes that turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own and so it really is going to be as you say the United states that is going to have to do this\nSustaining members are a big reason we've been able to

auctioned by such a prestigious art house now that is new\nArt appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale and she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you a pleasure to be here Elsa how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the euro and oh by Marcel Just chomp where he literally took and then hearing on the hog it on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I went to the lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art\nIt's um I once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand that things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to tell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nTo the artist in this case is it the ... who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the ... the collective and maybe even a little bit of a ... for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would garner the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work has gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off into this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened\nBecause this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it at a smaller limited and numbered edition after that sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Marie ... is the CEO of rare era appraisals just outside of Washington DC thank you very much thank you so much pleasure alpha\n[noise]

you for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican in New Hampshire\nRunning for reelection he's the only openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate thanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae be two people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that as we get broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run\nA million ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu and I think you know we've we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um\nAnd and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae beauty woman being a first generation American being a veteran I think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin what try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um\nWe actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballads that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou get the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades and the way it relates to el GB to people do you think that shapes your experience yeah\nThis is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that it I've got you know some wonderful fellow than in turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to uh [laughter]\nI I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nBecause then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nThe Trump Administration has rolled back algae beauty cue writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the algae community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae beat GQ candidate fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially trans woman of color into their political scene I'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people\nAnd we have all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know that there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely a discuss which is you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think it's less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community in our country at this point\nYeah one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure Gina in the mail you do as well\nTo those young people that are following behind us\nI Want to thank all three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for

at stake for health care in the midterms\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove recently wrote an op ed about health care that was headlined the sleeper issue of twenty Eighteen the alarm clock is about to go off voters like Lou Hendricks in Kansas City are telling pollsters healthcare is a defining issue as they get ready to cast their midterm votes\nOr the big concerns that we have as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions\nDemocratic Senator Claire McCaskill who's in a tough battle for re election in Missouri is trying to tap into that concern McCaskill described your own struggle with breast cancer in a new campaign at\nI don't talk about it much but does he face cancer and any other illnesses have a pre existing condition when it comes to health coverage\nMcCaskill blast her Republican opponent Josh Hawley for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and it's a requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a person's medical history Republicans insist they will protect patients with preexisting medical conditions though they've been vegan saying how\nDemocrats around the country have seized on this issue Erika Franklin Fowler directs the Media Project at Wesleyan University says healthcare dominates congressional campaign at out pacing jobs taxes and immigration\nDemocrats had been laser focused on health care that's here\nIt's the mirror image of what we saw in past election cycles when Fowler says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet\nRegardless of how Americans feel about the ... provisions that ... that are very popular once it became clear that those visions are in trouble I think that had something to change the landscape of how politicians will talk about it that cycle\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even of Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans won the ability to finish the job that they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away at Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nThe president will still be in office and his initiation will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation healthcare research organization once\nYou're likely to see is much greater and even fears over side of the administration's efforts to change and then he would say undermine the AC a\nLoo Hendricks the voter we heard from earlier calls himself a fan of the Affordable CARE Act even though he's a Republican Hendricks who's retired used to get insurance through his employer but more and more he's leaning towards a single payer insurance system which progressive advocates like to call Medicare for all\nIt makes it easier and simpler for every body with the exception of Blue Cross Blue Shield enter the medical insurance company here\nEven if they win is sweeping midterm victories Democrats

minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic

nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like

Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint where I had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all and in the United states so yeah that's awful\nReporters posed many scenarios and oh and answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he had clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis and Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nBecause even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that so just to ...\nThe officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nJust to parse that sat there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister true though he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which should take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admits that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\nLynn centers in immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and the problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour

ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking somebody's trying to get in and the inside door was shaking I knew the rough

reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities on the panhandle in many cases gets old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida is not a bunch of high rises out a lot of construction this is all the generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks\nNot a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all the generational of Florida families any of them were just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade and Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings

in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes on the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction need only withstand when speed one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid

much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of housing what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig view gate has long believed wind speeds

the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered Kate thanks for having me why people leave Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats inhalation and diversity and I'd love to see ... policies change not to have faith in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to that\nRace is sort of something that is becoming not just nearly factor but often times the fact that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard as saying that they can do that but like ... in showing in the past few days and it has brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that kind of found someone church action\nOut there and missions as a group of ...\nIt has really brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents burned missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see the repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use of personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in the case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans all to the front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI Do think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\nI'd like you to respond to something the Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo\nI think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources an opportunity to people have available to them it's really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at net in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone who's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to realizing admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division and sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about

in and also the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment that with quickly to huge queues at the ports coming into person\nAnd very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very tail shaken damaging ... for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens talk of stockpiling of medicines\nFairs the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big his\nFigure saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some talk of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nDon't you just used for the checks the place where there are ... for the moment you can have she's running ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant from the poor so pretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best than people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what was happening in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red type on the board is not without to business costs\nWill make it ... percent or less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential fatalities as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would it be in the case which is a pretty big\nHits and spit out into sort of an aircraft crunchy losing hide she wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person have clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European exports so they would be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's some and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nOr you name it they will they will be effective because UK off to practice it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is is an asymmetric shock well it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest loses will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more the lesson to be honest I I mean we all quiet at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does the deal and Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think that she negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... and still despite all the negative noises around is that common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at

the migrants no more deaths have used that as an effort by the government to crack down on groups providing aid to those trucking the desert\nWhat we see on duty Ajay now that they're going after the

religious liberty sessions created a task\nForce to help the Justice Department do so one of its jobs just to make sure the cases the OJ attorneys bringing defend and the arguments they make in court aren't aligned with federal protections for religious freedom\nThat includes making sure our employees know their duty to accommodate the full of fame as the people in this room know you have to practice what you preach but some say the Justice Department\nIs failing to do just that instead they say it is selectively supporting religious liberty again Frankie\nThere's a public face of this

Arizona [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nThe immigration authorities are rating more and more American businesses it looked like something that you typically would CEO to the movies not something you ever plan on living out in real life\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his big when a president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nOh All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you [laughter]\nNow for all the focus on how the Democratic party is shifting to the left nationally\nIf Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district it is a deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams\nOr in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump pressure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for the country and one is good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be part of that\nThat's all no accident the county officials and former state senator note that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them

race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly what I'm working with I build relationships on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the ...\nOn both sides of the aisle love as aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump\nMost notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slur to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong\nAnd it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judge based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAt the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam said he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keeps his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift they aren't calling for single payer health care or impeachment\nSo if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderate shifts party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back power got

according to the international council of shopping centers over the last five years more malls have opened and closed mark comment as a former CEO of Sears Canada he now teaches at Columbia Business school\nHe told me some malls will actually benefit from all the Sears stores shutting down\nThere are AAA or super regionals as they refer to\nWho are booming who are\nReceiving the news of Sears demise or near demise with glee\nBecause if Sears is still doing business in in their facility they're happy to take the space back these are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully tentative and they're only limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor store but they've got others American what would they do with the space\nWell they're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their spiritual opportunity in the form of added food offerings things of that sort okay and then there are B and C malls and these are smaller these tend to be older\nIn many cases they've already lost the Sears\nAnd the prognosis for these bees and sees is grim\nWhy can't they do the same thing as the ... cat they re imagined the space and out of food court or something\nThey can do it on paper but they can manage it financially because the malls volume has declined to the extent that there is no financial viability left\nWhen you talk

declined uh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on tech and on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of a close\nAnd the whole idea that an over
