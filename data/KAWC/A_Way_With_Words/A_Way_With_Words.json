Petersen thank you so much for being here to\nAlso here in Studio Arizona Public media dancing on ... and from our debate partners Joe Ferguson of the Arizona Daily Star in the ... are NPR sister station in Phoenix ...\nThey finally begin here are the rules for tonight's discussion each candidate will get a sixty second opening and closing statement in between our panel of journalists will ask questions from the list they prepared\nThe candidates have not seen the question the question is will be directed to one candidate who will have one minute to respond and the other candidate we'll have thirty seconds to robot\nIf one of our journalists out they follow question both candidates will have forty five seconds to respond well alternate who get each question and we will strictly enforced the time limits if a candidate repeatedly exceeds has a lot of time we may seed extra time to the other candidate in an effort to balance the opportunity for our audience to hear from both of them\nNow for opening statements first based on a drying beforehand Mr ...\nThank you very much and what's that goes on a public media and the journalists that are here to ah help facilitate this discussion uh\nThis election is important and uh there was a public meetings giving the voters an an opportunity to access and decide which candidate they could support in this very consequential midterm elections the consequential\nFor a lot of reasons but one reason that I Want to point out is the the deficit a night but two thousand eight team this year the deficit is going to be seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars\nThat that deficit is tied directly to the tax cuts that were given what eighty three percent of the richest in the country and the multinational corporations benefit from those tax cuts those are consequences that affect every American and when a majority in Congress\nHas an opportunity I Would it be part of that majority to begin to change some of these decisions that have been made that in the long term are going to hurt the American people\nThinking ... and now Mr Peterson your one minute opening statement\nThank you learn and thank you I was on a public media I was born into Dallas Arizona and grew up on the Indian reservations my roots run deep and the district living just outside of gerrymandered district does not make me care lesser blamed me to the fact that the district\nHas one of the lowest K. through twelve educational test scores and all of the four hundred and thirty five congressional districts this includes graduation rates\nIt does not blame me to the fact that this congressional district has ... per capita incomes in the country that does not blame me to the fact that our veterans do not receive adequate health care or the border\nIsrael with drugs and human trafficking nor does it want me to the fact that in the sixteen years the incumbent has no solutions to improve these conditions and raise the quality of life of its constituents\nUnlike my opponent I have no obligations to special interest groups\nWould never call for a boycott of the state I'm committed to work towards measurable change in the incomes ... education rankings veteran care\nAnd border security and eight term sixteen years my opponent and hasn't been unable to fix either because he is unable to her because he is doesn't care about politics has become a family situation and he has profited from it\nIs unable to her because he is doesn't care about politics has become a family situation and he has profited from it not the people\nThinking this appears in now on to the question did trick three includes a majority of our state border with Mexico so this first round of focus on issues related to border security and immigration the first question goes to Mr ... from a VPN Nancy monthly\n[noise] Mr getting however there are many people across this country who feel that undocumented immigrants uh especially from Mexico and Central America are real drain on our community resources what's your take on that and can you give me some examples but I I think\nWhat has to put that question and\nIn in the context of what what has occurred for the last Eighteen months it even prior to that we've had a a a a very divisive ah\nAttack on anything immigrant in this country by the president and others we've had an enforcement only policy or by the president and others and his apartment of homeland security what we have is a border\nIs very much an issue of economic the economic failure on the part of other parts of ... of Latin America but more importantly what we have at the border is\nAn opportunity and what we're concentrating right now is an enforcement and division it's no secret that everybody running for office goes and take the picture and all that lives in front of of the wall and says this is what I Want to do\nThe issue is much more complex it ... it requires comprehensive approaches of solutions time we talked about solutions and not just continuing to batter a dead horse about an issue that\nIs political rhetoric and really know solutions and be offered by the majority in Congress\nAnd is your parents and you have thirty seconds first fine\nWell obviously the the borders are complex situation it's going to take an enforcement of the regulations that we now have but it also involves a comprehensive immigration reform and I'm for providing away for for the people to be treated with dignity\nAnd where they can earn a path to citizenship and I'll discuss more of that later\nThank you the next question is from Joe Ferguson at the Arizona Daily Star for Mr Peterson\nTo Paris and the ... reports doesn't even hundreds of migrants being arrested in ... Arizona that served in the past few months what the federal Bruce into these mass meant mitigation patterns\nWould you be that question of course the ball patrol reports groups of thousands even hundreds of migrants are being arrested in Arizona desert in the past few months what's the federal tuition to these mass migration patterns\nSolutions to these mass immigration patterns is is threefold one\nWe have to provide border security we have to provide comprehensive immigration reform we have to provide a path for citizenship that includes dignity and we're promoting our red white and blue ... plan the red plan would be where people can\nUm announced that they are here and then there's going to be a moratorium on the um\nOn on deportations the white plan is where Congress will agree and pass and fund\nAnd impervious wall on the Mexico and us border and three when the wall or in the when the barrier not the wall but when the barriers complete then the path to citizenship can be established so that everybody does in our community can uh live here with dignity\nOr how they you know thirty seconds for a response\nThe issues is is is a is an issue that cannot be easily\nResolved with a ball it cannot be easily results\nThe issues is is is a is an issue that cannot be easily\nResolved with a ball it cannot be easily resolved enforcement only attitude decision is a is an issue that deals with poverty\nIt deals with persecution it deals with political upheaval and Central America in particular and it deals with with with the very fundamental native people we saw the moms and and the kids to flee situation\nAnd to look for an opportunity and the United states is viewed by many in the world is that opportunity so the fundamental issue is building a capacity within within the ... the countries that are sending people and people are fleeing bill capacity civil society rule of law long term uh\nUh local governments on the ... century's and and the and the federal government so it takes leadership to accomplish this obviously it hasn't been done to the degree that it needs to be in the past\nFive forty question comes from Ferguson this one is for Mr Pearce and Joe\nShapiro and this is one of nine districts in a country that border Mexico what does the law she can fail to understand about life and economics here\nWhen life and economics on the district are very important\nWashington fail to understand about life and economics here\nWhen life and economics on the district are very important\nWhat we need to have is someone who's going to work hard to improve the economic and living conditions in the district it saddens me when I go to know gallons it saddens me when I see parts of San Luis it saddens me when I'm In parts of of of of the\nSouth Tucson in the west side and to see the the state of the economic and living conditions in the district so I don't think a lot of people across the country understand that and that's something that we need to do\nIt takes leadership it takes working with a business and government and the the local institutions to improve the opportunities for our citizens to is to improve their wages\nAnd cigarette ... thirty seconds far as the stereotype about the borderlands and it is prevalent in Washington a among Congress and the leadership in Congress right now that this is a political issue and so people culture diversity potential\nAnd opportunity ... are not part of the equation this because this is political fodder in DC they can't take a picture to leave and never stop to understand both the history and the importance of this border region I\nThink Mr ... we have a follow up question now this one comes from the ... the county's indicate which candidate you'd like to answer first as a minder both candidates will have forty five seconds to answer that question\nA mystery hunger among all of your legislation that you have supported and tried to put forth on the border are what are you most proud of and what what has been your biggest accomplishment\nI thought I thought the the effort the legislative efforts are\nHaving been\nAccepted as legislative effort and when I began this process very few supported that moment of changed considerably in the last four years and we have some opportunities\nThe successes are convincing the previous administration about the need for stimulus packages ... son at least so that we could start to build up that infrastructure\nThe quarter going from the valley is a Tucson or that now receive twenty five billion dollars very proud of that and so it has been a consequence of having someone in the White House that was appreciative of that\nAnd supported the local communities are legislatively it's got to be comprehensive reform and uh so far has been an appetite by these majorities in Congress even tackle that\nI Need to stop you there Mr Peterson yeah forty five seconds to respond [noise]\nAs far as uh the question that Mr motor sports just huh yes certainly well one thing that um\nThe incumbent has failed to tell it says that he had very little to do with the that money going to the border communities the other legislators worked very hard at that and and he's a\nHappy to be in on the on the goodies on that\nSo it's an important area takes leadership and it takes someone as he mentioned that that can get the agreement of the others in Congress and I believe he's not in a position because of his views where he's going to be able to accomplish that and that's why we need change\nThat includes our segment on board or related questions we now turn our attention to issues related to the environment the first question is from a VPN Nancy Montoya different instruments or to have a reminder one minute response please\nRamos how ... and I know both of you are bilingual so you know that means water um if they're good at ...\nI'm going to have ... and I know both of you are bilingual so you know that means water on Mr ... to ... um about the Colorado River watershed odd situation what should be the federal government's role\nI in having some kind of a drought contingency plan what should the federal government's role will be in that\nI think it's a federal government's role was all got to the Colorado River has to be full active\nAnd right now just got a city back under this administration and see what the state of Arizona and their own stumbling around them what to do with a water management plan for the state given droughts\nGiven scarcity given the finite reality of that resource or the federal government to step in and provide guidance the Colorado is a resource for Seventeen million people countless businesses\nFrom here to Southern California and be on\nAnd so it is a resource that needs to be preserved we can not allow uranium mining around the Grand Canyon to preserve that water source and we cannot let this assistance to continue to happen without having contingency plans and this inquires choices and this requires a\nUser's a to understand that sometimes the highest users and consumers of water in the state or have to take a ... step toward the reality that we have now that we have to conserve this water and manage it much better than we're doing now\nThank you Mr Pearce and you have thirty seconds for response\nWill do the water issue is a state issue that needs to be resolved between the participating states in the central Arizona project\nOf preferred that the federal government not not be involved\nAnd as far as the local sources of water currently we are to the city of Tucson is on CAP water and my biggest concern is the contamination level\nSo I think one of the biggest things we can do is for a legislation that will create a national standard for for where the water quality and this is one thing that is missing in and we need scientific help on this\nThank you now question from ... from the Arizona Daily Star this one is for Mr Peterson\nPearson how ... works in Congress to prioritize what are often seen as western issues such as federal versus private land use\nPrivate land use 'em should first be taken up by the state one of the things that are I Would be in favor of is that the federal lands more of those federal lands be turned over to the state so that this could increase the educational trust when an increased revenues from the state trucks funds\nAnd with so much of the federal lands are in the state being controlled by federal and a\nTribal entities that doesn't leave us much for the say trust lands and I think we should also\nSwap out land that that should be in the state trust land some of our state trust land is the name of proving ground so we should change a swap land out so that that land that we can't use right now that some of the human proving grounds be part of the state trust land so creative things like that should be done that would increase the revenue to find our schools\nAre highly you have thirty seconds for for\nThe public lands in Arizona and along the southwest are essential\nAnd a oversight by the federal government is essential\nRight now this administration has made the public lands uh uh one dimensional resource extraction oil gas mining period\nAnd that's a are public lands and our waterways as well like the Colorado or a run national resource and I think that the prospect of the federal government could bring to this is that we need to protect those that he'd be conserved ... what do they need to be conserved and more importantly as we look at climate change\nAnd that reality and as we looked at what's going on with water in that reality those public lands\nIt'd be conserved and more importantly as we look at climate change and that reality and as we looked at what's going on with water in that reality those public lands becoming valuable in terms of how they fit into that picture\nAnd remind you will stick to the time limits any uh overcast will result in a penalty later that sinister Hama this one is trying to tell them anything from our NPR sister station in Phoenix ...\nHave to have two questions first or do you favor Arizona implementing strict water conservation throughout the state and secondly in a follow up how would you work with the Arizona Governor to balance out our water needs with our gross\n[noise] yeah the ... the the domestic use the household use of water are in this state has increased ... actually is we have grown in population\nAnd and that has to be accommodated and and the issue of the use of water by mining companies has to be accommodated this has to be looked at in terms of how much they use how much certain ... certain crops used in terms of how\nThe high use of water they had that has to be a factor and and and the governor and\nOther elected officials must begin to look at those options of those hard choices that they're facing a I think to ignore the fact that this finite resources going down is a mistake another thing I Would do is this a shared water a permit that is given to ah to developers like along the ... that the court just went for\nAssured water seems to be has no criteria to it a assured water should really mean that scientifically assured water and I think many times they're handed out as part of a development agreement when in reality there and our water we're losing\nThank you Mr Pearce and you have thirty seconds farmers thought\nWell we're going to be fighting all over the world for water and it and in Arizona we really need to address that so one of my biggest concerns is local\nAnd that local concerns involved or water table which at the moment has too many contaminates contaminants and this problem needs to be addressed because if there is a drought situation Tucson is going to be one of the first ones to be suffering from this\nI think the question in front of ... for Mr Peterson\nYou balance the urban and rural needs in this district that includes metro Tucson\nSome Phoenix suburbs plus vast stretches of sparsely populated town how would you balance is all out\nWith the needs of the district are similar in that we all of the areas in the district require\nAccess to jobs they require access to quality education so these opportunities that exist in the difference a district are not unique to a new urban area as opposed to a rural area\nSo we need to provide resources in in both urban and rural areas that are going to be beneficial for youth\nProvide a job opportunities increase opportunities for them to\nTo do better in life and to improve their standard of living in an economic and living conditions\nThis really needs to be done on the reservations that needs to be an older small communities and this takes cooperation between the business sector of the private sector government and educational institutions so that takes a lot of work that takes a lot of cooperation to in order to do this\nThinking this or how they you have thirty seconds they\nCreate a balance and I and I think what was Seventy percent of the population is in the urban areas in this district email\nAnd Tucson primary and but that's only thirty percent of the land mass Seventy percent of the ... rural smaller communities in rural areas and what's needed there is not just the issue of access is the issue of infrastructure and the the issue of we catch it a health care\nBasic services broadband even get into those communities and so if you're going to deal with rural America or it's not just a question of waiting for Santa Claus I think there has to be initiatives on the part of of the federal government to provide\nThank you Mr ... how are you there and we did a follow up question often related to the environment is some kind of Tron or district or issues related to a congressional districts three is on comes from Nancy Montoya [noise] I'm\nFrom Mr Pearson it's been a lot of the political reality is that a an elected official at the federal level is only as powerful as the committees you get placed on a if you are like that or what specific committee would you say to be appointed to in order to help this district\nWell first of all in helping this district I can help the district most\nFrom working from the local level I Will work hard to be on the other committees in Congress\nFrom working from the local level I Will work hard to be on the other committees in Congress I understand that you have to buy yourself a position on a lot of those committees but I Will work locally fairly by yourself\nWell I've understood that some of the positions you have to contribute money to your uh to the leadership to get a position\nSo I'm going to start locally and improve the economy and the living conditions in the district as best I can and I'm going to do the best I can to improve and gain access to committees um in in ... in Congress what committees\nWell the education committee is an important one we need to get more funding uh for here and also the um education or the immigration to protect the border and and to improve the border security and to work on the immigration reform\nThank you Mr could hardly yeah forty five seconds\nSort of re elected will repay the committee say have\nAnd that if I'm fortunate enough to be in the majority I Will be chairman of the national Resources Committee\nAnd the second most senior member of the education and workforce committee so to some of the things and legislation concepts\nThat President majorities for the last eight years and not allow even to to be hurt or a committee hearings will now have an opportunity to be debated and go through regular order if I have that opportunity and I'm reelected ... that I Would stay on the committees that among\nThinking now for the remainder tonight's debate or panel will be asking questions covering a variety of issues facing the district and the nation you know for ... years on Daily Star question now for Mr ...\n... am glad you mentioned regular order Congress hasn't passed the fall but for your budget in a very long time that it passes a bunch of short term temporary measures you know and it's continuing resolutions he's get federal agencies little room to plan to make changes to get Congress and the president a tool for negotiating policy\nWould you advocate for or against the pattern and bought a budgeting\nAgainst I think one of the things that the house of representatives has to do as a poll equal member of Congress and up an important responsibility for the United States Congress house of representatives is to develop the budget\nAnd to develop the budget to each committee process\nTo have hearings to look at each agency and then from that budget is adopted then you go through the appropriations process of how you are going to spend that money or you haven't done that just been piecemeal of that we have a good we're working under the continuing resolution till December seventh right now and nobody could plan\nWe don't have an infrastructure bill we don't have a transportation bill we don't have a farm bill and uh I think that the American people deserve a much better they deserve some consistency and some ability to know\nWhat that decision is the impact on them for that year and following years and we're not doing that\nIt's your parents and you know have thirty seconds for response\nWell obviously we all would like a balanced budget at the federal level the problems are many in designing a budget\nWhat needs to be done as you need to get agreement among both parties that we're going to be at a certain spending level and to take into consideration unfunded liabilities those are going to be hitting us we have a future liabilities in terms of health care for elderly\nAnd so it's it's a difficult situation but we need to work hard on that\nQuestion now from ... from the money's got this question instruments your Pearson\nOr border towns and the the three were hurting economically um prominent businesses have shuttered main streets are drying up and go ... Douglas and sudden Louis\nThey're hurting economically a prominent businesses have shuttered main streets are drying up and ... Douglas in St Louis [noise]\nSo what do you propose to support these local areas as they attempt to bring some sort of economic stability or business back to the main streets well that's\nA very important problem that we have all along the border and and the border cities what we need to do and what I have spent my life doing is working with small to medium sized businesses\nAnd working within the community within the community organizations the nonprofit boards that I worked on the grading the consensus on solutions to the problems so one of the things that we need to do is work with the public sector of the private sector and the educational institutions in the community so that we can find ways to\nSolve the problems in terms of a growing the economy and you need to create an environment that will that will provide for businesses to girl\nI Will put a lot of energies into promoting business growth throughout the district and we need to create more educational opportunities this involves training our students with vocational training so they can\nAdvance in their in their careers and and we can attract more employers to provide better salaries\nMichigan Javier thirty seconds\nFor you the the border to build that I referenced earlier had a major component of economic development and and I think that it's a good time to talk about investment because part of this whole discussion is a magically it'll happen no there\nAt the role the federal government has an area like the border that you pointed out those needs is to invest in it ... device to fix those ports of entry or to work\nIn order to lift and diversify the economy along that border it's an investment strategy and by having an investment strategy then you begin to develop the economic development activity that needs to happen on the border without\nWithout it without an investment the federal government which has occurred for the last decade we continue to sit around poodles and our terms and hoping something will happen that's to be an initiative\nAnd now question from Arizona Public media in asking this question for Mr Gadhafi again and one minute response thirty second our bottles from Mr Pearson\nMr guinea have you been arrested for a protesting a some federal policies\nAnd you speak harshly about the president and about the Republican Party how does that serve your guest strict\nWell I think it it serves under the fence said you know I I said before I wasn't elected to Congress to be a potted plant I have a voice and I think that voice is representative of the majority of the district and I use that voice and and to point out\nUh what Trump is doing enough varieties of an arena is I think my responsibility\nTo question and to be an effective opposition to some of the initiatives that the Republican majorities are doing it in Congress and the thing is they're not doing I think that's my responsibility as well because if if we are going to talk about change in the future then I think people need to know where you're coming from\nWhat's your position is and not hide from it and I I think people that know me know that that I don't have a problem telling people what my position is and I don't have a problem opposing things that I think are hurtful to the district and we'll aggravated situation even more worse than it is right now",

also really fascinated by weather and particularly by clouds he wants to organize how we understand and observe the ever changing formations up in the sky and he wanted to do it in a way that was scientific\nAnd Eighteen oh three self published a pamphlet that he called on the modifications of clouds et cetera\nIn it he proposed the classification system for clouds and he drew on his school boy Latin\nAnd came up with the main categories which were serious strata and cumulus not serious comes from the Latin for hair or temporal strategy is comes from the Latin for layer and cumulus is like a pile you know like accumulate\nAnd this new way of looking at clouds and these new names in this whole new language for talking about something that everybody at always seen but never really classified that way it hit a nerve in the popular imagination and look Howard became this reluctant scientific celebrity\nCulture was championed by some of the greatest minds of his time especially the influential German poet gr to\nGo to win so far as to write poems based on those names and some people criticized Howard for using Latin rather than everyday spoken English and gr to wrote a passionate response or on Howard's the half\nAnd he argued that the Latin cloud name should be accepted in all languages they should not be translated because in that way the first intention of the inventor and founder of them is destroyed and he even went on to send Howard gushing fan mail which is kind of hard to imagine today\nThe story of all of this is told by historian Richard hamblin in the book the invention of clouds how an amateur meteorologist forge the language of the skies and in fact if you go to his house\nRichard handling in the book the invention of clouds how an amateur meteorologist forge the language of the skies and in fact if you go to his home in London there's a historical marker that says Luke Howard numerous clouds lived and died here know that may not clouds\nThat will be ... dream of when we come up with a word we want the acclaim recognition that knowledge um right going to be part of history right and he got that ... is your fan yeah I Know I met any of my dining his eyes with heart disease and blood or if the Howard\n[laughter] yeah forget the house [laughter]\nI never knew that story I just I just thought some scientists came up with yeah these names but we still use them today\nYeah absolutely and they're not intact and other languages right they are modified to fit the different languages that they've\nBeen borrowed actually I don't know that there is it pretty clear system of classification of class and I don't know\nSo I like how it plugs into in the development of meteorology as a as a science where we started to realize that some of those old saw about the red sky or when I had a little bit of truth and we could look at the sky to see what was going to happen a little later with\nOur weather exactly trace this guy with the painters fresh the wins around using little rushed talking about serious clown yeah\nAnd what I also love about this is that it was a way of using language to impose order\nOn something that didn't seem to have any order it seems that Luke Howard was with someone who who saw differences in clouds in South patterns and indeed um began meteorology that way\nI have often thought that if there were another species on this planet had the same kind of active intelligence to humans that they might actually call us a word that means the class of fires\nBecause that is so much of what humans to weed sort organized we classify and if you were to think about our primary behavior a lot of it has to do with the things that we say the things that we produce how we organize ourselves in our community about\nSetting these boundaries and then this is a box and all of things of this type go in that box I\nHave to write the class is higher so I really like that and of course language is key to that right in ... making sense of the world we love language and if you come across the passions that talks about language in a way that you really enjoy we want to know and we want to share it

email words\nThat we would radio dot org hello you're on the way with words\nAt my name is ... and I'm from Indianapolis, Indiana\nWelcome to the show that's only how can we help you\nThe phrase that my grandmother used to use a she grew up in North Carolina and she would say crazy as a bit sea bug\nCrazy isn't bad the bugs [laughter] and now crazy that\nIs sad thing because it was never like if someone made her laugh she wouldn't say oh you know some people say oh you're so crazy or something like that she would never use it in that way it was if somebody was doing something that she thought was stupid\nOh man she would say that part of it is crazy over this [laughter]\nAnd I I haven't heard it much um I spent some time and when I was a child in North Carolina I heard it there but as far as the north I've not heard it even from people who've come from the same region\nUh-huh and have you heard the term Betsy bug it all\nNow and I had no idea I Know I should I should look that up more but I have no idea what a bad thing [laughter]\nWell we can tell what a Betsy bag is it's um it's a kind of beetle it also goes by the name patent leather beetle which kind of gives you an idea it's it's kinda\nBad big is your thumb and and black and shiny sometimes called the horned beetle but it's also called abet sea bug or best bug or Bessie bug\nAnd um you see this phrase crazy as Betsy bug or different variations of that that throughout the south and nobody really knows why a ... might be considered crazy except it does make an interesting sand is kind of like a you know when you disturb it it makes it kind of\nReally like a little running when you when it gets annoyed with you\nKnow like\nThat kind of a you know kind of a ... you know they're pretty sizable and I'm In this beautiful black patent leather looking thing\nI guess that's why it's crazy because other bugs don't talk to you [laughter]\nYeah you don't really see them swarming I'd only seen them you know just wandering around kind of well maybe maybe you're right\nIt is [laughter] so\nThat's where there were there and that's why I wanted that that's why I said it wasn't when she knew there was quite the opposite when she was just wonderful\nThey are going to say to me I was really bloody recall ... spoke with us\nToday thank you so much I'm so happy live folk and with both of you okay for work and I kept listening as well thanks who I thought I actually hello you have a way\nWith words a little joke from will from Wyoming Joseph welcome to the show how can we help you I have a question about from par or under par when it's used as a Gulf term on her power as a desirable\nI have a question about sub par or under par when it's used as a Gulf term on our power as a desirable thing for states that you want to find yourself in almost every other endeavor that I can think of being under our\nIs not something you want to find yourself\nRight right right\nAll right so we can explain this there are two different\nScales here two different measuring scale\nAnd so what you need to remember is that each sport has its own way of considering something a really great score are really good score for example if you got to sixty nine in golf that's usually pretty good if he got a sixteen and basketball people that are not a very good games you get a sixty nine and baseball people like securing\nYou're sitting ready to go to a store [laughter]\nSo we're talking about different measuring the scales for each part of life not just sports and golf has this really interesting thing where they start with a an agreed upon number so say sixty nine and you go a little bit above her a little bit below but that number is considered standard are par the number that up professional\nProbably could reach on this course ... given sufficient time and expertise and and some experience on that car so so golf is a scale that low to high and some with low being better and so many other things most of the rest of things in life\nAre the skill it's high to low was hiding better and so it's just that court so we're still talking about part of being standard average or that\nThe police that we are going to compare ourselves against it just to golf new low score and everything else almost you need a high score but that's what you're saying the sub par that we use in everyday life actually doesn't come some golf it's just golf borrowed its power from regular English and the regular part to standard usage of par\nWere part of the number that you're going to try to beat and go above them so it's a path justice thank you for your call we really appreciate it thank you but I already have a\nLanguage has its cord but sports oh it's just an extra ... words seemed to go\nThis was actually bought walls\nWell simply [noise]\nJoin us for hearing now tomorrow morning from tend to noon Iran case a double you see any point nine FM and K. A. W. seat dot org\nPaid all you see is supported by the human county library district offender for information community enrichment recreational reading and lifelong learning the library has eight locations and offers a range of resources services classes and informative event more information is available at Yuma library dot org\nYou're listening to a way with words that show about language and how we use it I'm grant\nBeret and Martha Burnett when is the last time you really listen to silence I've been thinking about that ever since reading a passage from a book by Paul Goodman called speaking in language here's what he has to say about silence\nNot speaking in speaking are both human ways of being in the world and there are kinds in grades if each there's the dumb silence of slumber or apathy\nThis sober silence that goes with the solemn animals face the first will silence awareness pass cheering the soul when to merge new thoughts the active silence of alert perception ready to say this this the musical silence that accompanies absorbed activity\nThe silence of listening to another speak catching the drift in helping him be clear\nThe noisy silence of resentment and self recrimination loud and sub vocal speech but cell and to say it\nBaffled silence\nThe silence of peaceful accord with other person's or communion with the cosmos\nAnd I was struck by that passage I keep thinking about it because it really lays out lots of different kinds of silence mhm and when do we ever get to hear silence to begin with\nTrue silence not knowing what's right and the pilots right I don't think we do one of the things that I have read about in the last couple of years is the parts of speech that are silent\nWhere we think of language is being but talking part ... language is also the part where we stopped talking it's also the part where we leave a space for ourselves or for others to pick up the threat\nPart of the language is also the part where we stopped talking it's also the part where we live in space for ourselves or for others to pick up the thread or to continue the conversation that silence is just as important as the other incidents\nMhm yeah when I Do improv it's you know one has a compulsion to keep talking but sometimes the most powerful moments are when you're completely quiet\nVia that compulsion to keep talking in the old cop and journalists trick right where you sit quiet for just a minute to her for the interviewee is going to feel like they have to fill it rained thing that they shouldn't have said\nRight the term for that in art is horror vacuum yeah I've I fear as as the vacuum\nYou don't have to say that I appreciate science I'm a guy who wears earplugs when I work and when I sleep I like quite a lot I mean a lot of money but I'm also the guy who on his podcast player app\nSet to take the silence on gas so they can fit more into my listening actually speed up the ... I don't anymore I used to do that because uh it's you have to give it a hundred percent of your attention when it's a really fast right now I used to but now I think which helps quite a bit you can take\nFor every ten hours I listen I can take out about an hour of pilots depending on the podcast wait you take out your medical playing as quickly it automatically removed the silence and people paused or there's a break between segments or that sort of thing\nOh man I guess it depends on the topic what pod cast your listeners thoughtful\nPodcast become friends can mimic unfortunately so pulled Goodman silence and his book speaking of language facts assignments that I really want\nThose are the moments that I really appreciate how rare they are having to going to say even in a church which we think of as being assignment place there's still some of the air conditioning and the cars outside and\nThe kids in Bible study writing or ... even at a funeral or someplace like that there's music playing in the hallway and quite whispered conversations there's no real silent\nMhm yeah I guess that's what meditation is all about the right just letting those thoughts float through your mind\nWe'd love your thoughts on science is a part of communication and language he seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three\nEmail words that we were radio dot org hello you have a way with words Hi Hi this is a\nWill calling from Lexington, Kentucky and I had a question about I'm washing machines and dishwashers\nYeah sure we'll get the repair guys out and we'll get that sorted\n[laughter] ah actually is a bit of a more of a nomenclature question before we moved into the the new house that we have here we did not have one of the automatic dish washing machine we were just doing things by hand\nSo I was calling it the washing machine for a while a which apparently is reserved for the call was washing machine\nSo I was just curious are two things one why does the clothes washing machine ... the official moniker a washing machine whereas the dishwasher\nHas this to sit through it and why can't you call the washing machine the clothes washing machine\n[laughter] right\nBecause it's it's usually either the washer the washing machine and very rarely do you do in the word closer laundry when you're talking about the device I think we can sort some of this out for you All right\nMore importantly to settle a bit of a disagree I may have had with my uh girlfriend here is it appropriate to call the clothes washing machine or is that not allowed\nOh are you both from Kentucky\nI Know we're both from Ohio originally we've been in Kentucky about two months now so we haven't quite picked up the way they speak here we both move around quite a bit I I had some time in Los Angeles she spent some time in Japan of all places or\nOh let's let's set the second part aside for now more than I Do like to interfere with marriages as much as we can\nShe got some time and get an of all places where a Clinton let's set that second part aside for now more than I Do like to interfere with marriages as much as we can [laughter] for\nThe kind of a linguistics at first the first thing you've got to understand is that the machine\nThe dish washing machine replaced people who are already known as dishwashers so we called the washing machine the dishwasher because the people who used to the job are also known as dishwashers there's a clear like very long separation between the people dishwasher and the machine dishwasher\nAnd actually you can see this happen with the word computer we have this divide on her desk now called the computer the people who used to do that kind of really complicated math\nWere also noted computer so this happens again and again an English where the machine that takes over the human job then get the human name so that's part of the reactors interesting yeah it's part of the reason why the dishwashers called the dishwasher\nThe other thing is that in washing machine that word washing referring to the task of cleaning clothes are doing the laundry is centuries old centuries older than any other kind of\nHow ... form of any word related to washing like we have long needed to launder are close and we have called them the washing or the laundry for very long time so Washington mean washing clothes has been in ... in specialized up the word that linguists use\nSpecial like this one particular kind of washing since the fourteen hundreds\nSo wow All right now because of washing when you say I'm On a Jew the washing most people probably would assume that you were in the U.S anyway would seem that you were talking about the laundry in the u._k. they might actually think that you met the dishes but he's really into\nThis thing and I think the other thing that's going on here too is that dishwashers weren't part as the everyday\nHousehold right in this country until about fifty right now and that that washing machines were little or will the word torture meaning machine dishwasher due to the Eighteen sixties right right but I mean in intimate right\nEveryday use of it you know you had industrial dishwashers or rational dishwashers All right so it really works on a kind of an order of events here which kind of use became more common sooner than the other ones that kind of\nTakes the mantle as the definitive meaning for that word and you find that again and again in English where\nSomething kind of wins out and so for example in the U. S. football one out at the meeting for American football\nAnd in the world football one out meaning soccer and just they become the defendant ... football although there have for centuries been many other kinds of football but if you'd say football people in their mind they think of the one specific more common kind of ... who are you are form so yeah\nSo have we preserved peace in your household I guess that's the bigger\n[laughter] I I think so but um are you able to call it a cold water or is that the ...\nWell yeah you can but why\nDid they just to be that there are cuts witness maybe there was no degree I think\nThe one who love the laundry and presses the button to call it whatever they said well you're doing the laundry you call it whenever you want them out she's doing whatever she wants\n[laughter] that thousands of buying a ticket and thanks for your call All right thank you bye\nBye bye good clean fun on this show eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three", "year": "2018", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "city": "Yuma", "day": "25", "locations": [["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Wisconsin", 44.50024, -90.00041], ["Wisconsin", 44.50024, -90.00041], ["New York New York New York New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Dallas", 32.78306, -96.80667], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["us", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["us", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["Moscow", 55.75222, 37.61556], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Panama City", 8.9936, -79.51973], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["moss moss", 59.43403, 10.65771], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Boulder Colorado", 40.01499, -105.27055], ["New Guinea", -5.0, 140.0], ["New York City", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Indianapolis Indiana", 39.76838, -86.15804], ["North Carolina", 18.38078, -65.95739], ["North Carolina", 18.38078, -65.95739], ["Iran", 32.0, 53.0], ["human county", 40.68472, -74.0025], ["Lexington Kentucky Kentucky", 37.98869, -84.47772], ["Ohio", 40.25034, -83.00018], ["Kentucky", 38.20042, -84.87762], ["Los Angeles", 34.05223, -118.24368], ["Japan", 35.68536, 139.75309], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["Yuma, AZ", 32.72532, -114.6244], "in_country": ["Arizona", "Washington", "Wisconsin", "Wisconsin", "New York New York New York New York", "Dallas", "Washington", "us", "us", "Washington", "Florida", "Florida", "Boulder Colorado", "New York City", "Indianapolis Indiana", "human county", "Lexington Kentucky Kentucky", "Ohio", "Kentucky", "Los Angeles", "Washington", "U.S"], "out_country": ["Moscow", "Panama City", "moss moss", "New Guinea", "North Carolina", "North Carolina", "Iran", "Japan"], "in_state": ["Arizona"], "out_state": ["Washington", "Wisconsin", "Wisconsin", "New York New York New York New York", "Dallas", "Washington", "us", "us", "Moscow", "Washington", "Panama City", "Florida", "moss moss", "Florida", "Boulder Colorado", "New Guinea", "New York City", "Indianapolis Indiana", "North Carolina", "North Carolina", "Iran", "human county", "Lexington Kentucky Kentucky", "Ohio", "Kentucky", "Los Angeles", "Japan", "Washington", "U.S"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KAWC", "content": "Cooperative approach to solving are critical environmental problems while we still can and to continue to fund furthering the values that contribute to a healthy planet\n\nDecember libraries celebrating teen read week with a big scandal conscious than the viewing of a film adaptation it's ongoing now through Saturday October Thirteen at the ... library which is located at Seventy five notes sixth avenue in families if you'd like more information you can contact us a nine to wait three or four seven six nine zero\nWhich is eighty eight point nine ... a double you'll see humor J.

know it actually thought of it is a term and then in in the hobbits\nCongressman logical for years and now in the street on a true\nYou know if I took a political recently the speaker of the work and it sent describing a some more [laughter] you know I don't know\nWhere you know this is happening\nOK okay this is good you've you've really hit some nights I'm mile markers on the progress in the inter relationships with a different kind of trolls that we have here let me see if I can add a few more a mile markers to kind of this map that you've got for troll\nFirst ... troll is ancient goes back to least old Norse in a variety of different forms referring to some mythological\nDescribing a somewhat more power to you know I don't know really you know this is happening\nOK okay this is good you've you've really hit some nights a mile markers on the progress in the inter relationships with a different kind of trolls that we have here let me see if I can add a few more a mile markers to kind of this map that you've got for troll\nFirst ... troll is ancient to go back to the least old Norse in a variety of different forms referring to some mythological creature often ugly often vaguely magical often I think that you didn't want to encounter\nThink of ah [noise] the the trolls and like a ... ... ... where there was a troll under the bridge or the ... yeah uh so did the troll goes way back but\nLeader and it's a separate instance of it and it has nothing to do with a mythological creature\nThe French came up with a troll meaning to bomb casts about\nOr to kind of scan for something or to slowly look for thing and we borrowed that troll into English and we use it primarily or did in fishing where you\nYou dangle debate over the side and your boat slowly goes down the tremor across the lake and you try to attract fish to slowly moving bait and you bring them and that's troubling\nAnd so we fast forward to the Internet I'm very early on in the history of the Internet it's a big social phenomena people started\nDoing what we now call trolling which is saying outrageous things\nSometimes that they didn't believe in order just to get a rise out of other people to get their goats so to speak or to just to buy their chops\nAnd missed trolling comes specifically from the fishing kind of ... which is you throw something outrageous out there on the Internet and see who bites maybe it's going to be a newbie who doesn't know that you're a big jokester maybe it's going to be somebody on the other side of the political spectrum who you just know it's going to be ... at the ... the thing that you said that you don't even really believe in\nBut obviously people know about the mythological so it's a very soon people who do trolling which comes from fishing were called trolls with the idea that they were\nUgly undesirable beast that I'm more causing all the mayhem and you didn't really want them around out that while yeah right [laughter] I think man the language borrows words don't stay themselves they they transform they modify and when we have\nSimilar words a lot of times the meanings intersect and we borrow from both streams in order to make a new stream\nWell that is absolutely fascinating I recognized that language my stomach I didn't expect this [laughter]\nYeah so the Internet trolling where you just say outrageous are dumb things on purpose in order to irritate her aggravate other people dates to at least the early Nineteen nineties a lot of times people will credit\nOf the news group ... urban but I've actually found it earlier than it's ever was ever mentioned in that news group in other places in using that in the in the news groups\nWell what's on cable TV with some regularity\nYes well it's mainstream now I'm not surprised that you heard it on cable news or ... feet on the news here is utterly mainstream because the Internet as mainstream movies we've been an Internet Society for going on Thirty years now\nRight and as you said the speaker of the house he is the term right it's it's striking to me that it goes from the fishing trolling idea\nBut also incorporates the they'd creepy guy under the bread yeah that's what I picture when I have Internet trolls you know I think if somebody coming out from the dark nether regions\nThere's this there's this incredible period there where they think this is important Harry the where the fishing trolling first became figurative and non fishing\nGoing on Thirty years now right and as you said the speaker of the house he is the term right it's it's striking to me that it goes from the fishing trolling idea\nBut also incorporates the they'd creepy guy under the bread yeah that's what I picture when I have Internet trolls you know I think somebody coming out from the dark nether regions\nWell there's this there's this ... period there where they think this is important to Harry to\nWhere the fishing trolling first became figurative and non fishing related in other ways\nBefore it arrived to the Internet idea of trolling so you can see people trolling for dates ... going to the mall and trolling for trouble\nOr trolling for information\nAnd there's another kind of correspondence here with the people that people often bring up which is trolling T. R. A. W. L. which is another kind of fishing we just throw it a wide net and see what comes in and so that further kind of pollutes our understanding of the origins of the term but fortunately this one has been fairly well research\nI find some new things every time I looked into it because new things digitized constantly\nAnd we have a pretty firm understanding of where this comes from now\nThank you very much Harry yeah thanks so much for calling but she ate it caused again sometime I Love your daycare much take care of things for the\nCall is eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three [noise]\nWe asked folks to tell us their terms for\nTaking a bath without really taking a band is sort of like a navy shower GI shower yeah yeah or just bash in your possible ... um we got a tweet from someone named true blue who said we call it ... not an entire bass Jesse important parts\nAlso leaving home without meeting and putting unclean closes called putting icing on gingerbread\n[laughter] icing on duty but I like that too okay I'm not quite sure didn't find by itself right yeah\nYeah but if you're putting the icing on you're putting on your clothes\nYeah [laughter] talk to us on Twitter WMA y W O R D hello you have a way with words\nYeah Hi this is Jeffrey calling from Gainesville, Florida\nJesse welcome thanks\nGrew up in northern Minnesota and there are there was this phrase that I heard and I haven't heard it anywhere else um and it was constructed like they would say oh for", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "11", "locations": [["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Mississippi", 32.75041, -89.75036], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Atlanta", 33.749, -84.38798], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Saudi Arabia's", 29.04234, 35.59259], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Washington DC", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Grand Rapids Michigan Michigan", 42.96336, -85.66809], ["Wisconsin", 44.50024, -90.00041], ["Australia", -25.0, 135.0], ["Tasmania", -42.0, 147.0], ["Alto", 18.35467, -66.00739], ["Barton", 38.47896, -98.75646], ["United kingdom", 54.75844, -2.69531], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["human county", 40.68472, -74.0025], ["Jesse", -17.98333, 29.3], ["Gainesville Florida", 29.65163, -82.32483], ["Jesse", -17.98333, 29.3], ["Minnesota", 46.25024, -94.25055]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["Yuma, AZ", 32.72532, -114.6244], "in_country": ["Arizona", "Washington", "Mississippi", "Atlanta", "Florida", "U.S", "U.S", "Washington", "Arizona", "Washington DC", "California", "U.S", "New York", "Washington", "America", "Grand Rapids Michigan Michigan", "Wisconsin", "Barton", "California", "human county", "Gainesville Florida", "Minnesota"], "out_country": ["Georgia", "Georgia", "Georgia", "Georgia", "Saudi Arabia's", "Australia", "Tasmania", "Alto", "United kingdom", "Jesse", "Jesse"], "in_state": ["Arizona", "Arizona"], "out_state": ["Washington", "Georgia", "Georgia", "Georgia", "Mississippi", "Georgia", "Atlanta", "Florida", "Saudi Arabia's", "U.S", "U.S", "Washington", "Washington DC", "California", "U.S", "New York", "Washington", "America", "Grand Rapids Michigan Michigan", "Wisconsin", "Australia", "Tasmania", "Alto", "Barton", "United kingdom", "California", "human county", "Jesse", "Gainesville Florida", "Jesse", "Minnesota"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KAWC", "content": "Human county library is hosting small business workshops presented by Andrew zoom in this week there'll be featuring find your customer will be this Friday afternoon from three to five at the human main library twenty nine fifty one twenty Bruce drive you can find further details you my library dot org\nBroadcasting from the property hardy radio studio complex on the campus of Arizona western college for more than forty five years this is K.

people a lot of men doing this for twenty costs here I've had several professional on personal experience it over the years where when I Am ...\nI'm from talking to start mouthing my word violently and it's sometimes distracting but it's also kind of intriguing look I'm Wondering if you're familiar with is is there a word for it anything can tell me about it\nAnd so are they listening with a particular intensity or they do they have a hearing\nThey're very focused now I've I've wondered maybe this helps them learn and help out and buy ...\nNow I work with that's with mental health background is an idea has something to do with my mother is up there now that have called me about something called ... which is a question of another person's word settled or not and I'm ... ...\n... very intensely and they will be losing my mouth\n... and look for mouthing what I'm finding\nThese our colleagues are clients clients [noise]\nUm you don't sound like a slow speaker to me that that you're speaking to slowly for them\nI don't get that than I Am I not contact persons sometimes that can be a ... okay good so I Wonder sometimes are they just not following that might be able to share it with complex or you know maybe at me\nBut it happened in enough different satellites that I I started to believe our pet but\nThere's gotta be some ... ... ... not enough people that do that mhm that this has gotta be something [laughter] whether it psychiatric disorder or a way for people to process information I have no clue and I couldn't find anything yeah when I started looking into that I Would\nSay dean dean on both of those ring the younger the youngest bell okay [laughter] being a little you know it's a pretty good guess I'm not an expert in this but as I understand that the clinical diagnosis doesn't require that they've ... the words and it can also be used to describe\nWhen they're anticipating your words or trying to see them at the same time or even when they repeat them just a fraction of a second after you save them\nSo but there's another word which is related which is\n... uh P. A. L. I. L. A. L. I. A. and this is when someone just repeats the last one or two words of what you're saying and again they can just mouths than to themselves they don't have to yeah vocal chords for three Powell yes\nSo you had one of those words and there's a second word but in general there's another theory here that I've read a little bit on again I'm not an expert in a clinical diagnoses for these kinds of speech behaviors\nBut his whole mirroring and the idea is that when you mirror someone else's actions including their speech and the shape and form of their words in their mouth you better understand what they're saying because like you can mirror somebody said tennis serve you\nCan move your arm in the same way and that can I help you understand how they successfully hit a ball in a difficult situation or yeah being a little more expert yourself and it's the same supposedly with the words that people are say so in a in an aspiration where someone has a hearing impairment or where\nWhen you mirror someone else's actions including their speech and the shape and form of their words in their mouth you better understand what they're saying because like you can mirror somebody said tennis serve\nYou can move your arm in that same way and that can I help you understand how they successfully hit a ball in a difficult situation or get yeah being a little more expert yourself and it's the same supposedly with the words that people are saying\nSo in a in a region where someone has a hearing impairment or where they're really just not getting the words repeating the words can help you have that second chance to re hear them but kind of in your own yeah\nYou know we were talking about diagnosis and and I think at the last thing you said grant makes a lot of sense to me that they're not necessarily a path I'll let you know mom I mean one of the listeners I Know on the planet does this and I think it's just her intent\nOf listening to another person she's she's very very present and she will do that\nStephanie women do this or they anticipate in your words they're trying to predict what you're about to say\nLike a final\nAnd how accurate do you think they are did they get the words are just kind of the lips kind of farm loosely moving along to what you're saying\nYou know honestly I'm trying to be cracker where ... ... can make a conquered them I'm not sure I can answer that because if I let it distract me then I'm not able to how I ended up that way possible\nMhm I Know what you're talking about I had a co worker and they do this and I'm trying to avoid pronouns and they would do full sentences of pretty much everyone they spoke to\nAnd their lips didn't match the words at all and it was like little worms ... on their face [laughter] very intelligent and very competent at their work and leave you know regular human being as far as I ever knew and and it was just I guess their way of understanding better\nAnd I'm sure there's a little bit of an under ... when I was young or one of my older brothers you quickly that Iran ... ... ... who were trying to rip out loud every word I had some sort of a little bit of that from my childhood that annoyed by there's\nOne more theory is worth considering and you might Google it to see what you can even look in your professional tax on this it invoke this idea that humans are constantly calculating the odds we are certainly in small ways in large ways trying to predict the future\nAnd from Jack in Caroline Raymond proud sponsors of wayward aimed at the nonprofit the producers and distributes this program\nI'm Jeremy hops an adult film actress Stormy Daniels told CNN about her first meeting with Donald Trump before he was president\nIs talking about yourself and on my work and I'm like so much to take that magazine in Spain\nAnd I'll never forget the look on his face [noise] I don't think I Would have stuck in that might not\nNow she's got a new book out the talks to us next time around here and\nJoin us for hearing now tomorrow morning from tend to noon Iran K.

[laughter] ... you know for a long time I've used the expression reading mortality your book mortality I think I Would use it on the show a couple of times and I may have learned it from her there was a piece in the Boston Globe many years ago but the idea is when you have that\nThat dawning moment that you're never going to get ... you want to read before you die yeah and I have a real me with the stock of books next to my bed which I think it's up to forty now oh yeah yeah yeah\nYeah and to just see them on the shelves it's it's like a memento Maury\nYeah I have to tell you my rule is they used to be a hundred pages and now it's instant like you have to impress me\nChapter one page one and you're not even fifty no I'm not even said I Will tell you why because I give a lot of books that chance based on recommendations and people have terrible [laughter] I mean though that's obviously just a joke but the truth is that it takes me a while to figure out who in my world\nReally has taste like made so my will try books that somebody recommend hoping they're they're my literary ... anger and that what they like I like so I get a lot of books\nThat on uh uh yeah this is terrible and this person does not match me in their tastes and inclinations would be really interested to know what our listeners have to say about that you're given the call eat seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three tell us when do you give up on a book\nOr as an author a novelist what kind of shop should people be giving you should we give you a chapter two ten eight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven through your email words that we would radio dot\nHoping they're they're my literary ... and that what they like I like so I get a lot of books that I don't uh uh yeah this is terrible and this person does not match me and their tastes and inclinations\nWould be really interested to know what our listeners have to say about that\nYou give us a call eat seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three tell us when to give up on a book or asthma and author a novelist what kind of shop should people be giving you should we give you a chapter two ten eight seven seven Ninety nine Ninety six seven through your email words that we would radio dot org although we have a way with words\nHey this is even I'm calling from Maryland\nI even we're in Maryland are you I'm In Baltimore in Baltimore okay welcome to show would you mind Steven\nI have moved around a lot and for part of my life I Lived in Nevada and once I left Nevada nobody said now that [noise]\nSo what I mean when I moved to North Carolina kids on the bus would call it Nevada and I have gotten and many high because of\nBecause you know I was from Nevada and I knew the way it was supposed to be pronounced and seems like everyone else in the world as Nevada so I was wondering I Hope I'm not wrong but is it possible that I'm thinking correctly or the world wrong [laughter]\nAre you saying that you got in Fitz fights on the bus because they mispronounce Nevada\nNever as I Know still haven't been in one of those in my life I'm no just more a me kind of screaming at kindergarten for mispronouncing [laughter] just pronouncing the state I don't know why it offended me so much but it it truly did\nWhen you were screaming a kindergarten you were also gender Gardner writes\nWe can do with that\n[laughter] imagining a high schooler shouting I knew when I was [laughter]\nI I was probably like second grade and a really felt like I had to defend Nevada from being called in Nevada\nYeah right ... where you can tell people that if you're in that state that's how you should be pronouncing it sure day I grew up in Kentucky and I have to confess that I pronounced it like your friends in North Carolina\nNevada I never knew anything different until just a few years ago and now I'm training myself just seeing the van and because I run into so many people from that state who are very very insistent that it's in a in fact I think the Nevada\nTourism authority so little and the one I rented yeah hey yeah in some in some of their materials they won that word to get out there in Nevada\nNow my story is even worse I grew up in Missouri and there's a town that spelled the same but it is pronounced ... Vita so for me the state was paid for very long time because that's how you pronounce the talent Missouri well not so sure there are people from other states have a similar problem people from Hawaii\nUm most of the country doesn't see it with that stop in there\nAnd people from Oregon uh bits not Oregon or or ... you know it's Oregon ... ready to die I ... I was thinking about that yeah they have the same problem and tons of local place names luck you're never going to correct everyone on this [laughter] you might just hold on to like secret knowledge like a magic spelled you have and they don't just\nBecause you might just find a way to relax and just enjoy the fact that they're talking about a steep that you love and tell them really wonderful things about Nevada since they came up\nUm I guess I can let it slide but uh it's good to know that you know in the in the context of the state that I'm correct\nYeah yeah you are correct and everyone in Nevada like cheering now [laughter] ... thank you for your call where we're with you on this you've got the right pronunciation I Would try to pick your battles and don't fight kindergarten nurse stock that [laughter] but otherwise good on yeah All right\nFind a way to relax and just enjoy the fact that they're talking about the state that you love and tell them really wonderful things about Nevada since they came up\nUm I guess I can let it slide but uh it's good to know that you know and that and the other states that I'm correct\nYeah yeah you are correct and everyone in Nevada like cheering now [laughter]\n... thank you for your call where we're with you on this you've got the right pronunciation I Would try to pick your battles and don't fight kindergarten nurse stopped that [laughter] but otherwise good on yeah All right [laughter] very month I think Steven by by\nEight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\nAlthough it will come away with words Hi\nThis is Brad calling from South central PA\nSouth central PA welcome to the show\nWhat are you thinking about linguistically today\nI work at a trailer shop with a bunch of mechanics and I've noticed that a few of them is an expression like if you want it to get twenty seven screws it say twenty couple [noise]\nAnd um I had a cat or anywhere else before and I asked them about it and nobody seems to know where it came from so I thought I'd ask you that\nInteresting and are they all from that same part of the country\n[noise] I think so mhm\n[noise] so instead of twenty seven they would say twenty capital\nAnd would that be\nThe same for twenty three twenty five [noise]\nSo it's kind of like saying twenty or twenty I was OK yeah some odd cents in Somalia yeah what's really interesting I think you might have found what I Would call them on polished diamond here um because if you did go round on this term I can find no slaying dictionary or dialect dictionary or\nAny linguistic research that has touched upon the idea of using couple attached to a number in this way to represent some unknown quantity I mean obviously obviously couple on its own can sometimes being two three or even for but it attaching it in its way to uh numbers really unusual\nWhen I look at the top on the Internet and newspapers and discussion forums I find that looks like a nice tight circle\nOf usage in places like Maryland Virginia York, PA and he's very PA and Winston Salem North Carolina Winston Salem is kind of the outlier here but you could draw a kind of odd shaped oval around all the cities which might suggest that there's a geographic\nNature to it I Need a lot more data to prove that so it's if I had the time I Would be spending a couple of days trying to figure this one I think you found something they fear a couple of days really interesting\nYeah yeah [laughter] yeah I Would really well established is the term couple three mhm which yeah which is just kind of across the United states north couple three meaning a few meaning someplace between two and four it's it's odd", "year": "2018", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "city": "Yuma", "day": "04", "locations": [["Arizona",
