tropes like quiet as a most dumb as an ox and that sneaky weasel\nRight that's right if I had an elephant's memory I could do better than say bloodthirsty batter brave it's a lion but enough monkey around the point is we make easy assumptions about animals based on their appearance or some aspect of their behavior\nPeople think that because that somehow evolutionary redundant Annette rubbish about sex and the reason why people think that rubbish it because they don't procreate while in zoos but actually getting animal to breathe in captivity is incredibly hard\nBut you know old animals

just live in a different world they inhabit a different universe is that really true\nYeah yeah I think that's a great quote we see well we have well often there's not as I K but different animals

it's an important point the one that was made that\nIf we think an animal is gross they're dumb or we have some reason to recoil from it we might not be motivated to care about that animal and a conservative habitat for example in the case of the vulture\nAnd more than that we don't understand why they're doing it I mean the animals are not deliberately being gross or anything like that that's their lifestyle and there's got to be a reason for it because otherwise we wouldn't be around doing it so we've got to resist the temptation to you know consider their behavior in the same

than four times the human population of Louisiana are swimming scurrying and eating the way through the fragile coastal wetlands of the Mississippi Delta\nAnd there are a problem not just in the

I don't feel that when I look at termites\nAnts move in a very a sort of ... by the jagged did weigh termites flow and to me they're not as disturbing to actually watch\nAnd then the second thing is I Would say termites have an extraordinary aesthetic\nWhen they're building a mound that can be say Fifteen feet tall [noise]\nThey feel inside of it with their antennas defined rough areas and wherever it's rough they pull away the dirt until it's smooth and so when you open up a termite mound it's this extraordinary world with these very smooth beautiful\nInterior spaces and I think if you look closely enough at termites they become quite beautiful\nNow when they're making their their mound what are they making them out of and what is the material that results\nLook different termites build in different environments so the termites that I watched for the longest time we're not going to turn ... and they were in Namibia and they build with little balls of mud which they making their mouths and the mud is\nSomewhat cemented with some kind of special termites saliva\nAnd we don't know exactly how they built but a basic description of it is that one tour might will put down one dirt ball and another term might will put down another dirt ball on top of that and then they keep piling up the dirt ball until they have like little peaks\nAnd then those little peaks kind of connect to make for the little walls\nAnd then those walls some of them have arches in them they begin to build up and one of the things that we know drives them is the smell of fresh air inside their mound it smells really intensely of termites smells really intensely a fungus\nAnd of course there's all this feces and they're constantly transferring microbial sort of starter culture to each other by mouth to mouth and melted but [noise]\nSo there's this intense smell in there and when any fresh air comes through some termites run from the fresh air into the mound and set off alarm a sort of a ... they they make a sound and then other termites grab a dirt ball they build and build until they've cut off the fresh air smell\nSo just to be clear the fresh air it's not something they're drawn to the way that we are when we want to step out of our buildings and get some fresh air the fresh air suggests that there may be holes are vulnerabilities in their defense system\nYes if you're termite you're constantly being attacked by aunts and aunt eaters an art barks an art wolves and anything else that can hack their way into your\nInto your mound so one of the things that you do if you're a termite is you you know how to control your perimeter and the way that they do that is that when they smell fresh air they know they need to go do something", "show_name": "Big Picture Science", "year":

if it does I'm going to finish that don't [noise]\nI'm ...\nI'm Molly Bentley welcome to the big picture science produced at the SETI Institute where researchers investigate the nature and the origin of life and they picture science we give you the wide angle view and science and technology\nHeredity was once understood to be straightforward genes were passed from parents to offspring and you were blessed or stuck with a lot you got\nDNA did not change over a lifetime well now we know that isn't true your environmental exposures and lifestyle influence the chemical switches that govern your DNA is behavior moreover powerful gene editing tools lettuce tinker with genes directly\nEditing them or adding new ones and they may be evidence in both cases that one generations genetic alterations can be inherited by the next and this episode the scientists at the genetics NASA's astronaut twin study editing the mosquito genomes to prevent malaria\nAnd how all these challenges are traditional concept of heredity its DNA is not destiny\n[noise]\nWe have two stories each from an unusual laboratory where experiments in genetic modification are testing our old notion that DNA is destiny the second will come later in the show but we can tell you that both labs\nShare something in common there secured with air locks the first air lock as necessary because there is no air and space [noise]\nAll the air lock the doors to the international space station that allows you to go\nOutside into space and hopefully back inside because it could make it back inside\nStation that allows you to go\nOutside into space and hopefully back inside because it could make it back inside the really bad I this is Scott Kelly I'm a former NASA astronaut than US Navy fighter pilot test pilot\nCaptain county was on the international space station for about a year during which time something funny happened to his DNA and we know that because scientists compared Scott's DNA with that as identical twin brother mark on earth the results of this NASA twin study revealed the workings of at the genetics\nWe had talked about ... percent of the genes that had changed expression\nDid not yet returned back to normal and so ah unfortunately a couple of media outlets picked it up and just said seven percent of his games were lost as this seven percent of his DNA had changed and keeping in mind that between us insurance to really just a you know one percent and other species just a handful of present so the last seven percent of the genes or DNA\nIt'd be a different species right so um some of those reports were definitely wrong and that just set the record straight it became a great teachable moment of what is the difference between a gene being president or being expressed\nSome of those reports were definitely wrong in the desert the record straight it became a great teachable moment of what is the difference between a gene being president or being expressed since obviously the expression of the gene is like the when you read the book of life\nIs what is really active form of genetic code versus just losing a whole page from your book of life which is what kind of some of the headlines looked like for a little while they're really exciting thing though is that we know of a shortlist ... to keep an eye on for future astronaut that seemed to change when you're up there and and don't go back right away\nYou know if he'd come back a different species have if he went up a man and and and came back a turtle I mean that would have been you know dismaying for his wife I Would I Would think yeah yeah he would you know we get less applicants to the astronaut program in Christopher Mason thanks very much for speaking with us great thank you my pleasure\nChristopher Mason is an associate professor of genetics in computational biology at Weill Cornell medicine and now a decidedly earth bound astronaut reaction to being a lab rat in space\nScott it sounds like a year in some sort of conveying it's are you in a car somewhere\nI'm In a spaceship going to Mars [laughter] no actually\nI'm In a suburban heading to the island Ga I Wish there was [laughter]\nNow when you came back to earth and you heard about these epigenetic changes what was your reaction to hearing about that stuff\nYeah I don't know you know it's it's something that you know is not symptomatic\nI Can't feel it [noise] I think interesting information for me\nAnd what about the telomeres because unlike what normally happens you know as you get older your telomeres shorten you know did you did you notice that at least that you say wow I feel Twenty years younger or something [noise]\n[noise] no but uh you know my telomeres apparently it's got a better but you know within a couple of months after I got on the back where they were previously not about you\nBut that's disappointing well finally than Scott you know you come back to earth and at least for a while that some of your DNA has been altered did you feel like you didn't have an identical twin during that period\nI Hope so but when I see him in her city works somewhat similar me so I guess not\n[laughter] well Scott thanks very much\nAll right take care of\nCaptain Scott Kelly is a former military test pilot and astronaut what fascinates you about this study\nWell I think it's interesting to me simply because of the immediate applicability to the human exploration of the solar system I mean you know we we we go to Mars we go to the moons of Jupiter we go all over the solar system every night on my TV\nBut one of the big unknowns is how good an idea is that is that going to affect the health of the crew members in ways that we haven't yet learned about so you know this this study bears on that TV show are you watching that travel all over the\nSolar system just about any ... show on the air and there always are plenty of them [noise] Mm\nWell it's wild stuff but as we heard the changes to astronaut Scott Kelly's DNA were mostly reversed after he spent time on earth\nThey stuck around\nThe story gets even weirder with each passing the epigenetic changes can be inherited in other words\nThe consequences of behavior could be passed down to the next generation hits\nThe in is not destiny on big picture science [noise]\nWell John thank her my downtime they're not actually getting hit by a bird and cook o'clock and by that and you're wondering why we say walk someone someone\nWhy did they did that you know I Do not so great you're having a nurture joined us this week for a way

ended up information on events community members outdoor activities and attributes unique to humans southwest living can be found at living in Yuma dot com\n[noise]\n\nThe results of the NASA twin study hard only relevant to astronauts there yet more evidence that everyone's DNA is subject to sometimes dramatic a modification by our environment Scott Kelly's DNA\nReverted to his pre flight chemistry when he returned to earth and it's our understanding that epigenetic changes accumulated over a lifetime are erased the four genes are passed to a new generation\nBut we aren't certain of that research on non human species suggests that at least some of the changes can be passed down\nReporter Carl Zimmer whose latest book is on the science of heredity describes those studies and what the NASA twin studies says and does it say about changes do astronaut Scott Kelly's DNA\nYeah so what is happening in a study like that is that the actual a sequence of letters and Scott's genes is not being rewritten by being in space\nBut when scientists look at his cells before and after and compare them to his brother marks they can see that there are epigenetic differences they can see that the pattern of molecules around his DNA\nSeems to be different in some regards than it was before now\nIn some cases and then maybe it would be in the case of Scott's if some genes are turned on and they're turned off due to environmental factors could those changes in those genes or the activation or the dorm at state of those genes be passed on to another generation\nAh well that is a very big controversy I'm so this is something called a trans generational epigenetic inheritance nice big craze and so the idea there is that an experience that a person or some other species has\nAlters the upper genetics and their cells that includes germ cells in other words egg and sperm that that can then produce the next generation and that next generation the idea goes can inherit the epigenetic changes along with the genes\nAnd so there are lots of really good compelling examples in nature that this can indeed happened uh they just don't really include humans can you give us an example of how it might happen sure so let's say there's a plant\nAnd mining its own business and it gets attacked by\nThey include humans can you give us an example of how it might happen sure so let's say there's a plant and mining its own business and it gets attacked by some insects\nSo plants switch on a bunch of genes when they sense this sort of attack and they produce a bunch of chemicals that the hope is quote unquote to drive off the insects or at least sort of minimize their attack\nPlants that experience an attack from insects or or pathogens they will produce seeds and if the windows seeds grow into new plants they will actually respond faster to these kinds of attacks than they would have otherwise like they have a memory yeah\nAnd the same is true of the seeds that you produce from those plants um and so you that seems to go through several generations with plants\nWell here's a blue sky question you're ready actually it's higher than blue skies [laughter] at the [noise]\nThe orbit of the international space station let's say that Scott had fathered a child in space when he was his molecules are undergoing these changes is it possible that anything that has changed in ... we say is DNA did not change that any of these epigenetic factors could have been passed down to this child\nThere is no evidence from humans that it could have and part of that reason for that is that it seems that plant biology and animal biology are very different and the way that epigenetics is controlled in those kinds of organisms is different\nAnd so in humans during that process of an embryo developing producing its own eggs or sperm\nA lot of those epigenetic marks that may have accumulated in one's lifetime get stripped away in those cells and then a third of a baseline set of epigenetic marks or put back in place\nNow exactly how it works we don't know but we do know that if you exercise a lot they will modify the DNA in your muscles and actually change expression of genes and principals so you might get stronger and live longer\nI I can understand how exercise might modify the condition of my muscles their tone whatever but the DNA I mean does that get passed on or is that in DNA that will never make it to the next generation\nThey will not make it to the next generation in that particular case as far as we know now turns out though that nutrition probably affects your DNA and can pass on\nIn some ways that we don't fully understand that as an example when in the city of St Petersburg during World War two lots of people starved\nAnd actually people came out short for generations after that and there are other examples of this was well that's thought to happen by DNA modification and in fact there's one other interesting example I can tell you about which is in Guyana you can actually look at\nWhen kids are conceived not when they're born but when they're ... which is nine months before when they're born\nAnd it turns out that kids conceived in the rainy season\nCome out different in height and build than those in the dry season those in the dry season the parents are better nutrition the mom in particular\nAnd so the kids come out a little bit healthier and a little bit bigger and it's also the case they have differences in their modify DNA so that as I say nutrition actually does affect the modification of your DNA now exactly how that makes you bigger and a healthier we don't understand and that's thought to be able to pass and to next generations\nI gotta say this is astounding because this this this sounds like I don't know the marquee and evolution this sounds like the stories you know that they believed a two hundred years ago that giraffes just stretch their next a little bit and so baby giraffes have longer next I mean I thought that that was long gone that idea\nWell I I think most of the more permanent things giraffes probably are genetically controlled or or how much has influenced by a genetics isn't fully understood but it is clear there are epigenetic in fact most of them don't pass generation or so it's thought we don't fully understand very active area of research\nBut it's pretty clear the epigenetic does affect you I mean you and now it turns out that believe it or not as you age or DNA modifies as well in fact you can tell how old someone is from the modifications in their DNA\nMy goodness All right well don't look in mind set\nBy the way that does not pass the next generation some modifications in your DNA that are are associated with your age they will not pass them to the next generation that clock reset so when you start out as a baby you are baby\nI say you don't get boring as a as an old cod jerk [laughter] no no not at all you know we talk about controlling future generations by modifying DNA and I mean this has been kept to wait and then the term designer babies and I think a lot of people would go for that if it wasn't\nTrolling future generations by modifying DNA I mean this isn't kept elated and the term designer babies and I think a lot of people would go for that if it wasn't too expensive I don't know but this sounds like you could do things by you know just modify your diet and maybe your kids live I don't know more musical talent I mean is that truly does it go that far\nYeah that's not so clear I mean again it's a very poorly understood area and that's why a lot of people are working on it it's very very clear that the nutrition on other health of a pregnant mom\nHas a huge influence on the unborn fetus so that she pregnant women need to take care of themselves obviously hear how they shouldn't smoke and drink alcohol those are very very real effect now to what extent they wind up modifying the DNA\nOf the fetus is not so clear but it is very likely that is the case so I Would argue that that's a huge and very important developmental time\nAnd in fact there's an area called preterm birth babies are born to early can have significant health problems and and that often happens because of issues associated with environment so pregnant women who live in poor areas have a much higher incidence of preterm birth\nAnd it's not because they're not necessarily giving good nutrition and such to their kids\nThe child will not develop properly and and maybe get worn early and that does have serious health consequences\nAnd so it's plausible we don't know for sure but it seems very likely that some of that will be at the genetic then those kids that are born earlier could modify DNA that's a little bit different than those of others so environment does have a big effect\nMichael Snyder thanks very much for speaking with us\nThanks for having me here\nMichael Snyder is the chair of the genetics

the other in Southern California was visited by reporter Carl Zimmer\nSo one day I went to visit a biologist name Anthony James he works at the University of California Irvine and we went down to the basement and put on surgical gowns\nThen he opens up this door into this small room he closes the door behind them\nAnd we're actually basically in an air lock he turned to an inner door opens that one up and we go into his lab which is an insect tearing up as a place where he raises thousands of mosquitoes\nThe lab is abuzz with research because while a mosquito may look non threatening I mean it's small enough to purge on a finger nail no insect species has been a more efficient killer for one they carry malaria a disease that deals death hundreds of thousands of people a year mostly children\nThe gamble at the University of California Irvine inserted gene into a mosquito that will stop its deadly parasite passenger and then release those genetically modified insects into the wild the gene editing technique CRISPR allows for these precise in rapid edits which when combined with gene drives\nGreatly increases the chances that the genetic modification are inherited again and again\nCarl Zimmer's visit to Anthony James insect Terry I'm was part of the research for his latest book she has her mother's laugh and the powers perversion some potential of heredity hit explores among other things how having the power to change genes directly challenges are traditional notions of heredity\nCarl can you describe but it was like to be inside this in sectarian where the mosquitoes bussing all around you how close did you get to them\nSo you know this is not a place where you're just like in one gigantic cloud of mosquitoes of it it would be very hard to do research and to breathe these mosquitoes or they're just going around willy nilly they're managed at each stage of their life cycle\nSo when they're when they're larvae um swimming around in water which is what ... does do and so they're in these little Tupperware tubs that are sealed and they're off in their own room and once they have developed into um the adults with wings\nThen they're put in jars where the males and females mate\nAnd then the females than need to drink blood and so they get transferred to of all things these movie popcorn tubs\nWhere James and his colleagues stick this little container of warm blood on top of the lid and then the mosquitoes are underneath served sticking their\nLittle ah mouth parts through a membrane to drink the blood so they're all sort of hanging upside down feeding on blood it's quite bizarre\nIt's a good luck for the mosquitoes 'cause they get free refills on those that's right that's right as much blood is you can handle and then and then once they're ready to lay eggs than they are transferred into a dark room because female mosquitoes like to be in the dark when they lay their eggs\nAnd they put in other jars and then um they lay their eggs there and then they die and the scientists extract these little strips of eggs which they then take to insert DNA into it does have a little creepy factor you know the cow's blood", "year":

this episode wonder women\n[noise]\nHere through belly an American biochemist once said I hadn't been aware that there were doors close to me until I started knocking on them Dr alien was born in Nineteen Eighteen and knocked out a lot of doors on the way to winning her Nobel Prize\nIn Nineteen eighty eight it's a familiar tale for any woman who was pursued a career in science\nAstronomer Jill Tarter also pounded on a lot of doors on her way to becoming a pioneer in her field as a young girl she had a nonstop curiosity about technology but growing up in the Nineteen fifties she found scant encouragement for these interests she kept knocking on doors anyway\nThe gender symmetry didn't change much when she went to college Dr charter was the only woman in an engineering class of three hundred and went on to become one of the few females working in astronomy and eventually the field of set the the search for extraterrestrial intelligence\nTo go out to the professor for an extension so we all we're trying to figure out a way to use my uniqueness to our best advantage\nThat if we fast forward later on in your career on you may have been able to leverage it in other ways and also I Wonder if when you heard the term so you're looking for a little green men\nI mean I've seen you wrote I don't know if I've actually seen you roll your eyes at that I've seen a squid like you are now um but that is also something I think that you have used here at advantage because you've turned it on its head\nYes certainly so when we started the study project within NASA when John Billingham started the project [noise]\nThe first thing we had to do was to build credibility and get beyond the UFO or little green men kind of connotations and I would walk into a room\nEither scientific colleagues or congressional staffers and a members of Congress themselves\nAnd because of the cultural norm they don't expect a woman to start talking about specifications and the details of the engineering and it was suddenly oh gee didn't expect to hear that maybe we should listen to her\nSo by simply showing and showing off some times that I was a lot smarter than they were with respect to the field that I was working in I could gain attention and I did for whatever it took\nThe question is always implied with you but I'll just ask it straight out since you've been doing this for a long time are we alone in the universe\nAre we alone I don't know the answer the question I'm that's why we're doing study that's why we're doing experiments observations to try and find out the answer\nShowing and showing off some time that I was a lot smarter than they were with respect to the field that I was working in I could gain attention and I did for whatever it took\nThe question is

we're doing study that's why we're doing experiments observations to try and find out the answer when I was a student we knew\nLife at least intelligent technology logical life\nCouldn't live in very extreme environments had to be between the boiling and freezing points of water had to be neutral could be very acidic or very basic\nAnd that's all know exploded now that we've been studying extremophiles I mean who would've expected to find life kilometers down into the crust which we do live finds a way in all kinds of environment like find a way and so that's the story over my career has been\nThat the universe has appeared to be more bio friendly than when I started out it doesn't mean it is we haven't proven that that appearances actually translate into reality but I think we will in this century\nWell and and finally Jill I'm what does it mean that you have not found aliens so far in terms of how you sustain yourself psychologically in other words what's it like to work on a program that you may never have an answer for it\n[noise] when I started in this exploration I think I understood fairly well how big a question it was that I was trying to answer on that I might not find an answer\nBy the end of my life but it might be my granddaughter or her granddaughter that eventually succeeds Jill Tarter thank you so much for joining us today oh Molly it's been a

at Rio de surveys the dot com\nOne of the barriers to women pursuing careers in science and technology is a climate that is subtly unwelcome or worse\nUs men and women and space science and astronomy has been in the news and gotten our attention but some researchers suspected that was more to the story as big as it was\nThey wanted to quantify other alarming anecdotes that they were hearing associate professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois captain Clancy and colleagues surveyed more than four hundred astronomers and planetary scientists with questions of their experience in the workplace over the last five years but this survey was unique\nWe focused our attention on the experiences of women of color because women of color if it's a double bind and we wanted to see the extent to which we could see that in the sciences\nThe researchers asked the women about eight different issues related to identity gender gender identity race sexuality physical ability mental ability narrow diversity that is variations in neurological conditions and religion\nAnd we out to the extent to which they had overheard disparaging remarks about these kinds of identities to the extent to which that they had experienced verbal and physical harassment as a result of these identities\nAnd then whether or not they'd ever felt unsafe in their workplace and finally whether or not they'd ever skipped professional event due to feeling unsafe\nThe result was the paper coauthored by Dr Clancy double jeopardy in astronomy and planetary science women of color face greater risks of gender and racial harassment published in the summer of twenty Seventeen in the journal of geophysical research planets\nThe results may have been given less attention at the time and they deserved because they were published in a niche journal but the implications are as broad as they are sobering\nOur main findings where is that women of color experienced a the greatest degrees of verbal and physical harassment even more so than white women that they felt unsafe in their workplace in extraordinarily high numbers\nForty percent of the women of color in our sample so that they felt unsafe in the workplace as a result of their gender and you know that was a really devastating them for us and then of course a number of women or women of color and white women reported that they skipped professional events because they felt unsafe what\nWas your reaction to the results of your survey and from one account I read that you were devastated and I wonder if you could expand on that because women and women of color have reported this sort of behavior for a long time so should the survey results couldn't have come as a complete surprise no\nUm I mean the thing is is that none of this work that I've been doing for the last five years has ever surprise me you know it's not that a single time I've seen data and been like oh\nI had no idea that women of color were going to experience and greater degree uses harassment\nUm instead what I think it is as there's there's something about hearing anecdotes and having your heartbroken by having a friend tell you that something happened to them\nBut it's another thing altogether to have those strung together into a quantitative story you know one that says that this isn't just a one off this is actually a systemic problem\nNow in in your survey and as you just said forty percent of women of color reported that they felt unsafe how do you define that term that's an alarming word to feel unsafe how did you define it we didn't define it we\nSpeaking about hearing anecdotes and having your heartbroken by having a friend tell you that something happened to them but it's another thing altogether to have those strung together into a quantitative story you know one that says that this isn't just a one off this is actually a systemic problem\nNow in in your survey and as you just said forty percent of women of color reported that they felt unsafe how do you define that term that's an alarming word to feel unsafe how did you define it\nWe didn't define it we just ask them to what you know have you ever felt unsafe in your workplace and have you ever skipped any professional events because you felt unsafe and so that certainly leaves it open for responding to interpret that term however they like\nYou know the way I might interpret it might be different from the way you read it but either way I think it's going to be a pretty negative workplace experience if you could ever label what you're experiencing is unsafe\nYou use the term in your abstract micro aggressions and I wonder if you distinguish between micro aggressions that one experiences in the workplace and a blunt hostile remark an actual physical aggression\nSo micro aggressions are really about different types of incivility\nOr unpleasant interactions you may have in the workplace that are clearly a result of your identity and usually specifically a result of your race that's really where the term I Believe originally came from his understanding racial micro aggressions so someone might say something that I'm very subtly racially motivated\nLike making a comment about oh how often do you actually wash your hair\nTo an African American person or a or I'll actually I'll tell you one that I I Know happened here on my campus because uh a lecturer told me about an a student of her telling her about it is that uh there was this one African American woman and a lecture hall she was one of the only African American women in the entire chemistry class\nAnd she could hear a couple of white men behind her giggling\nAnd couldn't figure out why and then at the end of the class realize they had stuck a pen in her hair [noise]\nUm you know she had sort of an afro and it was a a department of chemistry Penn\nSo it was like a let's make it as obvious as possible that you are not welcome here that we find something other end and weird about you\nWas heartbreaking truly in and you identified this was reading that I'm Eighteen percent of women of color and twelve percent of women\nJust skipped out on a professional meetings on seminars and other events that they would otherwise go to because they wanted to avoid this hostile climate that it's so bad that you [laughter]\nThat you avoid doing the thing that you love and participating in your field and and collaborating with your your colleagues because you don't know how you're going to be treated in that meeting\nOh exactly and you don't want to be reminded of you know the person who made a pass at you at lunch or the person who made you feel smaller made you feel stupid so you miss out on that seminar you miss out on the chance to\nMeet you know the senior colleague who does the work that you do um or chance to bond with some of your friends or or a chance to just learn something new and exciting you know [noise]\nUm and so you know what that means though if they miss out on that networking\nThat I'm can help them be seen as a quote team player or help them meet the right person who helps them with a promotion I'm One of the things I was really struck by when conducting interviews for this project which we hope will go into a a leader publication\nIs that a number of the respondents and not just women of color but women of color white women white men men of color um there were all represented in our sample many of them said oh I started out in physics but I left physics to go to\nUm and so you know what that means though if they miss out on that networking\nThat I'm can help them be seen as a quote team player or help them meet the right person who helps them with a promotion I'm One of the things I was really struck by when conducting interviews for this project which we hope will go into a a leader publication\nIs that a number of the respondents and not just women of color but women of color white women white men men of color um there were all represented in our sample many of them said oh I started out in physics but I left physics to go to John and me because I Want it to be in a less hostile discipline\nAnd so I mean that makes me think that physics might actually be even worse than astronomy in terms of\nHow hostile it is or just how intimidating that workplace can feel workplace aggression and sexual harassment in the workplace or not new but you found that people did not expect to find them present in the sciences as well and why would people think\nThat the science is would be immune to aggression and sexual harassment\nShort and this is one of the things that I find\nFrustrating sometimes in fact as someone who's both a ... a social scientist and a trained like scientists because I'm a biological anthropology is um some always surprised when I encountered scientists from other disciplines\nWho are incredibly staunch believers that science is a meritocracy that the best people who do science are the ones who stay in science and they're the ones who succeed in science they're the ones who get the best papers and the best funding\nAnd they just couldn't be further from the truth I mean what really matters in science is your pedigree what matters unfortunately is often your identity\nOr the number of African American female post docs that I've known over the last five to seven years\nWho um end up on every shortlist that they go up you know when they go up for jobs and then are always there's always a white man chosen over them and it's always they're always told afterwards oh well you interviewed really well but this other person was just a better fit for our department\nYou know these are extraordinary scientists that I'm Talking about who aren't getting these jobs so it's not that they're not good enough right they're getting the interviews\nI really think that scientists have to start paying closer attention to issues of implicit

platforms glowing with celebrity ... such and that his spouse by model actress an anti vaccine activists Jenny McCarthy but here's the thing since we're urged to be our own health advocates and to seek second opinions why not outsource to Hollywood\nWhy not follow the advice of the photogenic I mean pearly smiles million dollar mansions things seem to be working out for them\nPaul Offit is a professor of pediatrics at the children's hospital of Philadelphia and the ... school of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania his wry responses in the title of his latest book\nThat advice or why celebrities politicians and activists aren't your best source of health information however he does explain why we're tempted to follow them\nAll I'd like to begin by simply asking you the very question that's posed by the subtitle of your book why would celebrities or politicians are activists be anyone's best source of health information\nWell I think in part because we think we know them you know celebrities are people that we see on the big screen or little screen the same thing's true politicians and I think at some level because they've been given a platform they have influence I mean you you look at who is ...\nSee on the big screen or little screen the same thing's true politicians and I think at some level because they've been given a platform they have influence I mean you you look at who is used to sell products invariably it celebrities because people think that they know them I mean they don't pick experts on that particular product to sell them and they pick celebrities\nAll right so we feel that we know them and consequently we should listen to them it's sort of like your next door neighbor I mean if they were telling you you know something that might be relevant to your health would you listen to them if they you know they weren't actually medical doctors\nYes that's exactly what people do listen to them because they trust them whereas the doctor or the clinician is seen as somebody a little more distant more formal part of the medical industrial complex and so\nPeople are a little more turned off by them I especially these days you know you go to a doctor's office the doctor said there's there's it's a computer screen types in your information often doesn't look at you it's distancing whereas your neighbors your friends are going to give you information that helps you\nOut if it doesn't well now let's follow up a little bit on that because when a politician she was written up in the New York times actually it was a big big story about her company group that started out as a website for health and lifestyle advice and then it has grown into a multibillion dollar company\nIt's gotten a lot of criticism for making health and wellness claims that are not supported by science and that seems to have only increased the business\nWhat it is it about going to ... given the health advice\nYou I'm not so sure it's her specifically as as much as what she's offering she's offering magic she's offering these wonderful magical cures if you have an auto immune disorder for which medicine offers little or appears to offer little she has magic glasses or\nYou know magic rubs that can make you better I mean this is not new I think for centuries we've been very much drawn in by snake oil salesmen she's just a modern day ... salesman\nWell given an example of bad health advice and possibly also an example of it being consequential\nShe argues that if you want to bounce you're uterine hormones that what you should do is you should have vegetables steaming with McGuire it I'm\n... steaming is not a good idea it can cause burns and serious infections are aside from the fact that it's never going to get into your uterus and my word is in a hormone it's terrible advice and then in addition she recently or not so recently has talked about\nJade eggs that one and search that into The Vagina in order to induce a better muscle tone but if you have foreign bodies sitting in your ... periods of time you can have bacterial over both especially with bacteria that cause\nSo called toxic shock center that's what happened with those super absorb and tampons a couple of decades ago when we had an outbreaks of a toxic shot sooner because of that recommendation\nBut in New York Times magazine piece it said that ... has given into pressure\nAnd says the company will hire a fact checker um so you know that her claims about I don't know magically charged stones and and maybe these are ... steaming routines maybe they will be dropped from the website do you have any uh optimistic thoughts about this [noise]\nNo I think what will happen is is that you'll probably see vigor statements in other words the FDA can actually crack down on you if you make a specific medical recommendation so for example if you say concentrated garlic is going to lower\nYour bad cholesterol so called low density liberal protein cholesterol than the FBI can crack down here a few ... and make a vague or claim supports heart health sports joined health boost immunity then it's a little harder to crack down I just I think they're just going to get bigger would be my guess\nNow obviously patrol is simply an example of of more general phenomenon we listen to celebrities and non experts as you say they're selling\nSo is simply an example of of more general phenomenon we listened to celebrities and non experts\nAs you say they're selling snake Oh yes perhaps but\nThey're also addressing things that people may not be able to get much better advice on a lot of your book describes the vaccine controversy that that vaccinations have caused autism and that's that's a field that you specialize in maybe you can tell me a little bit about the back story on that\nWell so the facts about or is this the modern medicine doesn't really know what does cause autism and so when parents of children who have\nThis disorder which is certainly emotionally and financially burdensome you know they want answers and medicine really doesn't have any answers or cures so this is we're often you'll see sort of quote unquote alternative fuel or step in they'll know what the causes so let's say they they say that vaccines cause it\nOr they know what yours are you know Casey and free diets gluten free diets and that's all very seductive\nFor parents who are desperate to do something anything to help their child and I this is the worst kind of ... to me or are people who take advantage of parents desperate desire to help their child but I think it's because there are limits to modern medicine and that's often where you see a groups like the step in\nThe whole ... story that a vaccination causes autism that was actually started by a legitimate medical researcher right I mean it disappeared and a referee journal I meet ... what happened there get give me that story just briefly\nRight so it was a it was a British a guest Ron raw trickle surgeon address surgeon Anita Andrew Wakefield who in Nineteen Ninety eight published a paper in the British medical journal called the Lancet which is you know one of the best of the general medical journals\nClaiming that the combination measles mumps rubella vaccine causes autism for what she had virtually no evidence of a sudden otherwise he had no evidence what he did was he had a case series which is to say\nEight children who had within the previous month received an imam or a vaccine that had been developed signs and symptoms of autism that's not exactly a proof he might as well as published a study of eight children who had leukemia that went in the previous month that eating peanut butter sandwiches and claimed that that was caused because that was about how rigorous is proof was of causality\nThere now Seventeen studies done in seven countries on three different continents involving hundreds of thousands of children showing that there is no relationship between receiving that vaccine developing autism so it didn't stand but the fact of the matter is it's hard to honoring the bell it's hard to scare people once you scared them and that's where we are now\nPeter do spark and to be clear she lives in the United states at the time\nRight right she's I'm HIV positive living with aids and she was part of the AIDS denial is that age I read and not cause aids and that the drugs would be toxic compared to not taking them so she refused to take the drugs that would have prevented her daughter um she was pregnant at the time\nWould have prevented her daughter from becoming HIV infected so her daughter was born unfortunately got HIV infected\nUm then she refused to have her daughter treated with at the time there is effective treatment\nSo uh her daughter died of aids and Christine died of aids after that\nAnd I'm Wondering this is not the first person who has denied the causal relationship and I'm Wondering why her story stands out to you because\nShe became an activist on a topic I'm not just I'm not going to do this for my own body and my daughter's situation but became a vocal activists shit on a website and other things that are actively try to make other people be part of that belief system\nSo something else psychological he drives people to actively say this is going to be what I'm going to stand for and try to convert other people to my belief system\nYou've used the term world view on a couple of times now in terms of framing the belief system I'm In this case professor does for\nMy other people who are science denial is and what what is the role of of a world view or a belief system in deciding whether or not you're going to accept the facts as science\nWe all have our own world views I'm speaking more\nPsychologically are sociologically not that it's a world campaign or something we have our own world views of how the world works\nAnd what's good and bad and how the world should be or how we hope it will be that's what I mean by world views and secondly we have our own areas of what we think are important all of us have our own different opinions and and third we have our own experience and we also are the experience of those people that we trust\nSo some combination of those three\nEnd up making us have decisions about what we trust and believe in\nSo we might believe in most things that have been Scientifically Proven but in certain areas who say well we're not so sure because our world view of mistrust of government or mistrust of\nA big business or we say well we're not so sure of this\nThe stories that you're telling about the science denialism around the link between HIV and AIDS\nSay well we're not so sure of this\nFinally the stories that you're telling about the science denialism around the link between HIV and AIDS began Thirty years ago and couldn't ones say well well that's old news and I'm Wondering what that particular story as science denialism has to do with the science denialism we're seeing\nToday well I guess the HIV causing AIDS denialism started almost exactly Thirty years ago with Peter ...\nI guess what it has to do today is that it should teach us that all of us have our own belief systems and we have a right to those belief systems it's part of the human nature they're governed as we said by our world view by our own view of what we think is important and by our past experiences\nBut when it affects other people out of harms other people then it's not right [noise] the same things happening for climate change the same thing happens with vaccines is when it's taken on for other reasons as a cause to prove some other point of view than it can be dangerous\nRichard Marlene thank you so much for speaking to us\nThank you so much falling\nRichard Marlene is the director of the Rutgers global health Institute\nAs a coda we know that in two thousand eight researchers at Harvard University reported that South Africa's misguided aids policies the gun in the Nineteen nineties and the attendant withholding of life saving drugs caused the deaths of more than three hundred thousand South Africans between the years two thousand and two thousand five\n[noise]\nClearly ignoring the expertise of doctors and scientists can have tragic consequences but are there are cases where we might turn to another kind

when we say that computers in artificial intelligence will replace doctors one day I mean at least we're pretty sure that's not what we mean computers\nHave been shown to be more accurate than human doctors in diagnosing some cancers and other maladies and research fellow in Geneva Qunu at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center is developing artificial intelligence to detect some diseases three years before they will be noticeable\nTo suspicion in other words AI might see things that your doctor can't\nDr ... begins or talks on this subject with what is a common comparison of presentations about a a Chihuahua or a muffin\nThe idea of it really is that there are tasks that humans find second nature for example differentiating\nA Chihuahua and I'm often but adds system can sometimes have difficulty what tough like this\nBut what about when it comes to something that humans can't differentiate you know right now we're able to diagnose a lot of diseases and we have fairly good treatments for them but I think the next frontier in Madison really is\nHow do we detect diseases before they develop how do we detected diseases before there are gross changes in the human body that are so obvious that even humans can't miss them\nSo when diseases develop in the body they're often subtle changes and medical imaging in the way that we can look inside of the body without lifting a scalpel\nCan you perhaps give me an example of the kind of images where you would rather have a eyeballs on the images than those of a you know somebody at a clinic who who would read an MRI scan or an X ray or something like\nThat [noise] sure so today there are some statistics that up to eighty percent of medical diagnoses are made are confirmed the imaging studies\nAnd the example that I've talked about in the past is with osteoarthritis detection so their images of knee cartilage where you show the image to lay person you can't tell what the differences between somebody who's going to develop osteoarthritis\nIn three years of pain versus someone who is not\nAnd if you show the image to a radiologist or someone who is trained to look at the evidence they also wouldn't be able to tell the difference so the challenge is\nThat if there are subtle patterns there that lie beneath human detection can an ass system find dead\nSo have you done that I mean have you have you offend in a machine a whole bunch of photos of the people's knees and then you know seen whether it can tell you three years in advance where there's somebody is going to get osteoarthritis\nYes exactly so I developed a new technology um it's called the ... transport ... but that's kind of a mouthful site called TBN\nAffectionately and basically what TV I'm does is that if you feed it a lot of images of the cartilage and let's say you already had you've already track these patients overtime so you have the benefit of knowing who will actually go on to develop arthritis it can learn what that common pattern is\nAnd what we found is that not only does it find a very specific pattern that's common to those who go on to develop osteoarthritis but that pattern is actually so sensitive that it can indicate in a new person that the system is never seen before and predict whether that's\nSo sensitive that it can indicate in a new person that the system is never seen before and predict whether that person will go on to develop osteoarthritis and prayers they can do this with up to eighty six percent accuracy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Big Picture Science", "city": "Yuma", "day": "03",

evolve who are kind of producing oxygen as a byproduct\nEventually it started to build up in the air and then some of these microbes eventually evolved to the point where they could utilize oxygen for an energy source but again like really predicted oxygen by quite a ways and\nThe only reason today we have multi celled creatures like us that can do things like run and jump and think and build things\nIs because of all this energy we can get from oxygen so oxygen is an essential for life but if you want to have complicated multi celled ... they can do a lot of great things then you need something like oxygen around to give them more energy and power\nSam Kean thank you so very much for speaking with us thanks for having me\nSam Kean is a science writer and he is the author of seizes

it is an atmospheric current of deliciousness running\nOr just an enormous a vat of bubbly melted cocoa and sugar I don't know but it is an atmospheric current of deliciousness running right under my

itself [noise]\nI've never gotten to the origin of this be which and smell and now I'm going to\nA little bit of research tells me that half a mile from the train station is the likely source so I'm going there now\nI'm approaching the factory and\nIt is starting to smell like chocolate [noise]\nWalking through the guitar trucking company\nCan give it to stretch of microbiology\nAll right so this is a bona fide chocolate company and I'm guessing that you may be the source of that wonderful aroma that hits me occasionally at the train station\nYes we are in the process of roasting cocoa beans and the smell from those cocoa beans diffuses out into the air and it smelled like hot cocoa when you're sitting outside somewhere away from the the point it\nNow why is it that I just smell it occasionally um and it seems to be only in the evenings but maybe that's just when I'm returning home but I don't know that every day\nHas to do with the wind direction as to do with the humidity it has to do with all the atmospheric conditions but we're roasting pretty much every day so it's out there but you're just not smelling into the roost in smell is\nQuite full an aromatic I thought it had to be brownies and cookies but it's not as the beans themselves\nTo the essence of chocolate which are the cocoa beans and part of the flavor development is created through that roasting process to get used to the smell I mean at some point does your nose adapt and you don't smell that wonderful chocolate anymore\nAs you approach the plant and smell it will always recognize it but when you're in the plant you could use to smell so thank you very much you solve this mystery for me You're welcome [noise]\nAs I leave the factory the air is perfume to the center of roasting cocoa beans

humans are born smugglers too but you know with the exception of the mouth watering the realm of sweets we often dismissed the odors that envelop of dogs do not smelling is how the map their

being a dog fall I'm going to dog into a world of smell\nI Am following my nose along Amsterdam avenue toward Dr horror with his dog cognition lab at Barnard College I'm picking up odors of hot\nPretzels cut flowers\nIndian spice and I imagine entering the dog cognition lab and being greeted by dog smells in a row of sniffing animals first though I meet Alexandra Horowitz in our campus office [noise]\nWere in your office at Barnard but the dog cognition lab I understand is nearby but somewhere\n... were in your office at Bernard but the dog cognition lab I understand is nearby but somewhere in the vicinity if I were dog I could probably sniff it out\nOr we should maybe revise because this is really the dog cognition lab the dog ... anywhere where we're studying dogs essentially so we do actually\nDo some behavioral tests in this room there's tape on the floor so we are videotaping and monitoring what the dogs are doing but I also studied dogs out and their natural environment in the parks I go to an earth homes I said he dogs they're so\nKind of any place that their dogs could be the cognition lab\nOkay so it turned out the dog cognition lab was right under my nose [noise] dogs have some of the makings of good scientists they're curious about everything they can't stop collecting data but since dogs don't submit their conclusions about what they smell to referee journals\nDr horribly studies there sniffy behavior to make inferences about their cognition and what's ... they are\nDogs have now been trained detection dogs have now been trained to tell us when they notice all manner of object and\nReally most objects have a smell potentially if you had the equipment to detect it so that is everything from you know explosives detection dogs they're cancer detection dogs their dogs who can detect bedbugs of course than any other varieties many other varieties of insects\nThere are Scott detection dogs in other words dogs are being used by researchers to\nFind the scat the ex Greta of wildlife populations that they're trying to canvas but that are hard to see their diabetes ... dogs can tell when blood sugar is dropping\nSo really you could put their nose in any direction just tell them what it is that you want them to notice and they'll notice it for you\nDogs can detect all manner of objects as you say and how much do they need to detect any just a tiny bit and and and how how low does that that concentration go\nWhere they're not even being Smith stripe but it's that some by extension my dog's interest in your dogs roamed is somehow reflecting on not like that to me is mostly a testament of our unease with smell\nIn fact you write that our discomfort with the dogs sniffing the world has prompted some owners to pull their dogs back and so dogs sniffing as much as they would like to because they are getting the signal that they shouldn't be sniffing although that's what they do\nRight I don't think we're ready to accept often that dogs they're sniffing creatures we want them to be polite civilized\nCreatures who don't do that animal let's stick thing like sniffing each other and I found that um a lot of dogs are coming into my studies where I'm basically asking them to sniff something I put on the floor you know I'm a sample of their own Pierre their time it's a quantity of food it's it they're usually benign stimuli\nA lot of dogs who come in with their owners' loan approach the samples\nAnd I think it's because the owners have been spent a lifetime telling that dog not to miss things\nActually when we pull our dog away from the smells we're telling them they're not allowed to\nYou know use that perceptual Oregon and they and they're pretty cooperative they kind of stop using it as much [noise] it's sad that they can learn to use it again right and when they come upon this you know must be like discovering your own superpower now\nI was amazed to learn that dogs can smell well it's not it's not surprising that they could smell the movement of air through the room but because they can do that you write that they can actually smell the time of day so I'm Wondering if you could tell us the difference between how afternoon in mourning smells yeah or what would a dog I say\nI Wish I knew exactly but I think I can almost imagine a little bit it's like the way of seasons have a different smell right we might notice the advent of spring but a lot\nMore is happening when the seasons change than in our living room throughout the day\nThe temperature of the room changes all day right I think that's what it is it's that air flow through the day is pretty reliable um air rises along the walls\nAs the room is warm and then it kind of hugs the ceiling and then starts falling and it kind of crashes into itself and imagery of this and it's kind of wonderful like a backwards waterfalls of air going up the walls and then and then crashing down as a waterfall in the middle of the room\nSo I haven't seen an example of how dogs do use this to tell the time of day but we can see that dogs are attuned to odors in different parts of the room at different times of the day so they are presumably\nWe can see that dogs are attuned to odors in different parts of the room at different times of the day so they are presumably marking that day by this air flow that's natural Airflow\nI'm so for instance one's own smell it in the room will be moved to the side of the room and your abs sense as the day goes on\nWhen you were going to the self directed experiment on trying to improve your own smelly inability could smell like your dog [noise] um did you ever sit in a room and and try to see if you could smell the different times of day\n[noise] haven't sat in the room the way dogs might send in the room all day and try to smell the difference I don't think I have the acuity for that but I have done other ... and I regularly do other exercises still that\nTry to bring smell and prominently so my wake up in the morning I Try to smell how late it is you know five if I don't set an alarm so\nAnd and how how do you smell how how late it is what what is it what six AM versus nine AM that's exactly\nWhat you're trying to smell you're trying to smell kind of the war of the day how much of the day it's happened there is a smell in a room at a certain time of day and I think you might notice that if it was different it's that type of thing and I also try to figure out if there's anyone in the bed with me and I are dog sleep with us\nAnd so I had my husband my cat and two dogs and my son who might be in the bed in the morning and without hearing or seeing anything I Try to\nJust noticed by smell if anyone's in the bed and sometimes I can do it not not reliably not all the time but that's the type of thing I Try to do to imagine a little bit what might be like to be that dog\nI assume you've invested in a king size bed [laughter] it's the biggest that you can get yeah Alexandra Horowitz thank you so much for speaking with us my pleasure\nAlexandra Horowitz has a dog cognition researcher at Barnard College and author of being a dog following

it were why were grateful for our acute station for our exquisitely sensitive hearing\nThe sense of smell may be number one for a dog but for humans is often rated as least important it's the dispensable sense than the one that people would be willing to lose if they had to lose one\nBut reconsider our sense of smell is not only better than we think it is more important than we think smell plays a big role in love and even survival and we needed to fully enjoy the taste of food if you're skeptical about that here's an experiment\nGet a couple of jelly beans different colors they you know are they going to have different flavors\nPut one in your mouth and plug your nose at the same time now bite down on the jelly bean and with your nose ... all you should taste sweetness\nThen release your nostrils and you will be shocked by the experience of suddenly having the flavor of licorice are lime or bubble gum or whatever the jelly bean is and that's a fantastic way of really illustrating how\nSurprising it is how much our sense of smell is involved with what we can Sam\nBut what about the role that our sense of smell plays in those other things like love and survival will cognitive neuroscientist Rachel Herz so that our sense of smell was the first since to evolve\nIt's located in a part of the brain associated with memory and emotion so if you haven't already had the honor maybe it's time to meet your nose it's more than a resting place for your\nGlasses we sometimes read a reference to the extraordinary ability of super smugglers who conduct order tests and pick out the electable foods should we envy them\nSuper smell or is as far as I Know don't exist there are people who are quote unquote noses and that some people who are in the perfume industry primarily who are very good smell ours and mainly because they had been trained and also because they're paying exceptional attention\nTo what they are smelling and the more attention we pay the more we can actually smell because the more of our brain is being used but the other thing is that we are in fact have a unique nose when it comes to the receptors that are expressed\nWhich means that for some people specific odor as compounds are going to smell somewhat stronger because of the fact they may have more of a specific kind of receptor that sensitive to those compounds and for others that's going to smell weaker there's different ones for each person\nSo there may be people who are super smugglers of a specific kind of chemical if that is even true but it isn't the case that there are super smell or is the way they are super tasters and super tasters or something different\nBook on a super taster taste with the you know I as a non super taster can't\nWell you may actually be a super taster so super tasters taste everything more that is to say they get more sweetness and more salty nothing more bitterness especially and sour and it's from the taste that they perceive they also get more creamy and that's when they're eating something fatty or\nYou know less like ice cream and more spicy and that's when I'm eating a hot pepper\nNow what a super taster has is actually more taste buds on their time and people who are tasters or non tasters there's three classification so you're either a super taster it tastes are non taster and super tasters have the most taste buds tasters are like in between there's or the Goldilocks version and the non tasters have the U.S\nLet's get back to our sense of smell then our our nose is actually pretty good at smelling a apparently we shouldn't so our nose was short it's essential we notes and central to taste food and to enjoy the roses but you also have written that it's essential for relationships", "year": "2018",
