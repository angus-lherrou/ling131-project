diner no table just a couple of ... and the son of a milk fever making [noise]\nI've been positive in that like the next people mhm because of our own kind of history in this country that we're going to be bringing a different kind of politics yeah from ... and I'm just wondering where like you know what you think about um [noise]\nNotion [noise] mhm [noise]\nTo be\nThe next or to be Latina\nOur identity\nIs the most I Would say is the most intersection identity in the world so for example I'm Puerto Rican that means that\nI Know that I Am African I Am indigenous\nAm also the product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ...\nAnd to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to champion the causes that everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration for example\nThese aren't just quote unquote Mexicans coming in from the border these are these are indigenous people\nAnd this is their land\n... speaking to you in St Luke's on the Anita proper to regain yet but he was proud like being a ... was a message like look on ... you're in New York or through and through however you wanted to find yourself\nYou know I was\nI grew up with a very strong sense of patriotism\nA very strong sense of we are American I also was raised as you are ... like through and through and\nSo I grew up like\nThe music I grew up around was Hector level the ACLU's and then hip hop in you know growing up around the\nBrand your favorite hip hop artist would be boring though hard\nI grew up around like public enemy and knives Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like yeah fat ... big pond\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so it's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes\nPeople say like oh wow you're\nThe way you articulate your platform at the intersection off\nAnd to me it's not even that we're trying it\nThis is who we are and so what would it needs to be American and what we grew up in like how we grew up around these values was my dad will go visit family and what do they go every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really\nMy dad will go visit family in Puerto Rico every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah you mean like for the weekend well I mean we would take a little family vacation and it'll be like ... new William yeah those are like a two places where we went on family vacation cry\n[laughter] those colonial Williamsburg I'm like thirty going not as bad [laughter]\nHow do you manage that as being a young enough you know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking around member of Congress dreamy with you know right\nUm and at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress\nI think I'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous I just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been that's a process but\nI had a friend come over a couple of months ago\nThere was a magazine that had my face\nOn the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of or political ideas of twenty teens and she looked at it and we were laughing at it because it doesn't feel like this isn't my ... this is an island but we're laughing at it\nAnd she says that's what you are you're in idea now\nAnd I felt like\nHad to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that may be reasons to an interesting question how are you managing your ego 'cause I mean the truth is is that\nYou're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games but it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's also lonely\n[noise] it is and if anything\nThe there are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary [noise]\nIn my brain and in my heart\nI feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of the sixth grade so terrifying\nI feel like I have this huge target because I'm embodying some of the most vulnerable people in society\nThe issues that I'm Talking about or not read versus blue [noise]\nThey're just not their top versus bottom and so\nI still struggle with even conceiving\nThe idea of getting a call back like\nSometimes I talked to our team and I'm like do you think so and still would respond to us now like yeah of course and I'm like will they or I still worry about people showing up to my that\nThere was an article I think it was in the New Yorker where they've made a point of where you know that when you talk kitchens you come down to their level mhm and I was thinking about that also in terms of the way you you said you know you talk to people you approach them you come in and you'll touched them you'll be in your yeah\nAre you thinking about it more as like well this is a really affect a political tactic\nFeel like I learned it from my parents\nAnd when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were\nEnough my parents were never political\nYou know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around the kitchen table but my parents never\nOrganized or did anything like that\nWhen I think about my experience I think 'cause my parents as natural organizers the were so good at building community\nI went to public school [noise]\nAbout thirty minutes north in a small town of West Chester\nI didn't live that kind of ...\nI went to public school\nAbout thirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester\nI didn't live that kind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there\nAnd that's what my family was my mom clean the house\nThe kinds of people that I went to school and\nMy dad really struggled to start his own small business\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling growing up and it was really just picking up you know towards towards the actually the end of his life and so my mom would invite\nThe cashiers from the local Dunkin' Donuts over to the house\nFifty do and to talk because those are the people that are family could relate to [noise]\nThey were always about leaning in to people\nAnd the politics comes back in\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs\nMy number one job is to care about people and to lean into them show them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nWhat is your Buffy the same to you when you're hearing your dad no\nIt's like I'm so close although\nI'm Sorry no authority to threaten oh my gosh\nIt's okay what is the prime tell me what your [noise]\nNo one's asked me that question [noise]\nIt's weird because like I guess I'm not\nI'm processing that you're asking me but it's like um\nIt's like having someone walking with the whole time and I'm somewhat and then like you're going months and months and months and no one technology in the ... next to you and then it's like\nWhat are you trying to tell the young at well anyone who reads the book but especially young let me nuts you know if you're looking at them straight in the eye if you're looking at a young Latino was dealing with these feelings of like am I good enough I'm not a good Mexican I'm such an American girl like I'm so confused I hate my life what do you say to them\nI Want them to know that I see them that I get it\nYou know I Want them to feel understood\nAnd that's what I Want and when I was growing up I didn't really have a lot of literature that spoke to me in that way you know I had a son that he's no but I adored her but like that was it I didn't have anything else and I wanted to write a book in which young women of color could see themselves and they could understand that it's okay\nTo be depressed that it's something that\nIs normal um also that it's okay to be flawed you know because we don't really see characters like that very much\nI think we're expected to be like I like the title does were expect to be perfect\nSociety and within her family is and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know that [noise]\nI Know that they exist\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are\nThank you for putting it into words Eric Sanchez we really really appreciate your work thank you so much

Hassan so a few months ago we brought you a story about how young Latinos are navigating higher education\nAnd we looked at how one university Oregon State is trying to combat the troubling trend of Latinos not finishing college\nAnd a couple of weeks ago we looked at the future of warehouse jobs many of which are filled by young Latinos and ... and we wondered whether or not these jobs offer a path to the middle\nClass ... ... ... these stories were part of a partnership with the community service society of New York a nonprofit that among other things conduct demographic research\nTo help in their mission of fighting poverty in New York City their data helped bring you the stories and today I'm sitting down with lives are Christian he's the organizations\nDirector of youth policy to talk about some of that data that they've gathered about Latinos and education in New York City over the last year\nOr\nSo I think lives are when I first met you you were like probably the geek you were like look I Love data I Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data and numbers and there are a lot of you out there in the world [laughter]\nAbsolutely I think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in basing some of the things I talk about on real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it [noise] you like this really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research and data so what's the ...\nThe particular line of work that we're talking about stems from one day I went with my parents I'm guessing about ten years ago to see the terrific show in the heights\nLike Washington Heights so fit the wake of the day you wake up and I got this little punk gotta chase away\nBecause I actually grew up in Washington Heights where the shows about and it's a a Broadway musical by minimum or ...\nI mean I thought it\nWas a terrific show and it's playing in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights Dominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most ... thing\nI grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nDominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard sauce until I went to college so I started thinking about well I thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map\nThere the diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself I wondered\nIf it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within Latino Americans have been seen the New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the\nDate a little bit to see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are real differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the youth policy field that I work in\nSioux what did you find what surprised\nYou well working in New York City schools and it and the policy field so much of youth policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that\nYou've got three really distinct communities that Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and the largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers really have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican origin in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City so I started to think well\nIf the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together around this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities both ways to make them great and then ways that we can support them to be even better\nRight so I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other demographic in the Latino population so what's up with that\nIt's really interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised in a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some other groups but Latino non Latino\nOne thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights is interesting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group actually compare to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families from Dominican origins and what we find is that when you have mixed schools around socio economics the\nCulture pervades all the different groups in the school so the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really pervades the lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture and among women in particular which is it's real bright spot [noise]\n\nNow in comparison the Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans in New York in other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in areas of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school I'm a college going culture may not be a strong [noise]\nFascinating so there's a whole conversation around desegregation of data it sounds like a very technical thing but what it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of making it into smaller bite sized pieces is that a conversation that is being had regarding ... in the

forklift driver\nGot all these people they're commenting like actually drive forklifts ... and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I've been spending a lotta time doing research on the future of jobs and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot of our future jobs involve forklifts\nAnd that's because one of the fastest growing industries in our country today is the industry of moving and storing stuff\nEspecially stuff that we order on line [noise]\n\nWe're going to start our show by diving into one of the fact is growing parts of the American economy it's

it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses if Amazon\nI reached out to them to see if I could come take a look around and they said yes\nAnd visiting the facility gave me a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increase automation [noise]\nI entered the building bears jumped this wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway [noise] and there are signs everywhere that say no photos once the guard left me and I realized the springtime\nTons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners\nTo under our feet\nWe also employ more than a hundred vote\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to for you to introduce herself as a community specialist I'm not sure what that means in fact there is a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associate\nEntry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase so stealing our customer promise\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground like roads which is good because\nMe will be another way of ADD CGI\nThese automatic guided vehicles\nBasically it's like a forklift loaded up with items but it's totally unmanned and it follows a map of the warehouse floor programmed into it\nIt just wishes bias\nEverything\nIn this warehouse is yellow and gray\nFor another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots isn't always but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon [noise] they're\nPerson shaped or about more like big orange room but their squares and on top of each of them is a set of shelves which holds item operate in\nThe so this is how it works say somebody really wants to order a back massager they couldn't get online once they do that that's one of the item gets tank\n\nProvided to\nMe I don't\nWant to know how many they need\nTo pick the back massager a\nSecond worker calls the orange robots over retrieved massager from shelf and then put it on the yellow track\nKind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor belt set in\nPlace that we're going to go and\nStation it's what it sounds like basically the massage or comes in on the yellow tray and the worker pack that into a box no robots here\nThis is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nTo pick the back massager a\nSecond worker cause the orange robots over retrieves massager shelf and then put it on the yellow track\nKind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor belt set in\nPlace that we're going to say\nStation it's what it sounds like basically the massage or comes in on the yellow tray and the worker pack that into a box no robots here\nThis is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy actually if I can sell a\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo of stuff she's seen someone order\nI asked her how many items does she have to pack a day\nI Know an hour they want us to do about it\nNormally do for should still be so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week [noise]\nSo the very last thing that happens to your back massager is that it gets a shipping later all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nLabel is created and gently place in the air on top and the\nSound\nAnd placing it on to that debate\nHard I have to admit is literally my favorite [noise]\nThere's until the robot though Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two\nThey're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion\nAdvil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly wage to Fifteen\nDollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands of Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says the speakers are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nAnd a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom breaks because they feared not making work quota and that workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nAmazon responded that they didn't recognize these allegations that's accurate they also said they coach people who aren't making the quota and that their attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high while I'm Amazon I learned about the\nYou know we don't have and power over white individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great work place with great team members and ... great benefits\nA consequence of so many workers turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses in the United states\nAmazon primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voice concern [laughter]\n\nSo without strong worker protections and in an ever shifting workforce are these the job that the graduate Patterson\nIt's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no

vote is heat [noise]\nBut here we are at a college where nearly half of the students are let the nose and letting\nUs and none of them are at this event\nSo there are a few things that could be contributing to it seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for ... days particularly from young voters the first problem to share of has is name recognition not enough people know who she is\nAnd part of this is advertising and that comes down to money which the sheriff has a lot less of than her opponent governor Abbott has raised over sixty five million dollars in campaign funds compared to the share it's less than half a million\nBut there's something else at play here something that goes deeper into ... as a candidate\nDuring the Democratic primary jolt Texas a political mobilization group for young Latino\nDidn't endorse the terrorists they endorsed her rival Andrew white they said it was because of her record as sheriff of Dallas they pointed out that during her tenure Cher sell does cooperated with federal immigration authorities by holding immigrants in her jail cells when requested and handing them over to ice\nWe spoke with ... at a young or from jolt about his concerns and he said he was disappointed when the sheriff didn't have a good answer about this at a forum aimed at young Latino voters in April\nI don't want to hear like\nThe New York times reported that one of the students who was in the audience to dance a forum said quote you were a Latino when you were helping deport people so why should I trust you now [noise]\nShare of told us she didn't have a choice she was required by law to cooperate with ice\nAnd in fairness she did famously go head to head with Governor Abbott and twenty Fifteen she was refusing to honor ice requests to hold people who were accused of minor offenses since Andrew white lost the Democratic primary jolt is now endorsing her for it\nTo hold people who were accused of minor offenses since Andrew white lost the Democratic primary jolt is now in door seen her for governor but ... says oh\nMy God I talk\nI asked ... whether she will take on what some of the younger progress is want her to do to protect undocumented immigrants things like fighting to shut down detention centers and to stop deportations\nTime prior to that place but I don't have that power\nThis is a federal issue that Governor\nKnow I wouldn't just make a statement I take action action can be taken in this before\nIt's before is cruel bill\nAnd is affecting the documents that is something I can do\nWhat she's talking about is the ban in Texas on so called sanctuary cities it's a law called as before and it was signed by governor Abbott last\nYear a rag\nHe broadcast the moment in a Facebook my video it's our son in law\nLiberal than sanctuary cities in\nThe law essentially forcing local police to work with federal immigration officials and it allows police to ask people they stop for their papers it\nEnsures that law enforcement officers can and will cooperate with aren't\nSure if I did opposes the law and has made it one of the biggest issues of her campaign she also supports allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in state tuition\nBut then we ask her about another policy that many on progressive are pushing for\nI used to be reform\nAbolish the original task\nAdvice was to keep people out who do harm they've got away from them\nAnd it needs to be reform but do you honestly want nobody to make sure\n\nKris Kobach dead in the opinion of the local people that we've talked to there who ended up paying ... percent do this work with capitalize on that existing sentiment\n[noise]\nFor example in valley park they'll haunt technically was\nChampioned like it like he he technically wanting valley park and it's like a very narrow way so long now he parks is technically on the books but the people who are there have told us one they've never enforced it and two they regret doing it\nAnd so he took that which is not that big of a when I went to farmers branch\nAnd went to a couple of other places and said look what I did for valley park I can do that for you too and then he used that when to create confidence in these towns or at least the appearance of confidence\nAnd use that to sort of plow forward so we know for example that he went to farmers branch Texas\nAnd said I did this and valley park let's keep going there was internal disagreement within the city council about whether they should keep going whether it was worth the money and he said no I can do the same thing for us for valley park and so they press forward ended up spending more than nine million dollars and they are law was entirely struck down\nLike we're not talking about towns the size of Dallas or the size of New York city\nIt's not like they spent nine million dollars and they were like oh wow like they spent nine million dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice on the part of these towns the only person who appears to have really benefited from this is Kris Kobach so if you think now about\nYou know that strategy earlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the larger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump and the White House and directing a kind of particular perspective\nOn policies regarding immigration you know I I think that prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump\nBeing it's hard line on immigration has he has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impactful voice than he otherwise what\nI think that we can learn from what he has told us he believes in\n[noise] I think that it is a sign that radical elements of our country have sort of taken a much larger role and we can no

sleep suddenly jumped up\nAnd later she told me she knew she knew the measure the door and said who'd been knocking on doors you know six thirty seven in the morning like seven o'clock quite remember exactly [noise] and to say a word she got up ... grab the girls it on and went in her room and this was hard you know\nCindy is a Mexican American mother of three and she was being arrested for the crimes of her ex boyfriend a drug dealer even though he's been dead for six years\nThe police charge Cindy for having lived in the same house as her ex boyfriend when he broke the law she received a Fifteen year mandatory sentence for conspiracy\n\nCharge\n\nI mean you're going to charge [noise]\nIn any way it is [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nMm Cindy\nStory isn't unique it's part of something called the girlfriend problem it's a side effect of sentencing laws where women end up serving time for the drug crimes of their significant others [noise]\nEven though they had little to do with those crimes filmmaker Rudy Bond is turned his sister's Cindy's experience in prison into a documentary film called the sentence that just premiered on HBO\nAnd the film looks at the impact of Cindy's time in prison on her and her family and also her fight for early release I'm joined now by both Cindy and her brother Rudy to talk about the film and life during and after incarceration [noise] so Cindy\nWhat was your reaction at the very beginning so you just get sentenced to Fifteen Years and your brother's like hey I'm can we make a documentary about this I mean did you kind of want to kill them at that point\nSo it wasn't a documentary and when he started to film a initially it was just he was taking videos of the girls for me so when I came home I could one day watch them run and play and you know the little girls because I was missing all those things\nAnd so it wasn't until a few years later that he was like hey you know I think this could be a documentary I really want to tell your story and by then I had already met you know so many women whose story was just like mine and\nI understood that nobody knew it was really going on and I wanted to share the story I wanted I thought it was very important I still think it's so important it was a devastating thing to happen to our family you know not just to me it happened to my mom my dad you know my daughter's\nIt was hard for them you know throughout this whole process so\nIt was an easy decision to say yes brother share a story like it was almost my way of you know screaming to the world what was happening\nThere are a lot of things in this country that are filled with shame that we don't talk about\nOne of those issues is incarceration and I really do appreciate the fact that this is something that most people would never want to reveal and you your whole family was like ruined it teaches public shame as a great word to bring up\nHere because one of the layers in one of the overall themes that I wanted to bring about and assume\nWas shame and changing a stigma of a being an incarcerated individual and what that meant and also being with family and when you touch with individual in what that meant and freely letting people look at what the true ramifications we're so that we could possibly\nPut a little bit of that shame on the system\nSo Cindy there's a point in the film early in your sentence where you're talking to your then husband and you basically say look I'm trying to hold it together here I'm not telling you how bad it is 'cause I don't want you to know [noise]\nWhat is it to be a woman in a prison what didn't you want to tell that you can tell them out\nThere's a lot of things there's we can go on and on I mean I never felt safe I mean they were mostly well they were
