elected a new president ... and our own and he is from the far right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they use for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why both not defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution but\nHe is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo judge had to remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy the young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as homophobia\nIs rainy on it he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high motor right\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a than a cold or senior last night which is a Sperling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are actually the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president in Paris\nMost of the people are especially the poor vehicle them minority\nBecause both concern and excitement over Brazil new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks\nYou welcome now we are more about social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking

platform\nI I don't know you see a direct threat in there\nAnd I don't what what would you expect us to do with those like that where you you you want us to just censor anybody that sent afraid I'm going in that what you're proposing huh well I run into I'm ... and here's the thing he answered the bad speech\nHate speech however you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhen does online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light that the man accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats and the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threats she says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nForeigner thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump\nExpressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities who may now for Donald Trump or they allow hate to be viewed a certain group and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line as we are free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says poor by is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional frame or intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want citizens to be responsible

little sad but she said that she said before she was not born chancellor\nA that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to to move aside to listen to what citizens had to say uh and and that is that they have a lack of faith and her government on and so she

Janet Winston goes to the doctor she fills up on gas impacts a sandwich and to the services and that's what I Need to make the three hundred mile fries\nWinston is an English professor in rural eureka California\nWhen she needs to see a specialist she often drives six hours one way to temperate healthcare just south of San Francisco I had this rash\nThat wouldn't go away [noise] she got that rash last winter ever horseback riding and it lasted four months it was it she and like read the like weeds and she made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the skin cream she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all of the things that I had reacted to live bomb near ...\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test\nBend a pain call a phony um\nThey tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement usually found in beauty products Basset traits and some aerosol they put into a tiny plastic capsule many drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substance that they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nDidn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nA statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required

insurer Anthem Blue cross agreed to a negotiated rate of fourteen thousand dollars the company says it tried to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the mass just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than ... patients being left was to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I walked into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases\nAnd that grand piano Winston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for a lobby the fitting the five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWith a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a buck forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive\nPlace to live well no the bay area it's an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert at\nAnd the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor references Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health

fortunate that some people can't tell that I'm trans\nSo sometimes I can just resign\nElections officials in Fulton County where Atlanta is said poll workers aren't supposed to check for gender but every county trains coworkers differently there is a workaround for gender markers getting a passport because the federal government does not require the surgery that's another hurdle though and costs time and money\nChristian O'Neil is a transgender woman from Atlanta who was also at pride at Georgia judge rejected her name change even though she's been living as a woman for years\nIt's going to be really difficult to save up any money would suck 'cause like I Love to have a name that actually matches when I go by and like I Love to have a gender like or that match what I Am\nBecause of that

deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain failed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they ... for the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the ... candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say though that both NATO himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promised to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a load of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out parts of the constitution to report is about the need for the future president\nCole voted an off duty read to help out of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo judge had to remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not at home and\nHe's really on as he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe this I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high motor right\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a ... or senior last night which says Sperling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... power to a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves

later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers that then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know that a four cylinder ... engine does it have the

patience maybe it'll be worth it for a lobby the fitting a five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to a ... year old daughter\nA lovely image at the end of the story of this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand\nKaiser Health news and she spoke to a ...\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place\nTo live well no the bay area it's an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital system in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area\nI mean the expert in the piece sets that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places they might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport

curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girl on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its founder Kim ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that they individually but taking smells that are making a difference\nSo who is Katie ... why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who cut along background\nTo the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in the court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were to be tested on one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools were the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this to be that it has been a net positive for the growth of Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia still allowed the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like the CEO of local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community had the sense of\nA lot of people have the feeling that something's gone wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has not just a a full investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThe condition is known as the cutest lasted ... or a U.S and for short it can start with symptoms that just to be I Lived and difficulties following the CDC has confirmed sixty two cases and the last few months mostly in young children since\nThe CDC began tracking the disease four years ago I told all of three hundred and eighty six cases have been concerned one case with a seven year old boy and his mother Susan ... says her son came down with an ear infection this was back in the fall of two thousand fourteen\nSo I took him to the pediatrician and she put him on a antibiotic\nBut within a few days Evan complained of severe pain in his back legs he became extremely lists are jak and went downhill quickly\nHe liked total control and both his arms and legs you know one minute you have a healthy head and the next minute your kid is totally paralyzed it it it was beyond a horrifying to us\nIt's not clear what caused Evan sickness and the CDC's Nancy ... says unfortunately the cause of this condition is still unknown\nI'm frustrated that despite all of our effort\nAntibiotic but within a few days Evan complained of severe pain in his back legs he became extremely lethargic and went downhill quickly\nHe lost total Michael control and both his arms and legs you\nKnow one minute you have a healthy head and the next minute your kid is totally paralyzed it it\nHorrifying to us it's not clear what caused Evan sickness and the CDC's Nancy ... says unfortunately the cause of this condition is still unknown\nI'm frustrated that despite all of our effort we haven't been able to identify the cause of this mystery illness we don't know who may be at higher risk for developing and got them or the reasons why they may be at higher risk\nNetanyahu says given the rise in cases the CDC is escalating its response and consulting with a variety of experts to solve the mystery\nThey do know that some kids who get it have also had viruses such as entering virus another possible risk factor is West Nile virus which so far there's no common pathogen that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response or the arm or leg weakness and paralysis and most of these patients\nGiven that the symptoms are similar to polio a disease that have been almost completely eradicate it mentioned you pointed out that this is not polio\nRight now we know that polio virus is not the cause of these Athens cases CDC is tested every ... from math and patients none of the fitness have tested positive for polio virus\nThe CDC says despite the increase in cases ask them is a very rare condition affecting fewer than one and a million children but she says it's good to be aware of the signs and symptoms the Ninety percent of those affected our children there are some cases in adults\nWe recommend seeking medical care right away if you or your child developed sudden weakness of the arms her legs\nAnd do the CDC can't give any specific information about what's causing a FM nothing ... says it's good to take general precautions\nParents can help protect their children from serious diseases that following prevention steps like washing their hands thing up to date on recommended immunizations and using insect repellent prevent mosquito bites\nIn the case of seizing points on Avon he's healthy again he was treated with steroids Andy was an occupational and physical therapy for Eighteen months\nElena fully recovered he has regained all movement and

out of the six thousand years ET women who were abducted by ISIS we hope to see at least one ISIS number who did this to one as a woman to\nBe punished for the crimes they committed against gives me the women and we hope to see them in court in public\nI think it is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you set out to do\nIn your case at twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like you have a lot left to do what is next for you after winning the prize\nAnd I'm twenty five to twenty five

that we were not going to get access to the report I was very disappointed as I think many Americans were so I was forced to make a decision without being able to see that report\nForced to make a

by hurricane Michael NPR's Camila Domonoske has the story\nEver since hurricane Michael hit the Florida Panhandle survivors have been trying to get in touch with their families for some it's been a real struggle cell phone signals went down after the storm hit last Wednesday and stayed down from many customers\nHorizon in particular had lingering outages Florida State officials called the company out for lagging behind competitors\nAfter days of complaints new numbers on when they showed just over half the cell towers near Panama City Florida we're functioning\nThere's no doubt run a more positive track\nMatthew Berry is chief of staff at the Federal Communications commission the agency criticize the slow pace of progress earlier this week\nBut we need to keep the attention on this problem and keep the pressure on because there's still a ways to go when we can't have any ... in the next few days\nRestoring cell service is always a problem after a big storm the absence of a signal means people outside the storm's path or left worrying about loved ones they can't reach well residents have trouble contacting local authorities and their insurance companies\nThe FCC says it usually takes a few days to approach full coverage after Hurricane Sandy it took about a week after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico it took six months an extreme situation\nThe problem with hurricane Michael is that several days after the storm the FCC was noticing only marginal progress and the most devastated areas\nWe don't disagree that this is an unacceptable situation\nKrista born is rising market president for wireless in the south she says varieties and slow recovery from this storm was uncharacteristic and unprecedented for the biggest problem is not cell towers but the fiber optic cables that run to those towers\nThe storm passed just happened to go right in a critical area where the fiber it was late and it was just an incredible amount of ...\nAnd it's not just damage from the initial storm as clean up is under wave rising as having to fix new damage to those fiber optic cables\nYou have thousands of recovery workers you have to re remove all happening you have a lot or

important to remember that if the Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts the Saudi Arabia\nI'm frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past\nUm and and I would also argue that we need to look at the broader scope of of the trend line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia um we're selling Saudi Arabia um it's a much more arms today than we were ten years ago or ... and so what I'm suggesting is that we just returned to a level of\nArms sales to a military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to

president replied no but as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump may not want the blame if the GOP takes a hit but he still thinks the election is about him\nPresident Trump isn't on the ballot in November but that doesn't mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz is a professor of political science at Emory University he studied mid term elections and said there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nNot only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year it'll be even more about the president and why is that well first of all because Trump has has tried to make it about him\nAnd horror Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for\nMe to vote for Sunday's vote for me to receive is they vote for me remember the\nOld man our agenda to\nAmerica great again\nIn the a P interview Trump explained that he was making this explicit appeal because the people at his rallies are there for him and some have even told him they don't plan to vote in the midterms in twenty fourteen President Obama made a similar appeal\nI'm not on the ballot this fall\nShort pretty happy about that [noise]\nBut make no mistake these policies are on the ballot every single one of them\nAt the time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama moved approval rating at the time within the low forties Trump's approval is in a similar spot now again Abramowitz\nYou're both public and incumbents who are at risk of losing their seats were probably rather localized election trying to make it more about local issues about things they've done for their state or district and not about the president\nBut regardless

looks ready to recover some of yesterday's dramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei hang saying that the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because\nChina stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years\nNPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nGood morning while I was thirty percent top pertain to stock market sounds pretty darn bad what's going on [noise]\nWell China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble and through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from\nAn economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market dropped by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy at say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edited weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely many blending of currency what it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fat\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks up ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Silicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology\nFacts of climate change Silicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech member station KCRW in December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science\nIs talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place and they were an old papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nLand use agriculture or if it's oil which of course racial\nOur common coaches the climate change coalition he came to the conferences spread awareness about ... [noise] so what is it\nA long chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger ecosystem of technologies okay [noise]\nI think of it like ... ... is like an accounting book everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but it said on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency of the main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit it kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let the amendment more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNot a company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of silicon valley's big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nBecause it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things and\nThese are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing started talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agreed but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place that ... that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something that's how people\nWith a clock ticking on climate change and ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from hike\nFor NPR News I'm Sam honey\nThis is NPR

senior redistricting counsel at the Brennan Center for justice at NYU school of law he says Michigan's maps are among the most skewed in the country\nIt's very clear that their number one goal above protecting communities ethnic geographic otherwise er Michigan it's very clear that their number one goal was to maximize Republican political power\nRepublicans have taken the majority of the state's congressional seats nine out of fourteen even in years when Democrats have gotten so far more votes overall\nThe redistricting proposal would create a commission made up of for Republicans or Democrats and five independence a majority that includes a mix of all three would have to agree on the map\nBut the opposition calls the proposal an expensive way to change the system that already works when delete harbor is a Republican and has worked for for secretary that state she says this whole thing it's skewed to help Democrats\nThe gimmick bypasses\nAre elected official in our

rough day yesterday the Dow was trading up about point eight percent this hour\nBut I don't think the market volatility we've been seeing in the past couple of weeks is not over NPR's Yuki Noguchi joins us now to discuss some of these markets swings can morning ... good morning oh All right so it has been a choppy October yesterday markets closed down and the Dow innocent pie basically erased all their gains for the year what has been going on\nIt's because investors are conflicted and one of their biggest underlying concerns is the global economy you know how the trade war will play out and how higher terrorists might effects it might affect U.S companies\nUm you're starting to see some of that already a caterpillar which makes farm equipment and three am which is a huge conglomerate that makes everything from sponges to car parts\nAh this we talked about how that's starting to affect their bottom line now on the plus side the economy and labor market are and have been chugging along so there are no clear indication that that's going to hit a wall uh some companies are beating expectations\nAnd although interest rates are heading up there still historically low All right\nSo some good factors some bad factors one of those sectors that's been hardest hit in recent days is the tech sector yesterday the NASDAQ which is made up of a lot of tech stocks I had one of the worst days in seven years and this morning we should say it is trading up but what is going on in the technology sector\nIt well the technology sector has been on an even steadier and stronger Bull Run in recent years I'm apple this summer or you might recall became the first company to reach a trillion dollars in market value\nAnd stronger Bull Run in recent years I'm apple this summer\nOr you might recall became the first company to reach a trillion dollars and market value so basically ... tech stocks have already risen very high end of a lot further to fall a and when you have a ... few companies talking as you saw this week about week sales or miss profits\nOn that makes investors nervous that perhaps as stocks are overvalued and tech is a great example actually of how the volatility kind of spreads around the world yesterday you had some us tech firms including Texas Instruments and\nAT and T. reporting some weaker earnings which then prompted the Asian tech stocks including Sony and Sampson to fall overnight\nBut then by the morning you had stronger results out of European tech firms and send U.S companies including Microsoft and Twitter this morning and that's helping shore up some of those losses so it kind of good contagion they're eating is nerve wracking though to see the markets lose like six hundred points in a day\nAnd analysts say this could continue for a while really quickly why is that\nIt's largely because we don't have clarity on some of the questions that I outlined at the outset where's the global economy headed how much of a trade

thank you so what does this mean for college basketball as a whole what happened yesterday you know I'm not sure it means\nAnything for college basketball um in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on in a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically they're channeling of money from a one source um to the families of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school\nAnd what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas\nA Nike or those those uh operations\nHas gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money so that the surprise here is that it has been criminalized a by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. is it's been done for years\nAnd it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in that situation is that a someone will be banned from the NC double a coach who was who was caught um funneling money or or some middle man\nNow there's like ... which is which is a step\n... now you could possibly go behind bars which is uh what these uh these three men are facing\nWhat you have these three men facing that you'd say um but I Want to your colleague at the Washington Post Sally Jenkins room recently that the real defended here should be a university but the universities are actually considered victims and all of this did you see at the same way that she does\nI I don't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the ... universes were being defrauded 'em by the system\nAh because by funneling this money um two players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible\nUnder NCWA rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the universities that have given them scholarships\nAnd therefore they had to fraud at the universities of of value which is a very strange thing to me because

you know our current attorney general sued to take away health care from Arizona and\nYou know he's suing to eliminate and the only protections that exists for people with preexisting health conditions\nAh I Know maybe because I was in health care for governor in ... it's going to impact us here you know the human regional medical center people will lose their jobs if he successful at taking away healthcare\nIt's estimated that Arizona could lose up to forty two billion dollars if his lawsuit is successful I think we need to go back to looking at an approach of issues that\nYou know how does this affect Arizona and\nAnd if it harms Arizona's and guess what we need to be on the side that fighting for our people instead of against them\nWhat issues do you see on the horizon you'd like to see a a bipartisan or a non partisan attorney general's office\nRight now I'm my opponent has the attorney general's office in court defending secrecy of donors to the Koch brothers network so that they don't have to disclose their identity the same way\nThat the rest of us do you know we don't need to be in that kind of litigation where we need to be you know on issues where attorneys general around the country are taking the lead like the opioid epidemic\nUm you know we need to be collaborating at the attorney general's office with local law enforcement with local communities and going after the the drug manufacturers and drug distributors and we've seen a little bit of action out of the current attorney general all in the last year and one month\nUm but boy other attorneys general are just you know ... taking storm a this issue to make sure that we can prevent the harm that coming out of it\nBeing from Arizona you know that it's much bigger than just the Phoenix area or the Tucson area there are a lot of rural parts of the state that feel a little left out of the conversation um maybe even feel like the attorney general has nothing to do with their day to day lives I talked to people about why having someone they can trust in this position is so important\nWhat I've heard because I visited every county most of them more than once I'm what I hear from people is that you know they're not used to seeing the attorney general around any more um\nEvery county most of them more than once I'm what I hear from people is that you know they're not used to seeing the attorney general around anymore um we used to have a tradition of an attorney general a ... on your side we'd come out and not only the attorney general staff\nWould come out once a quarter and meet in a library or another public space where people could bring their concerns and their questions or you know Arizona is one of the top ten targets for financial scams\nThat's in part because so many people choose to retire here uh and so we need to educate we need to mobilize we need to make sure that we're\nAccessible right here in your own home town so that you we know what's going on there you know if there is a problem and a trend that we know you know who to go after", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "25", "locations":
