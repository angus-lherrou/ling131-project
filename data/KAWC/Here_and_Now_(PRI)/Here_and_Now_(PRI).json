education the law was passed and twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens sore in fact according to the Centers for it\nMental health education the law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens sore in fact according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death the Americans in twenty sixteen behind car accidents\nGlenn leaving it CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this law for years Glenn tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and and to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess that's you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans and best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural area suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used correct yeah\nAnd there are cultural differences too there's\nDepending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take in into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we do do in response is\nWe were able to create a resource center at school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the\nState Department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look and see that there are lesson plans out there dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nYou got that teacher training there and other tools so willing people that here in our data word but that's an example like let's say you decided to implement that's in grade school what might a specific part of a curriculum and then what might one be in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on in the gun in first grade second grade is just about things like feelings from about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes had the teen years approach maybe somebody's ah got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that\nAnd recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the\nThe structure now for an individual to have that that emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building into progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people\nLive with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment this night also funnel people to wield treatment as opposed to education\nBut as you noted opposition there are teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids teachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response to look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma\nTalk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that you know this is just a normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's Clementi's the c._e._o. the nonprofit mental health association of New York state what are the groups that advocated for the new law that it's just gone into effect requiring all public schools to have some form of mental health education Glenn thanks so much\nSure I really appreciate Robin\nA profile now of an artist you may have never heard of her name is Mary course from Southern

noting it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country jak rose in his presidency the American Jewish Congress\nJak word fail you know we're so sorry about this route to community\nBut has it's been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nBy first thought was this is a brutal anti Semitic killing tack not only the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was Jews have been living in America comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country\nSee changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities and here we are again one more time or the ugliness not only pop to the surface of does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in America [laughter]\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred do you make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI David says they account for about half the countries where they just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous here have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols on Jewish cemeteries schools this act on Saturday there's quite a shock to the community and to America it seems\nAnd you know we only the so the gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out of out of your feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first for march it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know it's a small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize ... leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe of those that that has been spewing out some of his viral language meal politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities as\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system you know the answer to this\nOr a political leaders they have the microphones most important political leaders of president as a bully pulpit as the biggest microphones in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone of how\nThe biggest microphones in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to that our representatives in Washington are mad governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize began with a loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it they'll go to the to the polls if necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nWell and actually some would say we're hearing the opposite from the president has been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that with her by the marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a panic is not the\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that Jews are pulling the things somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches it's hard to hear but let's listen to these marches again in Charlottesville\n\nSound from a documentary that put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter allegedly shouting into synagogue that had to be tailing\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston\nAnd other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of\nThe wrong time being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having\nA big responsibility in this because of you know his views and his political rhetoric we should all hard to let him do that but you don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to be watching to sharpen a show on TV yesterday\nHas shocked and I know NBC yeah\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that he shows in showing you the wrong county's been setting you said to myself what about how can\nYou speaking of Louis ... leader of the nation of Islam\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why aren't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and prompts a Republican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against\nYou know hatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold president a little more responsible you know he has to since he has the biggest microphone she's going to have\nA you know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass or in the mail\nKinds of towns said that they were fined people on both sides in Charlottesville and some guy permission half as much\nAnd I don't think that you you can you talk about Nazis and the old right and Americans I just don't think the comparison makes any sense to ten of us Americans\nCan't quoting president as American Jewish Congress thanks so much and again since ... the last in your community\nThank you for your kind of thoughts and appreciate the time to be able to express their views of the Jewish community\n[noise]\nUh immigration officials are processing request on business owners who want to hire foreign gas workers to the

I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody asks where the party argue the woman who is in love with the dog\nWith a giggle mammoth but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person\nWho in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like my\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she's trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google is such a Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just cyclists medically they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYeah since they did have ...\nTheir site yes and they all wanted atrocities and what they were just cyclists medically they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYet since they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it would damage children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dogs they they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou will to talk about people we talked about site but you also talk about people who weren't dying their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nOr it could be boats ... or maybe the friend is the narrator\n[noise] you know and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my ... my married are really does this is something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal and you don't dominate cats you'd do dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that into a cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet that can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend yeah\nDogs can be unbearably poignant she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying\nAnd the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head as they do ask her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how is this book it's called the friend from secret unit and took it I didn't have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um [noise] can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle the story to the ground\nPiece of advice that I really like is the simple don't\nFlinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft because they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they\nGet scared and they flinch

outcry over the death of Saudi journalist and us resident Jamal ...\nBecame them says he died in a fist fight inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October the second many people doubt that explanation Turkey's president ... says details of what really happened will be revealed and a speech that he will make tomorrow\nJoining us now is Jane Harman president of the Wilson Center and a former Democratic congressman from California\nGerman welcome back and you think the u._s. should consider new sanctions against Saudi Arabia over this\nI think condoning murder is something we should not stand for our foreign policy is based on values and interests and values that we have in this country a rule of law and a freedom of the press or both of which were violated in this case I Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region a and surely Iran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen\nAnd Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia and Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how a condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also ah suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old\nCrown prince a has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it might make sense from the Saudi point of view which is not something the U.S would dictate\nA to have a a ... you know some kind of a\nAdult supervision are there are so that excesses in his behavior\nWould stop happening I think that would be and Saudis interest I think that the the war in in Yemen has created the the largest could see Manny ... humanitarian catastrophe that we currently see and I think that this episode especially if\nThere was a Saudi cover up and plot ah to to do this is a really shocking and in every sense\nBut do you think that the Trump Administration which has been watching the war in Yemen go on for years now and and hasn't put the pressure on the Saudis to uh stop it that this is going to change President Trump's

year and now over the weekend the Philadelphia Inquirer gave its reluctant endorsement to New Jersey is democratic Senator Bob Menendez an end as is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in\nThe paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this races\nYou get in the paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race is a reporter with WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe\nGerman so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in a mist trial last year he's been trying to change the subject ever since a at a recent campaign of and he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country how has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say he has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and he has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syrians on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nDespite all of that are there have been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party that Senate majority pac just dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez is lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob he he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about just [noise]\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate fighting\nAbove you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not wise was re times for drugs that those cancer patients politically\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the cost of the drugs that his former company makes has called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients a vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up\nSo gene has also you know uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he he went to the\nThe Republican convention so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump a factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nParty in the past from the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump a factor compared with ... Mendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know you've been tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nBut a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey's pretty\nPretty reliably democratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years New Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often\nDoes elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank little beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising this rates it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\n[noise] that is Joe Hernandez of WHYY talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got to\nKnow now that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of boxes of rape evidence or sitting on shelves police agencies across the country are waiting DNA testing DNA evidence can help identify sex offenders by matching their DNA with a federal database\nSome state legislatures are trying to reduce the backlog including Washington state but as Anna ... why rock of member station WBUR a member station K.

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed and that's a time when social life is very important\nWhere teams are forming their identity when what\nReally shapes on a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go online social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of time they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted but Ninety five percent of teens um have a smartphone now\nAnd it it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to you and your friends taxed instantly to want to be the first to post a like a ... so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I Jen is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history\nAnd that's reflected in these big um service that I work with where they're asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high school they go to a more diverse much more likely to have friends of other races and ethnicities too you know hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped the generation\nWell\nThat's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\n[noise] true um but because there's not a draft that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to them\nThat hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\n[noise] yeah they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adults\nBut in our conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors is very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety\nAnd I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on and um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing as another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBy statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say that they're interested in government or social issues or politics\nDan teams were say Twenty years ago what do you think so\nUm well I think because there's so many other things to do there's always the possibility of a\nYou know something new to say on I'm On social media or new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... some of the interview that I did a lot of teens you know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard ...\nInteresting I mean I've had many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general [noise] um but they're also often really smart I I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nOh absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and um they're they're quick thinkers on there's actually data showing that IQ has has gone up over the generations so I think yeah smarts is is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older ... and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due to to assist in any way with some of the problems of this

S. seeking asylum but it is happening right before the midterms what are the political implications\nOf the political implications are pretty big because this is the president's go to issue and he has really grasped onto the caravan he's even said that the caravan and Kavanaugh will be the two most important things about the mid term he's\nNot only said without evidence that they're criminals he's even said that they are terrorists uh he's repeated some of the a commentary on Fox News that they are members of ISIS or al ... somehow\nIn the group of people who are traveling to the border by the way they're about last time I checked there about three thousand miles from the U.S border but he's been saying that Democrats are funding them so this is an issue that he thinks\nEnergize his base it's what he started out when he came down the golden escalator talked about in Mexico sending rapists this is his go to issue\nA lot of Republicans would prefer that he focused on the economy and the strength of the economy right now here he is a President Trump speaking to reporters outside air force one on Saturday\nVote again a very major tax cut from Italy company [noise]\nAnd if we do that it will be some time just prior I Would say that have ever\nHave made your tax guy we are going to be putting in [noise] and are setting very deeply right now around the block a major attack for middle income people\nNow Mara Congress has not even a session a right now and November is coming\nRight now around the block a major attack for middle income people\nNow Mara Congress has not even in session a right now and November is coming right up ... what do you make of this\nHe's just making it up as he goes along there are no plans to put their Congress hasn't in session as you said they can vote on this\nBut he said it's going to be major it's going to be for middle income people why because the tax cuts that they already passed or not popular Republicans thought they'd ride these the tax cut bill to victory in November but people don't buy it broke RMC polling Republican Party polling has shown that people think the tax cut when mostly to the rich but this is\nWe felt that he was on the university to provide the because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the midst of an epidemic affects everybody\nOthers question if it could encourage drug use that story plus\nThe fallout from Jamal 'cause she'll she's staff this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nWe hope you can join us for all things considered this afternoon from three to six here on K.

worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping of more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of the night but it would happen to those girls\nSome managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released their story is told in the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram\nIt airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha how ... ... so the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nThe yeah it was a part of the condition of the access we owe the kid the access with the government consent and the only way to do it but they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the girls about what had happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram\nAm partly a I mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the go to a released in may we started filming with them and not government safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks\nSo it was quite well they um with still protesting what had happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us we're not count says to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBut he couldn't be any time we were alone with the go to the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so to vote I think the government will say I wanted to manage how the rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because\nThey were held a three is this little ... and was down and they were released\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um they was free to speak to his they did give his diaries discreetly\nIt and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't did that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they call the and the full ... treatment ... ah and then the phone what we do is the uh the ... who had taken lead actually just the tip of ...\nAnd in the film what we do is the uh the girls that that you vote girls who were taken would actually just the tip of the iceberg there were thousands of go in Nigeria who was taken by Boko Haram\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the\nTestimony we get a sense of what happened to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because ah you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid says I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and then the phone that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier or you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the ... like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it say she ... she says I Would say months pregnant when I ran away and when we fast that had like she\nShe did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well uh and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have a pet who have either been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay about ... children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up on and fight\nAnd then when the military engage with ... and they tried to take back territory they will ... ah people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been cannot but they're just fled their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah is it functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will run into town than these tickled him id become a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run too because Boko Haram you know they don't just could not they then Ben and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on the Web the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that way you have to them\nTheir their outcomes but then a lot of the I Love the timing displaced people end up living within the community so\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped vocal her um but they both have been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people have come\nThere is some fair towards people who have escaped vocal her um but they both have been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they try to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory isn't a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize it's controlled the Nigerian military\nAnd their constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan that was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know\nWho to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into bits of the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line was dying you just don't know why the threat is coming from and where and when I said there's a lot of mistrust [noise]\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and trying to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your film\nI'm ... and has changed my life now and I think in the nation I mean ... he's All right ...

networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content here's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy\nThrough more on Fox afterward well what do we fought for the gateway listen ... take on prime time with a five minute we can recap if I say\nThe Sunday Edition sponsored by Google three\nHere now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what's going on with ranking behind this\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that\nAudiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new show\nOn let's take this first change Fox is calling it the night and he's nine second sixty seconds ...\nPackage as entertainment or new show\nOn let's take this first changed Fox is calling it the night and he's nine second sixty second breast or I'd be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jackpot what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means ... traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second you this has got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nAnd that also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block a brand new content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy or brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in primetime by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSort of the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume advertisers like this they're not sure yet or they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain a\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much thank you so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile\nRide sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThere are also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nThan your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost two hundred fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about this specific how get around works uh right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYeah so you don't let her out you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nA lock the doors and Dr ... and you can rent them pretty nice cars by the way yes you can\nInstantly you have a car you locate it from the phone on lock the doors and try and you can rent them pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attest led to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's ... ah which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go at something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which is car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more of this market gross for all players\n... some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said that those companies and sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent\nWhat do you what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nIs I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely an ride sharing a mechanical I turn it on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like Toyota over so it was continue investing those partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nSpeaking of labor and Toyota I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and something that we've since day one than\nSort of very aware of in fact it's taught him was cars that drove it to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues that eventually strangers you know it makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those cars to be used by more people different use cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opened a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around or checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to them\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of vehicles are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me then drop it off and then they would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were fifty years out and autonomy as sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where you know the cars you know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Yuma", "day": "22", "locations": [["Arizona", 34.5003,

and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing noticed them in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story in the masterpiece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius in that field it's just that\nUh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer Isaac\nOlivia fabulous well we'll

thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story week which was on the same program\nAnd to my enormous surprise Goldberg variation turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live\nIn a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nFriendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all\nAnd it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece

spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because it was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and Deborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both\nMentioned in relation to Goldberg variation that Arlene crochet had panned it and that she was the most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes [noise]\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called you and Robin affects

under routine and nobody cares still and cares is you know you and a few people that us and question\nObviously the public didn't care because I Won\nThe election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI fall on the German and ways and means just stop delaying get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now high Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business and directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested\nA upon receipt the committee must examine the information in a confidential manner\nUm but it can important agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request\nAnd to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol le defended could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see\nThem well I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation\nTo submit any of the information that its obtain to the full house where the full Senate\nAnd presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote the committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of reasons um could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is the tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out\nIt's a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories or the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a fall there\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story\nYeah it's well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee and the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I I think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law and the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances\nOf the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety reasons two principal one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials\nAre the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get the tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the president and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nOr there was a similar concern or about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who I'm with an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or place in a blind trust\nHis business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously then raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nUh the the the Coolidge administration that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing administration push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have\nThe authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want

government it needed to have the authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what do we really going to learn from them well\nThat's a tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be satisfied without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think as a policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about

[noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying was\nNot what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in Lucerne county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would here is like not actually going to build the wall but he's gonna he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep code and Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering or what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the press his job candidate\nSays something and the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much of a ... who out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable [noise] what\nAbout religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump\nIt's still predominantly Catholic not\nMajority so there's a rising are evangelical population Trump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote so I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does\nHe's appointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical\nThey're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing and that he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place uh right now in twenty Eighteen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is ... you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict or um the ripple effect is a widespread and ah I read the county coroner\nThis is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict or the ripple effect is a widespread and ah I'd read of the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's an enormous problem and is trying to raise public awareness about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving is a brain brain there's not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and I'm working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\nMaybe at the margins are the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really a sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump or the Republican Party have come up with an alternative plan he said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nThere's only going up the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you'll Republican Party doesn't seem to care ... ... what about\nThese voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able\nTo do they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's personality over ... and everything else\nDo you think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)",

for us all to remember too that we have long since Nineteen thirty two over long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that continue to be important counterterrorism partner or\nCustody of the two holy sites are there and important strategic\nAlliance of the United states so we need to be mindful of that as well\nThe United states also has important economic ties to Saudi Arabia and joining us now to talk about that as far as that host of the podcast full disclosure Robin let's start with oil how much oil does the U.S import from Saudi Arabia\nBut that's about Thirteen billion dollars of imported Saudi oil and that's a now about four percent of the dollar amount consumed it's actually not that much when you consider all of the developments and the U.S shale patch this game has completely changed over ten years\nAnd what about us government bonds we've been hearing in recent days that the Saudis own a lot there one of the biggest foreign buyers of us treasuries\nYeah look it was last clocked at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars of US government debt this summer which sounds like a lot but then you look at the likes of China and Japan which have more than a trillion dollars each\nThese are the two biggest foreign holders of us German securities they could if they wanted to kind of hold us hostage on that but it cuts both ways the Saudis\nThey really can't do it a oil shipments our dollar denominated for the most part they need a stable dollar they are very threatened by too strong a dollar so it's a situation where you really have to put it in perspective\nAnother important part of the relationship that has come up is arms or the president of the United states has mentioned that the Saudis by billions of dollars of arms from the U.S he says a hundred and ten billion that number is disputed but then we heard this\nFrom a a fan of President Trump's evangelist Pat Robertson who spoke earlier this week on the seven hundred club\nWe wrote an arm or saying that everybody or in a place um it's like one of the hundred and Ninety million dollars is huge and they only allow them jobs and I don't there are a lot of

they\nLearning how far inland the storm read some of the Titanic Ron ... is an emergency management director in Jackson County Florida he's in Mariana where there was three deaths and Rodney a year in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nRight we we took a direct hit the when it hit us it was right at a high cat three low cat for which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm although a lot of places and people realized that they stole it does affect people that deep inland\nAnd when you've got a storm of this magnitude in moving as fast as it did it held together a lot better and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impacts included you in your home was hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged and pretty much it it it is destroyed the the structure stood the house basically over pressurized and blue part on my roof off and we're hoping to get some some adjusted on it today\nYou know well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us a thumbnail of what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and if it's the damage is it just off the scales bath and buildings down almost every country has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that it used to live here and come back so they don't even recognize a town\nWell the county appraiser ... told the Tampa Bay to be in that she guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of homes and businesses in the whole county ... county were damaged she's using tax will an aerial pictures and say that you sent\nA sense that we all we had a\nCrew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plus are completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nOr someone with Gulf Power spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had to rebuild of the entire electrical grid and rented stand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd that after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were tone do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for the storm do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do I can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome difficult job and they have had very aggressive programs that train back those trees to upgrade the grid\nAnd I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done it absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nOh what what are some of these is because I I think we heard in one report that horizon is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does ruined between towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood is just that was so much to breed though they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped until they were not transmitting\nNo you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to find a study on storm response failed in the state legislature twenty Seventeen\nDo you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level or the ...\nJust turned twenty Seventeen do you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level of emergency convening on what to do going forward\nLooking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty show of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast it all worked with the structure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike on the run and just briefly um does there have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know is so much climate change is it is just a natural process that occurs over the years\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast ... a town wiped out and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that uh this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me and my level there's not a course of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee this will change the climate of my community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County and Mariana Florida we wish you the best\nCase thank you very much Mm\nWell parts of the country are lucky enough to be

I I Can't I have nothing to say and she said yes\nYou do and I thought yes I Do oh\nYes I Do and it took me seven years you take us into how this could happen\nThat your stepfather was sexually abusing you and nobody knew and into what you describe as your dislocation sort of is you're separating yourself from that then there's of an odd dislocation for the rest of your life\nUm there's a saying that what's fired together is wired together\nSo that when my stepfather came in and pick me up and held me and he was big and bold and loud and I was tiny and shy and frightened and and I wanted my mother to take me into her arms and put me safely on her hip but I could sense she wanted me to\nShow that I was happy in his arms because she needed him to be pleased\nAnd and I was being seen I was being held and seemingly adored\nI this must be love\nAnd yet I'm terrified so early on in my life those two things got wired together love\nAnd terror understanding them mechanisms that I used to survive I'm and how they served me for so long in my early career they serve me but I had to leave them so that I could then try at Seventy two to leave them behind\n... you had a boyfriend Steve who became your first husband who helps uh a dysfunctional family function that you became pregnant ended up in Mexico and it sounded like I have and again that felt like a dislocation like this ... this is an ... that can't be happening and six weeks later you're gauge it\nI was in pieces when things would happen I'm at seven and eight and nine and ten that were just too much for me to handle I learned to send myself out of the room that terror with not there\nThe sadness was not there the rage was not there and the part of me that was the taskmaster could stay and do the tax that were required and as I started my early career I was still able to send out the parts of\nRequired and as I started my early career I was still able to send out the parts of me that were overwhelmed luckily when I was twelve years old\nI found a stage I went to a public school and the San Fernando valley and they had a theater arts department and I did my first scene when I was twelve years old and ban\nSomething cleared bell rang everything was quiet\nI could hear myself something that happens out when you're really in a craft\nAnd you're not in your body anymore so that when hand in hand with coming out of being in the kind of traumatic childhood place that I was in but it was acting\nIncome civil the TV show based on a true story of a young woman with multiple personalities\n\nCivil civil who you\nCan do anything I can do anything at one [noise]\nOf course you're phenomenally talented but of course you're going to be able to play that person because you've divided so much of yourself up\nI didn't ...

E. dot com\nIt's here and now in Nineteen Ninety to ... went into orbit on the space shuttle endeavor and became the first African American woman to go into space\nNow twenty five years later ... has her eyes on the sky once again today she is launching a new initiative called look up for one day to day genocide wants people to upload photos of the sky and record their reactions to what they see they jettison joins us now to talk about a welcome to hear now thank you\nSo you're asking people to download this app sky fee and upload photos tax videos audio recordings of themselves experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do what\nWe're asking them to share what happened when they look up at the sky daytime are nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside looking that will help us to understand maybe a little bit more about each other and it's just a tiny bit more connected around the planet\nSo you know some people will look up at this guy and they will fill love they'll fill hope they'll fill some people may feel afraid they may still wonder expands it and how they express that\nIs what we want to capture\nAnd we want it had to share with people in real time so it's not just you got it\nThey expressed that is what we want to capture\nAnd we want to have a shared with people in real time so it's not just you're going to take these photos and you've got to put them up we're going to display them\nTo the world in real time on a digital globe that people can spin and they can look at they can expand they could go to different folks around the world so I can no in Houston, Texas what someone is thinking in New Zealand\n[noise] so I I have to say I love looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of Marjah sky periods yeah the nice guy in a nice guy well but but in the sky period and and in the last a couple of months we've been able to see for planets or every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus\nAnd I've I've taken great pride in telling people about that but the other feeling that I often have when I look up because I live in a city is disappointment that I can see more because of there's the light pollution\nBut I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's started looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution that night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are we're even seeing our impact of on this planet\nAnd so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know we're we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people say we're always talking about stars right\nBut it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this thin shimmering layer of light that is our atmosphere is this planet that warms up and called us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nWill so it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to\nClimate change [noise] well I Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because he was saying\nToday we have these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happens when we're come face to face that\nI can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to this guy something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happened\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you\nLike you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you know as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have\n[noise] no I actually have a view of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd and imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable I felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way we were calling\nThe ... that we have that's completely free we're calling it\nA sky feet at right is this guy selfie [laughter] and that's sort of like our connection between the sky\nYou know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here no doubt Oregon learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of uh this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions but we have you because you were in space you're the principle of the one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years\n[noise] so let's I Want to hear your starship is about making sure that capability for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years that it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of uh\nThe governance in terms of you know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send right right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure they were keeping this planet well then counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what the incredible about space exploration is it is really change fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form in what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship\nAnd the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out ... as a crew how to live together that means that we don't foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do change just what happened to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference [noise]\nThird now are a number a small number but a number of African American woman who have gone into space but you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nSo it it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up in space and it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything\nBecause I would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up", "year":

U. and read and I know you and your colleagues have been really pulling at this threat is quite a story Michael made land for for more than two weeks ago\nBut so many people still displaced do we know how many\nRight when we last spoke with FEMA they told me there are more than a thousand people and sheltered at this point and of course we know that not everyone who was displaced by the storm are are those people in the shelter so we can imagine that that number is much greater than that you know thousand or so people\nWas among the with family or friends or in cars uh your colleague Lynn had her spoke with tons of Denise Graham she was evicted from a low income housing project in Panama City because of the storm damage was listen\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nSo you multiply her sure by many and she has been approved for FEMA rental assistance we forget about it I mean she was in low income housing but there are all these renters who don't have any recourse she got to see mode rental assistance and his waiting on a check\n'em but but then what I mean where is she supposed she can find housing but where she's supposed to find housing\nRight that's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for housing and FEMA\nHas made some hotels available on their their vouchers that you can you just say these hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas so people have to have transportation to get there really there's about twenty that are accepting vouchers\nAnd they do the you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers\nBut there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here we come we're putting the trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course the local governments are are still putting themselves back together\nAnd so I think that's why we're seeing sort of this as low risk by there all the shelter is of course yeah well\nWell uh and by the way we see female people all over the place in their boots teachers they're working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter and a local high school and just want to listen to how\nWe say we don't charge you name it was just like all the windows busted out back\nAll the trees come down and landed right beside the church though yeah [noise] um I have I Am her house was destroyed a brother in law is houses destroyed ...

nuts yeah you're on it on okay good good\nI'm Dr Andy ... with your solar research Institute and we are at the edge of a pit that we're excavating dating from modern stuff right at the top all the way down to potentially maybe Fifteen thousand years ago some of the earliest occupation\nNot only in Florida but in the new world wow we're kind of just getting to the the good stuff as we get through the earliest policy material and get into the end of the ice age the end of the terminal places the material will be looking at things in the twelve to fourteen and it's like I said as much as Fifteen thousand year old rage\n[noise]\nBuckets are lined up shovels sent me first across the tickets for ... thousands of years with every they're careful exacting work you never know what you might\nHave been finding stone tools just somebody knock the big flake off it was really sharp on what age so they took a little on what a\nPiece of answer or another hammer stone perhaps interest sharpen did up a little bit more a drill the tip of broken off of that and we're probably guessing and again in the five six thousand year old range\nPart of today's excitement it's been that we had a little lenses charcoal and as we dug it out this morning it started to have some structure to it a Tom said perhaps corn cob\nIf a corn cob shouldn't be in nine thousand year old dirt share but it's conceivable\nSo so that'll be that'll be the excitement this afternoon as removing this little pedestal that's got quite a bit of charcoal and if [noise]\n\nThe scraped material is dumped into the buckets and poured out over what looks like a screen door laying on its side on legs now move over here to a screen everybody knows that this looks like it's framed and you're brushing that can truly looking for\nA fun

hoping\nThat this was probably ten thousand years old [noise]\nI just touch something ten thousand you know ... school [noise]\nFlood that may be one of my head that Dr heading who just wiped out a few hundred years of history with one for for someone who was a mess up your [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nIt's funny but the reason he slipped may not be artifacts are most beneficial to archaeologist they reveal their stories best when they're found where they were left and\nStorms like the recent hurricane Michael can disturb that if you stand in a place\nLong enough you can feel the same ... a little bit and it's because you know it's no into problems and agitation\nYou think that's the rain as you are you shake your fist at the elements to just now\nIt importantly [laughter] um\nBut they think there are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they're in place and not currently accurate and that's really why we were so very concern is that we have an open excavation pit almost a meter deep with soils that have not seen the light of day for the better part of nine thousand years\nWe've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps stand by the whole thing and we we got off awfully\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by Amanda devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes with laid\nThe original work was done by the state archaeologists Kelvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the lodge in Nineteen Ninety four and that's when some of the most important earliest finds were made\nCalvin Jones isn't he the one who got a real barrel of loan delivered to his home he's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said wait a second this dirt is more than dirt as part of this aging burial site yeah here\nThey had a delivery of dirt and within the ... there were\nThat is archaeologist Barbara clause of the Florida public archaeology\nNetwork and we've traveled to the place where Calvin Jones got his loan and realized it held treasures it's now the lake Jackson Mountains archeology state park in Tallahassee a beautiful carpet of love meeting to grass covered hills rise like the facts of green elephants one bigger than the others\nOkay we walked across that vast lawn and there it is I mean how how high near would you say that ...\nThis is the politics of the seven mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt\nAnd let's just backup what exactly is the mound this\nSite is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as the mount builders over\nIs the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as the mound builders\nOver time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain and the ... when that person past they would then be hurt or buried in the mountains and their home would be burned and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader with live on top of it so over time became taller and taller and you can actually see the different layers of soil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burned homes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplits climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pirates that\nIt's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today it's a definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nI feel that but we are going to climate stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would've done hundreds of years ago so here we go [noise]\n\nAre they native people who are direct descendants of the people who live to use the\nDescendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we are not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know there's concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand a de\nThese mouths and we're right on top now these now have weathered uh women a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of the mound and then you have an open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains\nHere we are ready on top of the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community we'd get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis would strategically placed over here to our east we have like Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic needs food water and shelter there are other sites similar to that throughout the south east all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up into Ohio even when they were excavating tear it tracks and\nDot com

that prey on oysters then there are oil spills over harvesting climate change which brings severe drought\nThey were once hundreds of boats pulling in thousands of pounds of oysters outside this

the state is grappling with toxic algae it was just inundated by hurricane Michael and we've been looking at the Appalachian coal river which begins upstream in Georgia as the Chattahoochee\nThat everyone can agree on but Florida and Georgia have been locked in a wider war over\nGeorgia's use of the ... river water\nIn June the Supreme Court agreed with Florida that the state does suffer ecological an economic harm from Georgia's overuse of the law a special judges still sorting all out which will take time why does this matter well we've talked about how the local police or industry

[noise] now\nI'm looking out on this day it looks gorgeous can we describe what what is the grass it's over there\nJust got really healthy marsh is throughout the apple at Kobe that one of the protective factors in terms of talking about the storm that has come in\nMarshes protect from storm surge flooding so those are going to slow down wind and rain Florida or Easter population Ninety percent of it was coming from the Appalachian coal ... percent of it nationwide and and that's changed dramatically over the past couple of years the oysters and indicator species right at the Keystone feces\nIf you have a healthy oyster population that scientists will tell you guess while you're going to find out you've got healthy fish that healthy crowds you got healthy shrimp and so when you see this\nChallenge with the oysters guess what you're going to probably find out you've got challenges going on with their other parts of your system\nNear the river keeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having a healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with\nThis river and really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a kind of place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designation for you but you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river may mean to them and you will get\nYou will get many stories of why people love this place in our fiercely protective of it and they include\nScientists and researchers say\nWe've retreated to deliver keepers office a boat you had to be called off the bat whether Dr Felicia Coleman director of Florida state's coasts and Rene lab her\nColleague Dr ... brook and write ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us start by asking Dr column and that question we started with why do we care about this\nI'd say the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all his nutrient is not coming down into the salad needed water and coming down anymore so that's a really important component I think that's overlooked well and talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish gross\nIt's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like always just like the conch which like the saltier water\nYeah when the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happened the problem with salt will truth that encourages these marine credits at such an oyster drills and ground called\nAbout these oyster journals that sounds like a horror film duct duct tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like come out\nSit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his scrape scrape scrape and eventually

and stick its ... basically consume the always the from within and it's not a whole lot you can do about it it is rather efficacy\nI'll check it out on YouTube [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I mean some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish\nLet's start with the day and\nA an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if\nWe're constantly reacting one of the things that happened in the wake of the oil spill was at the fisherman were allowed to go out and ... all the oysters is the fear was that the spill would come in and kill the shows in a couple of years later and there was no bridge stock left there\nTo re populated I think about the function set oyster surfaces beyond\nThe economics they clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster race are she can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it in a deliberate fashion\nOne of the problems with a day over the last few decades has been\nReaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting coach out there and if that Paul ... is that voice ... shall what they larval oysters settled on but\nDistributing it without a plan you might as well be casting it all into the when what\nWould you recommend I mean we haven't even mentioned climate change and the droughts that has been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be\nFair particular types of research that could be done that could relatively quickly and the next couple of years make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the\nFisherman really understand what native but they want their livelihood restored so there's a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest fix closing the best probably not a terrible idea and I think you would find fishermen that fully support that full\nDr ... research and really committed effort instead of throwing short term solutions what about these selling nation plant\nI think there are more problems\nAnd the ... you know they had the drought back in two thousand seven and nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but the all the time and come back\nUsually want a system crashes it's not just one thing but they are also other factors in play you know the
