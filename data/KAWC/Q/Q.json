get started it was kind of an accident certainly my part of it was but I did do the first one with the wind or back in the early summer of two thousand and three and it's the team plus years now and it was incredible fun I'm\nI'm Dave wider and I am a media hyper and I'm I'm always trying to find new forms of human expression using technology and I in a real sense among the creator of pod

to the world\nKnow what kind of democratic experiment is blog idea\nWell um gosh what changes all the time when we first started doing this it was just a bunch of people sort of of writing hello world

programming but he had sought me out to do it with him in and I did my on my part when it could but he he he knew what we were doing and I was just on the right\nIt is no coincidence that spring of two thousand and three was started the Iraq War\nPresident George W. Bush has launched war against Saddam Hussein we can tell you that these targets of opportunity has been hit\nAnd let me ask you first of all of our crew there are you and uh and\nAnd and all are well\nWe're a little excited David I'm sure the obvious but yet we attack\nThem they win Berkeley American media in particular had totally dropped the ball they didn't see what was coming they own endorsed it no sort of the consequences\nAnd the blogging and eventually pod casting became one way for ordinary people to speak their mind on the subject that you know the great wise focal our society had completely missed not was the beginning it was people looking for a way to speak their mind [noise]\nI Want to ask you the route political question which which has to do with the Bush administration and the and the war in Iraq\nWell I mean it's ... marine number one so she is just amazing a number two when I was trying to put together all my research for when I entered Buffy for power in the blood and twenty Fifteen\nI was really frustrated by the lack of information I could find 'cause I'm a researcher I like to dig deep you know and there are just so many black faces that um you know music\nThe traditional places where I Would go to find out about musicians of that kind of iconic status uh had it written about her so I felt like she's really been kind of like a race for music history if you're not sort of written about ah there's no record of your work we all know of course that she's an icon and amazing\nUh but I just really felt like she you know her work and and everything she had been quite minimized\nAnd ah after we had our conversation\nFor power in the blood I didn't want to get off the phone she said to me that she didn't want to get off the phone she's had allowed and I was like\nOh it's amazing\nAnd um I really left that injury wanting to think about writing on an authorized biography of Buffy ... Marie\nSo Bobby was it hard to put the trust him someone to tell your story no not\nReally and I was so glad that I'm\nI'm you know a couple of years earlier I had read and read his first book we ought to know [noise] um because uh there's ... there's so much that comes through in her writings she's a beautiful writer she's real intelligent is real funny [laughter]\nAnd she can see if she can just kind of see be between the lines of um [noise]\nUh both to show and the business and that's always been real important to me both of them and it really is a difference between the show and the business and so she could see that I kind of been abused and get their own by the business that the show is still a little ... a whole lot of fun for me and I think that's one of the places we really connected on\nWell you're so funny and like your music is so full of hope I mean it's none of none of the things that have been sort of like done to you arguably\nHave damp and your spirit at all and I I Am one thing I Love this book does is that it does set the record straight on a couple of things that I think people get wrong about ... feet for example you you didn't play Woodstock\n[laughter] [laughter] I Know and sort of if you think if we would start a Andrea in the book she points that out yeah people almost every concert in the U.S someone will come up doing if they were so good at Woodstock I just love you you really just a best friend and I would die [laughter]\nWhat do you go I spent some time with Joni Mitchell and they tell her the same thing it was so good at Woodstock and she wasn't there either I don't know I guess I don't know what they were ah smoking that day but you know drugs or I were there on the assumption\nIs that you would be because you were such an important part of that time so I feel like people just create the scenario they wish that had existed\nBut it's interesting that this myth of some times bigger than the actual story itself and it and it leads me to some of the challenges he must have had an injury I mean you knew he was born I reserve somewhere around Nineteen forty one but there aren't a lot of records from that time was what what is it like to put together a complete story above your life with such little information to go on\nI like the fact when I'm because I Do care so much research and I really care mostly about sort of people's lived experiences so\nBeing able to like just spend so much time with Buffy like she was so generous with her time we were on the phone constantly so she really was able to fill in so many different gaps where she could and then I Would be able to sort of bring 'em a different sort of lends from the music industry point like the fact that she's\nNever been nominated for induction into the rock and Roll Hall of fame\nIt would be able to sort of bring 'em a different sort of lends from the music industry point like the fact that she's never been nominated for induction into the rock and Roll Hall of fame and these other huge life that's Donovan gets a lot of credit for her song you just you know terrible I'm very frustrating so these kinds of things are where I can bring my lens to it\nI think this is the I think this is the part of the book that I find the most fascinating is is it what Andrea on earth things about you that you have perspective on it and we'll where do you feel like you and I both learn something new about your story ... an example of that is just take a listen to it\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] I'm not Cracker Barrel from time to talk to you is that the contract occupy Cracker Barrel or\nIf you're just tuning in by the way this has not Saturday afternoon to the opera do I was speaking with other legendary Buffy ... Marie and our official biographer Andrew Warner above your first crush was check off\nA little girl is piano when I was by age three and I fell in love with it the way on the other kids love sports ten Barbie dolls I loved music\n[noise] and I I started playing fakes confiscated very young age but after you\nYou found something interesting in Buffy the love of took off he ran\nWell I you know I think one of the things I just thinking about what it is to um come out of trauma and where you place your trust in people my assessment was that you know it makes a lot of sense for one's first crash to be won a natural musician I'm a dead natural revision\nDo you find safety in in um sort of someone's you know hypothetical arms but isn't there at all but ... you can take a lot of comfort in from their music because you love it so much and I think ... and that was sort of my assessment was that it makes sense\nThat you know a a young girl who's coming out of sort of uh some traumatic situations in her childhood would gravitate towards like a dead gay classical musician and and I think I think it's a beautiful you know there's a lot of\nThere's a lot of hope there but there's also a lot of sort of that darkness that we we moved through as well\nAbove you is it is a challenging for you to relive some of this and the writing of this book to talk about early trauma intimate partner trauma um ... episodes of heroin or these hard things to relive\nNo it wasn't hard to relive and I think but it it\nIt's something that I've held back on\nOffering is part of my showbiz bio yeah um but ... uh you know the respect really is neutral because I really think that she is a superb writer you know when we first started Andrea said you know if there's anything you don't want to talk about we just won't but and I don't think anything ever came up that we didn't want that we weren't both interested in exploring\nAbsolutely and I and I feel like from the very beginning you were very clear one you didn't want me to put you on a pedestal and I'm not super interested in that myself 'cause I don't I think actually when you put them on a pedestal you're doing them quite a disservice like you're not actually treating them as a person and I really think that all\nAll of us needs to be treating each other as a as people because I sort of create community crates compassion ... modeled ways to live and our environments um\nAnd I think that that I just think that's a that's so important I can still be a fan of your work and I'm Still obviously deeply sided with you um but I also\nI also want to see you as a real person and I think that was you know that was pretty vital to the the writing of the biography like best\nI think I think that a Shia Andrea dug into the songs which made me happy there because for me it's never been a boat I'm being a show business personality so much as the content of this\nThe songs which made me happy there because for me it's never been a boat I'm being a show business personality so much as the content of the songs is what I was trying to get across yeah that's why I wasn't so mad at Donovan you know [laughter]\nI Wonder if you get the message out and Andrea seem to be responding to those things in the songs that I had really intended and I felt as though we were both aiming for the same target\n... but there there were issues around that that brings up an interesting point because the the focus on the songs and and the way the record labels and other people in the business didn't want to focus just on the songs or something that comes up a lot in this book some that I didn't know about it I found really interesting you describe\nThe feeling of a lack of creative control over your music especially when it came to your first record label on on on on vanguard you tell me a little bit more about that\n[laughter] well it was a little bit on I mean I had just gotten out of college that are going to India I was playing trying my lock it folks singing and manage village do pretty good yeah that guy records one or two signed me I went to sign with them I almost signed with Blue Note will do the jazz where it's like well by the way\nUm but I went into vanguard and they said who is your lawyer and I said I don't have one they said that's OK you can use hours they signed makes you a seven year to you I mean [noise]\nAnd um you know a lot of the early people in management they ... they just didn't know what to do with me you know they didn't mean to be mean to me or you know a particularly colonial about it or you know any of that\nThey just didn't know what to do with me they\nMany of them wanted me to where you know come up like Pocahontas infringes\nThey wanted to play that you know the most dumped them come from a real New York show business thing we got to have a gimmick [laughter] and they will and they were so they they didn't know some of them were afraid of the fact that I was outspoken I think they didn't know what to do with that they thought that I Would offend\nThemselves or also I wasn't very smart about social things I didn't grow up\nLike in a social climbing environment or in a business environment where the family all has you know they're talking about business at the table and there wasn't a lawyer in the family will judge this I'd never met any of those people\nOver ... party and go drinking after either exactly actor too\nYoung and when you don't when you kind of it's when you kind of you\nKnow I don't know I go home and write [laughter]\nFor me and for me to go to a an after hours by our everybody's getting half cocked and I don't drink at all\nUm I even unintentionally insulted some people I didn't mean to but for instance in ... there was celebrating the in the sixties and they get this four hundred year old bottle of wine and I'd say oh no thanks I don't drink and that's not cool", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "29",

line from public radio international\nWhich goes by here I Am\nHilary Swank is one of those actors who you'll never be able to pigeon hole what I mean by that is she can basically work with any script you throw it or I mean just look at everything she's been in over the past twenty five years there's the next karate kid there's Beverly Hills NATO to winnow the million dollar baby there's PS I love you\nBut why she might be best known for is her breakout role the one that led to her first Oscar shot her into super stardom\nBoys don't cry boys don't cry was released a huge playing back in Nineteen Ninety nine critics praise Hillary Swank performance as Brandon Tina transgender teenager which was pretty groundbreaking roll\nIt was hard to find transgender characters anywhere in film or or TV at at that time but looking at that film now in twenty eight team it is often challenging to see it in the same kind of light\nMay consider the backlash got your hands and faced earlier this year for being cast as a transgender character\nI had the chance to ask Hilary Swank by her thoughts on all of it and a little bit about her new film walk they had which deals with something that every child has to go through at one point or another\nWhat to do with your parents when they get old we talked about that when she stopped by the cue studio during the Toronto international film festival [noise] so I read this thing about you I'm a talker I Want to talk about what they had a I heard that when you\nYou do very simple thing with scripts to help you focus on the character that you're playing is that right you write something on the page\nOh well it's not very simple actually it's really um complex because\nUm it's my character analysis and break down so it's like a type a Bible I thought it was like one line per page no okay I Know what you're confusing I got it so what I Do with the script is um I break it down into one sentence\nThat story the story of the stories about into one sentence\nAnd you're going to ask me what I was this one about but it's it was now over a year and a half ago so I'm not going to get the exact sentence but what it is is I take\nThe essence of this story and in one sentence I'd say what is this story about and that is on the front of my script but then the inside is really you can barely see the lines\nWhat do you do that one line well why do you need to crystallize it like that\nUm because I feel like that is the essence of the story and that everything should lean back to that essence and if it doesn't it usually doesn't make the movie\nWhat what was worth it going down when you were Fifteen Years old live alone car no I don't ever I that was all worth it for me living out on my car was fun I was Fifteen Years old it

in Richmond your industry especially but I mean if you really think about if you say oh tell me about you the first thing I Will say is I'm an architect ... they say what they do yeah and I\nAm and I'm so I say oh I'm an actor you know that that's what I and that's for since I was Fifteen that's what I haven't been doing and\nSo much of who I Am as defined within that and taking time off made me realize that I'm so much more than that and\nUm and\nThere was freedom in that somehow I don't know I don't know how to say and do you think that changed the way you acted well that would also

about these characters in just a second but first you know when he stopped by I I had to kick things off a little bit of a catch up with what he's been up to since he was last here\nHow are ya I'm doing great have you on about being here have you on All right oh I feel good yeah ah this is a new room\n[noise] yeah I should they be listening to the radio were upstairs yeah I kinda wish I could see the older I can go to him yeah we'll go we'll go after and now you're doing this incredible hip evolution documentary\nYeah Peabody Award winning how do you how do you find sitting down with these people the guy looked up to your entire life I'm guessing well again you know what it's like I guess you know what I mean yeah like\nA you know you you sit across from these people in there and they're really fascinating and or their contributions obviously to the culture and the music that that I Love and it's given so much to my life\nUm you know are are remarkable and then uh you know the cool thing and it's the same thing I felt when I was doing you know your job is uh\nIs these people are also stunned as stunned as you are by them they're stunned by what they've been able to contribute and or be a part of so um yeah they're they're super super fun conversations interesting\nHave you had any moment of he can you name the one particular moment of like wow I Can't I Can't believe I'm here right now I mean the\nOne I'd have to say stands out the motives ... kinda recognizes the you know the father of hip hop and uh we have the opportunity to interview him or in front of his building in the Bronx where he grew up in where he kinda famously started throwing his party's in this particular style that you know became hip hop so\nThat was very surreal he's not a guy that's very public he doesn't do a lot of interviews you know so\nTo be with the guy that basically started hip hop at the place where he started hip hop you you know and look at the building and speak to him and hear his story and then kind of gave out at New York and the world\nAnd it all moved to the beat of this music that he has a Thirteen fourteen year old pioneered\nSo I I gotta I gotta think that some of this mhm like getting to talk to each other like either on this show or or or any type of evolution of\nGetting to talk to some of these great mind ... must have impacted the new record somehow [noise] um no it's a weird thing is only indirectly but I'm not in the\nSense of like cleaning anything from there like musical genius oddly enough you know if there's anything that impacted this record I think it's kind of the ...\nI'm not in the sense of like cleaning anything from there like musical genius oddly enough you know if there's anything that impacted this record I think it's kind of the experience of meetings so many people\nAnd meeting them in these particular situations like you and I are in but I mean we know each other so you know when you sit across from a stranger for example and just that dynamic of\nYou know you're coming with whatever you're coming with however you're feeling that day or whatever nerves you might have and they also are nervous 'cause they're about to be interviewed on the radio you know in front of the country or whatever and that energy and what we bring in our posture that we bring to social situations to\nEconomics too political conversations that is basically what this is about so very indirectly well not necessarily indirectly but not in the way that people might think that these experiences of impacted the music but they have impact\nAnd if not like you you you hang out grand master flash for the record sounds like rhyme at exact not like that exactly there's all these things yet but it\nDoes like it's a very unique kind of experience to meet so many strangers into yeah 'cause I always think that the other person is super cool and and confident and ... or strangely aggressive you know what I mean this is what the albums about that what's in your imagination about another human being\nSo you so when someone comes in and you know when you when you'd be in the studio you're doing hip of religion and someone comes in and you haven't been before and they're kind of a big deal to say to someone you know totally and you don't really know them that well in or the you know there aren't that well yeah\nAnd you are scared a little bit yes and they're they seem a little I don't know the grass was the right word well I mean you met before they walk in I'm Out here where we are very seniors out for the worst and a lot of the album is about why\nAnd why why have you have an answer [noise] um well fear you know like I'm but I'm\nLike this question of is it all illusory because it is because how many people come in to the studio to talk to you that strangers and your bracing herself in the worst how many of them actually attack you are like zero percent yet like very yet I'm almost nobody yeah virtually zero percent\nSo then why do we ah approach each other with that posture and not just each other but you know the album is is also political understands why do we approach you know our politics and you know our our financial um um\nSituations also like with with that kind of posture of either defensiveness or or aggression yeah\nWhy why why a concept album at all then why not a song about [noise] um\nBecause actually the first thing they grabbed me was this concept was basically a story that appeared in my imagination and I'm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Yuma", "day": "22",

[noise]\nYou get more time\nMaybe do this this is called ... says lightly just alternative you know sort of create the illusion I'm a no lasting forever [noise]\nOoh\nAnd that's why they say the piano is sort of the orchestra and went when there's an opera being rehearsed and they can't afford the orchestra until the last two weeks of versus those for those other six months they were her sing it they have a pianist is the only instruments that can credibly imitate you know rhythm [noise]\nAnd of course it can do harmony\n[noise]\nHow can any other instrument do that I mean perhaps the guitar in some way I mean it's portable that's a nice advantage but truly it's perhaps the piano that is that atomic level of music plays alone and you are covering all the basis of what music is supposed to be melody harmony rhythm and sound\nSo but when you when you're composing is that's satisfying I only ask because I didn't know when you're in your composition whether the piano can do everything you want it to do [noise]\nI don't think in terms of being a pianist I'm a musician who happens to play the piano the piano is this atomic level of instrument that means that if I Want to conceive of complete music the piano is just the easiest way to do it my best teachers\nThis atomic level of instrument that means that if I Want to conceive\nOf complete music the piano is just the easiest way to do it my best teachers when I was growing up were\nGuitarists drummers they taught me about music how to tell a story through court progression how to leave space what is it to take all the ear of the listener these are all skills that if you are stuck too much and you're instrumental identity\nYou'll never learned and I think it's dangerous I think for musicians to get too caught up in their instrumental identity\nAnd yes there's different you know parts of the body that are engaged for different instruments and every instrument list has his or her own map of music viewed through the prism of that instrument\nBut these twelve notes here in all of western music from classical through to today's pop music these twelve notes have still reigned Supreme you know you walk into a studio where they make rap music you're going to see some some drum machines but you will definitely see a synthesizer which has these twelve notes of the piano\nJust rent dirt on you know the keys are made of plastic and and there isn't an acoustic mechanism to hear those right away but that prism is still through which musicians the music at least in the western world\nI Want to talk more about the conservatory at you set up sort of a musical boot camp in in Paris tells a little bit more about it\nAnd that was a performance boot camp I feel like music was performance for hundreds of years than there was an aberration called recording we suddenly thought oh there's a permanent record which is why it's called a record of a song against which all other subsequent performances will be measured it's kind of terrifying for a musician\nSo I thought how can I get younger musicians who have come up in this SoundCloud era who in a really wonderful way can make music on their own on their computer posted and feel like they're starting to communicate with their audience\nHow do you make sure that in doing so they don't lose touch with what music really was spiritual way music was someone in a cave hitting a drum and someone listening and maybe laughing or dancing\nSo how do you get young musicians to understand that that is not only the spiritual\nWay to feel connected with musicians that came before us but pragmatically that's also where you can make a living as a young musician so I went out of my way to sort of developed techniques that would\nForce them to trust their instincts to create a kind of control the discomfort within which they can compose and perform music\nI've done it once now they wrote music during that week under pressure literally with eggs timers going for ten minutes or Fifteen minutes with constraints\nThey had to bridge the gap between coming from different cultures and different musical styles that was a rapper from Texas to jazz saxophonist from Ukraine classical guitarist from Guyana\nYou had a singer songwriter\nFrom Argentina that we make thing nicknamed Mexican faced at one point or so you had all these people that were forced to make music together look for that common ground\nAnd not have so much comfort that they feel that they have even the chance at perfectionism\nWe had cameras filming almost every moment of the actual work wasn't reality t._v. they weren't filmed in their personal moments but when we were working the cameras were on them and that was part of it they needed to feel that pressure that discomfort they need to confront the fear of humiliation you know when you go on stage you get an adrenalin rush\nWhich is replicating probably early man\nYou know fight or flight response when they might do something like ... are the stakes were very high life or death on stage the stakes are quite as high it's fear of humiliation rather than fear of death if you can make\nExactly and the stakes were very high in life or death on stage the stakes are quite as high it's fear of humiliation resident fear is that if you can make friends with that fear of humiliation and even sort of acknowledge it even sort of let the audience know by taking risks\nTo look like a magic trick a little bit like Houdini saying I'm going to go into this box of water and you know ... ... ... get my way out\nI it is kind of an escape routine every time that you go up on stage you have to escape from the box that you put yourself in are you going to do October third yet what significance of the data to protect\nThat is it dates from I I Can't really explain the details because it's just too private and and so there are things that yeah there's there's things you keep ... yeah I I you know I I Choose what to share with my audience because I Know that if you don't share anything you're missing out on the chance to create a bond and maybe for the music to to have more resonance\nOctober third has been out titled because they wanted people to know that emotionally this piece has different\nThe pieces even dedicated to myself\nI Want people to know\nThis is the emotional core of the album but of course I don't want to say why dedicate yourself yes ...\nYou're you're ... the real neat I dedicated to myself because this is a piece that I wrote on that date where it's something very [laughter] life changing

the CBC right it's always good to come back to the CBC it's always a little bit of a homecoming ah\nI'm looking forward to talking to you about the winners but I Want to take it back for a moment you wrote the secret trilogy which was the literary erotic a huge success it was called the Canadian fifty shades of gray and I love that you had the idea to write them when you were writing Kevin old ghost riding Kevin ... autobiography\nBecause when I think about Kevin ... autobiography I think literary erotica\nI think it's because it was the opposite right um I had been steeped in to business books with him back to back working with him on ... on his sat on his on his box\nAnd I had a wall and uh the editor at the time that I worked with Nina need I Need to ... um basically said you should do something fun next you know\nMaybe the throat of an erotic buck you know fifty shades is doing so well I mean if it's halfway decent will publish it and I I took it seriously as to say I would I Would definitely try that I Would try and I had at that and\nAh and I did I wrote three back to back in Eighteen months to did you did it under a pseudonym yes my pseudonym is actually my manager's name\n'em as el Marie ... Murray Adeline she was born in the turn of the century um quite a sexual prude so it was a little bit of an inside joke between my sister and me and uh uh yeah that was where I got that name so why the student\nAh everybody was writing them under a pseudonym and it was also I wasn't sure of myself I felt a little insecure and I I thought you know if I fail I'd rather fail undermine Anna's name\nThan my own name and it's very it's a very different genre it comes from a very different part of my brain\nUm [noise] um and it was a plot driven and I'm not as sort of literary um it didn't come from the part of my brain that wanted to be surprised so much has wants to nail to sort of plot and the point of making\nWhen it started doing incredibly well was there a point that you were like I kinda wish I use my own there\nNo no no no and I I'm I'm I'm happy that it has its own life somewhere else the romance and erotic genre and leadership um it's a very particular animal they like things a certain way um and I don't know if they'd be a fan of the stuff that I tend to write for myself you know like the winters for instance\nSo let's talk about the winters as we can really see Gabriel her new book the winter's came out this week so I mentioned this off the beginning it's based on Daphne ... Rebecca which was a best seller when it came out in Nineteen thirty eight at the book it's never been out of print Alfred\nI mentioned is the beginning it's based on Daphne du ... Rebecca which was a best seller when it came out in Nineteen thirty eight at the book of never been out of print Alfred\nHitchcock made a movie out of it that won best picture of the Oscars in Nineteen forty what's your personal connection to the original\nRebecca ah it's fraught and lengthy I I'm Rebecca the book was one of three books that we owned growing up we didn't have books in the house we didn't have money we were library people um the other one was one of the other one was um a collection of poems by Alfred lord tennis and\nAnd the chariots of the gods so kind of explains a lot um I didn't read the book until I was in high school so my first introduction of the story with um with Bill Kennedy at the movies out of Detroit I grew up in Windsor and watch that black and white movie with my mother probably on a loop he didn't have very many movies in his collection but he would play the same sort of jumped on pain movies over and over again\nSo I I grew up knowing about the story watching the story then I read the book in high school and was kind of blown away because in the book maxim do winter murdered his wife admits it gleefully ... gets away with it and the narrator loves him more so for it\nAnd I never saw it that way growing up the movie the Alfred Hitchcock ... murder for obvious reasons and so it's a love story\nAnd they get away with it and live happily ever after\nSo let me understand as you're watching the White House you're watching news about the Trump White house you see Hope Hicks a Donald Trump's former adviser and it inspires you to revisit Rebecca my right\nI Would go further back it was really the fall of two thousand sixteen um the actual election itself I was I'm\nNot working I was at home trying to sort of caught my next career move 'em my cat had died oh the election was obviously fought for a lot of women and so I and I and I am a new ...

goes by NPR I\n[laughter] so I don't know how into um literary gossip you are but earlier this year there was a bit of an upset in the book world had to do with the man Booker Prize which is sort of the Oscar as sort of the enemies of literature so the upset was for the inclusion for the first time ever a graphic novel in the list of finalists\nThe book is called Sabrina by nectar now so it didn't end up winning the prize but it did get people thinking about the boundaries we set up between one form or another and why why we feel the need to differentiate between art forms at all and that's something that Catherine ever Matt has given some thought to\nYou see she wanted a governor generals award as a poet and came close to winning his second as a novelist for a book you might be familiar with called the break she writes children's stories and most recently she writes graphic novels\nHer first one came out last year it's called him making more than she is following up with a sequel at the end of November and if you asked Katherine ever Matt how she manages to move between these worlds the institutions like the man Booker or the governor general see is entirely separate\nWhile her answer makes a lot of sense\nThey all are about you know kind of me am I Am all in there somewhere as as we all are an artist and they they seem to coincide like it's a kind of holiday you know they seem to go one after the other like after the documentary the graphic novel feel very close to that because I was working with climate\nThe chronology you know they seem to go one after the other like after the documentary the graphic novel feel very close to that because I was working with collaborators and I was ... ... people who are much more talented than I was\nAnd really kind of directing how things look and I got to do that visual stuff and the graphic novel would you do very very differently and poetry and then pros\nSo those feel more connected and maybe then um say the other earlier stuff\nI find through all the all your work a lot of a lot of it focuses on youth or like teenager years adolescence what what do you find so fascinating about that\nWell I I really started the book of poetry came out when my eldest daughter was I think twelve\nSo I was really kind of coming explain my own adolescence as I was approaching these [noise] these two teenage girls who are about to uh take me through the ringer so a lot of that would be from my girls and from their friends and my nieces and nephews [noise]\n'cause they're really of that era but\nYou really remember the things that happen to you as you're you came of age she really they're very impactful or you as you go forward [noise] um I Know in in studying different like you know education things about the brain and how when we're teenagers we actually hardwired all of those habits\nAre so that we actually do remember things when we're Seventeen a lot better than we remember things that happened say when we're twenty five [noise]\nUm and the way we deal with things in the way we look at life is really made in the course of those those times when our brains are actually forming around our hopefully good habits mostly bad habits when my case anyway\nYou directed a documentary called this river you want a Canadian screening word for it and a documentary tells the story of your brother Wayne and went missing in guide and and maybe the reason I'm asking so many questions about those teenage years because I was really struck that you were to fourteen when he disappeared and like why would why was that the right time to tell the story [noise]\nMy part in the documentary came about 'em really reluctantly I really wanted to talk about a drag the red and the efforts that are going on right now with people who have a loved ones who are murdered or are missing\nAnd then I get through that I realized how close I was to that story and how much I really felt\nUm a kinship to these efforts in and bringing awareness and in some cases in the case of drag the red literally looking physically looking for these lost loved ones I'm part of it was the idea that\nIt's so unfortunately so common in some neighborhoods in some communities that uh no one's untouched you know and during the course of that documentary no one that we worked with I didn't know of or with close to someone who had been murdered her missing and it was being searched for", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "25", "locations": [["Arizona", 34.5003,
