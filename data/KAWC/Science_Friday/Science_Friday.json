I felt that um and just also like looking at the portrayal of masculinity and kind of the way that the whole movie came together around that I thought was a really astute an odd way ... when did you think\nOn a personal level I really enjoyed it for me it's the first person aspect versus just sort of watching it from the outside you could really put yourself in the movie and you know most of us will never get to fly in space so getting to actually experience it in a way I was really fun way to have it movie made\n[laughter] except for throughout the film we see Neal Armstrong as a dispassionate mhm reserved contained and that was all part of an engineering mindset here's an here's a clip\nPlanning on taking ... and the numbers sure what fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal when you take anything a choice I think we're\nI think that's a real quote of as you you ... you know right I did I did I I met him once I'm\nAt a conference so I think you know the movie it really does justices character in a way up by ... I like the movie quite a bit it's a it's a flood movie but it's really great movie I really think this is a movie that captures the other side of the right stuff so to speak to engineering technical backgrounds and the kind of commitment these guys needed to have beyond just be fighter drugs and\nAnd that kind of internal narrative internal uh I'm kind of story in this movie about what it took to be an astronaut\nI think we do is communicated really effective which he has reserved as you went as you knew him and well I didn't really I don't think I knew him that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I think as perhaps a dour as portrayed in the movie\nOr you had a sense of humor he was a funny guy uh but I Do think he had a lot of struggles in his life and as his biographer Jim Hansen has talked about uh [noise]\nUm you know there were some serious problems struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues and ask her own office so you know I think it's a bit of both you was I think he was he was a bit of\nPerhaps reticent but um but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out\n[laughter] you know you didn't get that impression too much into moving\nNot so much in the movie but I think the movie was focused on those aspects of his career in life that record concentration and diligence\nYeah and there's your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like there was a fair portrayal of any engineer\nI engineers have a whole variety of personalities so I think he saw a few different personalities in that movie and if you look across a lot of movies do you see that there's an engineer there is a very serious one they're the ones that are super outgoing so it's certainly a fair portrayal because pretty much every personality type exists in engineering\nAnd one thing that struck me about this film was how jarring and difficult all the scenes of space flight where they had the Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and\nStruck me about this film was how jarring and difficult all the scenes of space flight where they had been Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and it was just disorienting any time we saw people flying a ... a news you'd was that realistic to you\nI think there was a lot of realistic aspects that you know people assume you have this on floating feeling but especially in the Gemini capsule the mercury there wasn't a lot of room\nThat you were really crammed in there the cockpit is right in your faith the control panel so I think that with a very accurate portrayal ... all the switches engages are just right there so that and then of course the rocket ride up till can be a very bumpy so that was certainly true\nThat is going to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday\nAndrew are you there\nOh hi Hi Saturday I think I got disconnected there for a moment [noise] um yeah I was saying it just since you mentioned in the program we hear a lot about mercury and we hear a lot about a but Apollo but I feel like the Gemini program is under served the first time\nMan stepped out into the void and Americans that space walks I think that's a story worth telling\nHey thanks for that call you know I have a lot of people don't realize you know in that scene in the movie where he can control the orbiting the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got the first seat you know to go landing on them oh\nYeah I think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of um [noise] made it much more visible and they asked for an office there were I mean there were other candidates for the job\nBut for sure the gym and I ate experience was a really key point I was a really dangerous mission\nAnd that was just looking up all life magazines from that month and it was widely reported that the time as a kind of really a kind of a an amazing exciting moment in the space race a kind of success or failure in that sense but a ... a fantastic a moment [laughter] captured really nicely in the movie\nAs the one person in the room who remembers that real in real time I can say that it was very very concerning um uh the big emotional punch of the story was Neal's grief over the death of his daughter when she was just two years old\nAnd then the last so the fellow astronauts on the lead up to Apollo you know ... Apollo one whatever how do you think these humans just lost his shaped history has has played out a\nWell I you know I mean these things or if I I think is also communicate in the movie the fighter pilots test pilots were very familiar with losses because they had been at um air force bases and there's many of their colleagues were um you know not making it back home from test flight so\nIn in many ways they were used to it but nobody's really used to last us like that and especially losing a child is something that nobody can really knowing this happened to them\nSupported by visit him of presenting Rio de surveys Abreu fast October twenty sevens from five to nine at desert sun stadium a limited number of VIP tickets are available that include early injury to VIP area as souvenir mugs an opportunity to meet him sees big dean Baba and more information and tickets available at Rio de surveys the dot\nCom in Yuma sunny today with a high of Ninety four degrees north wind five miles per hour\nTomorrow sunny I near Ninety five Parker will have sunny skies and a high of Ninety three today with north when five to ten miles per hour and tomorrow in Parker sunny with a high near Ninety four degrees\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking about Neal Armstrong as portrayed in the new movie first man\nFrom the personal hardships the astronaut overcame to be jarring dizzying process of astronaut training\nTo have that story led to all the missions and since that time ...

Carroll Janice and um you know there are very few African Americans and space exploration very few women\nAnd he was the first African American woman to go into space exploration and not only that she just seems like a like a really cool purse to hang out with I mean she's done dancing and acting and was on Star Trek and she graduated high school at sixteen and\nUm you know insurance that very inspired by the civil rights movement I just feel like she's just all around up really multifaceted fascinating person to do a movie about and I love to be addressed you see something about\nHer or him you're nodding very much in agreement\nOh yeah I may Jonathan ... is very cool I I've met her a few times and it's just always a treat to talk to her about it you can you tell us a little bit about her street on um I I think pretty much what the college that jazz is what I Know of her as a she just a lot like a really interesting life filled with a lot of different\nThings from science to the arts and leisure [noise]\nAh on age I miss having yeah there's certainly a lot of a background um she flew wanting to shuttle flights early ones for ah women and and I think there'd be a really interesting story to tell their\nUh-huh yep so movie I think that would be amazing stories or um you know or like this amazing than it is a treat from a tweet from episode how about the early women astronaut to didn't fly\nOr perhaps what would happen would have happened if they did for something like an interesting topic and there are all these behind the scenes story right\nYeah there are I mean I think um [noise] it that's the mercury ... Thirteen rate I so I I they're I Believe with the ... some kind of Netflix theories about about them also some kind of documentary series that was or regard as\nYeah um [noise] and all the people who were in a control room and all the other places and you know [noise]\nAll kinds of all kinds of stories um interesting ah this this is the movie um about the roads have astronaut certainly fifty years ago and still be fifty\nYears since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter] and we also have Apollo Thirteen\nWe have the right stuff once Hollywood still talking about things that happen fifty years ago with so much has happened since what do you think\nYeah I mean that's a good question I I think part of it that\nYou know Apollo landing on the moon that was that was the big stuff like that was the big stuff that human exploration has has done\nIn the last fifty years I mean that the shuttle is exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting and incredible is like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep wells that people keep coming back to because of that\nUh and that that like I think that there are plenty of storage to be told more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots should should get their due [laughter]\nYou know that's when I when we were talking about this I said they're all those robots we don't hear any stories about the trials and tribulations getting those robots yeah and they're ... and other places ... we also hear about any stories of any other countries in the space for ... there are so many other Asif there's so many countries\nUp there right now I mean there is a story to be told that the tweet about the Russians I think there'll be a an epic story to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're older travails and difficulties and\nThe space dog like uh there's many ways to make her into the story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like\nThe space dog like uh there's many ways to make that are into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those are sort of maybe imagining a kind of alternate alternative to these sort of looking backward movies I think\nMaybe there is something to be said about the interest in space in general but I like to believe we're not just looking back we're also imagining the future is your what are they talking about NASA these days about\nA ... well what are big project is actually trying to get back to the mood so that that the Ryan as the last programs and all of exploration systems ballot meant so\nYou know really I think once we can start flying those flights are there will be a whole nother a crop of uh stories to be told and one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering and how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could figure out how to tell what it takes to actually get\nTo the flight ... for the astronaut to fly on it mhm ... and made to Arizona Welcome to science friday\n... thank thank you my name's Ben and uh yeah I I Would think it'd be interesting to uh make a film about what the challenger accident from an engineering standpoint um they the engineers actually tried to stop a launching a and unfortunately that did not happen\nUm and it in the end it effected them in ways that many people did though of course in fact if she'll be crew but oh\nI think that many of the engineers have a story to tell as well\nThat's a good point yeah absolutely I mean that's a I'm a that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is a plan to make a movie about the challenger mission um but focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nThe decisions made or the day and the ... the day before the launch which were critical will be depicted in some fashion in the movie which were all engineering decisions and uh\nI'm I'm and I'm sure it will be you know a crucial to understanding the accident Mm [laughter]\nYou know you mentioned the Orion mission that wants to get us back to the moon is is it going to be easier because of the lessons we learned from Paul\nIn order to know uh getting to the moon is just as hard today that was in the Nineteen sixties\nI mean we know a little bit more and we have an experience space of one draw from a but actually going to the moon and the the mission is going to be justice risky it's just it's hard to do um the\nAmount of a prop we name when Neal said he wished for more ...

I'm a shanty why she couldn't afford a commercial than she passed because he'd seen them in the market and she said well it's either a Senator Pat or milk and we need milk and from that I'm wary because he's a bit of an extraordinary fellow um spent twelve is\nComing up with a low cost sanitary pads machine that can be money they'll ... can be afraid to fly all the women and there are now four thousand of them all over 'em pulled over the world\nBut the way he got to understanding he had to do a reverse engineering to understand what was in commercial than if you pass because he thought it was just caught and yeah so he decided that the best way to do that\nStanding he had to do a reverse engineering to understand what was in commercial than if you pass because he thought it was just caught and yeah so he decided that the best way to do that obviously was to wake up his own uterus in the form of um a a a goat plaza filled with a goat blood\nAnd I'm Sorry yeah sorry it was a football field with goats slogans blood and he attached it to his clothing and had a little pump\nAnd went around all day and every so often pumped it and so I tried to simulate the experience of a men's dressing woman\nUm he learned a lot [laughter] so I think a lot of men would if they did that [laughter] um\nAnd also because he lived in South India where it's hot he uh he was wearing white so which is pretty much every woman's nightmare and I'm not a ... century pad advertising has told us over the years and so you know there was stains and leaks in east are a lot of time checking behind themselves like women do a lot and um\nHe eventually came understood what was in such pets and\nHas revolutionized synch pets in India quite an amazing fellow\nNews amazing it's a good you know more men should try that a company out the trials and tribulations\nOf what women go ask him with football [laughter] I I think there's so many great little um moments in your book on a little statistics that just jumps out let me go through a few of them you have a staff that every three seconds someone received a blood transfusion\nWow you know the joke behind that is they ought to find that guy and stop him where [laughter] but\nIt's such a ... in the states is that she every two seconds is that right yeah and uh I was given the breakdown of the biggest and idle idle makes sense\nI how how how did this idea of banking blood first come about\nWell what I mean we haven't been this the system that we're all used to which is the mask donation and I'm supply and transfusion of blood it's really not very old a total of about a hundred and Twenty years old\nAnd in the beginning I'm In the U.S in the u._k. they they ... they started in pretty similar fashion that people who are selling that blood um they had this project that they could sell them on and so they did\nAnd it was even a union of blood cell is in New York and other people who men usually who traveled around the country I'm selling that blood so they're with their own kind of blood market um but eventually in the Nineteen thirties uh adult to in Chicago called ... to ... I'm trying to organize things a bit best friend he was\nConvinced that the best thing to do um was to treat blowout as a commodity really so he thought that was when ten must come out and if you use blood you should supplied lots of so he sets up a blood bank\nAnd I know in Chile that transformed I'm In the Nineteen seventies in in the U. S. um the notion of paying full blood um died out and it's now a whole donated not illegal to sell you a blood\nIn the U.S but it's just nice to frowned upon not done\nOne of the you know I when I was in college you know lots of college students who were selling their blood for for money just you know for to have some spending cash\nCan still do that but you you what you're doing is selling blood plasma I'm so you're selling the yellow stuff fifty five percent of\nLiquid in your blood and um yeah you can do that the u._s. has got very very generous regulations that house and you can do that can do it twice a week if you want to know other countries on ... plasma during his do it every couple of weeks but um yeah you can and\nCan do it twice a week if you want to know other countries on ... plasma during his do it every couple of weeks but um yeah you can and the sixty dollars a pop selling a plasma us so yeah it's a good income stream for other people\nAnd now you write that the U.S is seen as the old pack of plasma [laughter] like where do the cartel of plasma\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow picking the breath through your nose short cut deep into your brain ... notice anything different than maybe how the room smell [noise]\nRecent study suggests that breathing through your nose can be linked to improve memory\nAnd that's a note to view mouth breeders out their hair to untangle how olfaction is linked to deeper parts of the brain controlling emotion and memory is Christine is on the professor at Northwestern University Feinberg school of medicine doctors aren't welcome to science friday Hi\nThank you I'm happy to be here we're happy\nTo have you so what is so special about breathing through your nose\nWell a nose breathing is special because it's how we smell and smell is a fascinating and really unique sensory system\nSo evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood of our sensory systems and there are several key aspects of smell that make it particularly interesting and that make nose breathing really different from mouth breathing so for one thing\nThat smell neurons which live up way up at the very top of our nasal cavities\nThey actually touch the air as it flows in and out of our noses just during natural breathing and this is really unusual because these olfactory neurons are the only part of our central nervous system that makes direct contact with our external world\nAnd the way that this information get from these neurons inside of our noses into the brain is different from all other sensory systems so all other sensory systems\nInformation relates through a structure called the ... before it reaches the cortex and higher order brain areas\nBut in the olfactory system information flows straight from the nose\nInto the cortex and higher order brain areas as well without going through the thalamus um and what special is that these olfactory structures are located in a part of the brain called the limbic system\nWhich is involved and emotion and fear learning and memory so this gives a little faction of sort of privileged access to emotion and memory areas in the brain and and because a nose breathing is smelling\nNasal inhalation provide the sort of entry point by which breathing rhythms can modulate brain activity in these structures\nSo just the act of breathing through your nose to nose also since the air is coming in and alerts these this pathway in the end point in your brain to save something interesting happened\nIt yes actually it does so that the receptors inside of the nasal cavity\nOr not only responsive to chemicals so they're not only monitoring ah the chemicals in our environment but they also are the kennel receptors so they can detect the air flowing in and out of the\nThe nose yes um and we found that these natural respiratory rhythm just breathing even in the absence of any smell\nOf drives activity in olfactory areas but interestingly these these respiratory driven brain waves they don't stop there so we found that they also propagate to nearby limbic structures the the\nDriven brain waves they don't stop there so we found that they also propagate to nearby limbic structures the the ones involved and emotion and memory so what this means is that as we breathe\nActivity across the limbic system is rhythmically increasing and decreasing within hails enact sales I'm In this pattern what we found is that it's only present when you're breathing through your nose so if you breathe through your mouth that rhythmic limbic activity goes away\n... you know a lot of us believe maybe erroneous lawyer but you can suddenly smell something that you remember from Thirty years ago right is is that a ... a real thing or why I'm a well for me it's real but why is that something special Tibet sensory Oregon\nUh yeah you know the evidence is not clear that the study is sort of conflicting on that um a couple of studies have found that perhaps olfactory memories memories tend to be earlier I'm not necessarily stronger [noise]\nUm but I Would say there's no clear consensus on on whether or not that's true\n... one of ... what about breathing through your mouth or do anything for you I mean [noise] uh we we use as far as as tasting food we've always been told that you smell the food through your nose and it helps your taste buds taste what which were actually doing is there a connection there\nRight that is true that is a good point um and that's that's what's called retro nasal olfaction so when when we have food inside of our mouths\nUm the air can get from our oral cavity into our nasal cavity but it flows and the backwards direction so it's going out word rather than in word\nUm and it definitely impacts flavors and and tasty us us to talk about\nYour study how were you able to study this I understand that you were able to test this with an F. MRI\nOh actually I'm no that's an and that's a very interesting point um we did not use fmri right because in the human brain the olfactory structures are actually located\nVery very deep almost in the center of the brain and making them very hard to reach noninvasive Lee so we can't record from these areas from electrodes on the surface of the scalp\nAnd functional neuro imaging uh we cannot really measure\nUm brain oscillation with that technique so to do this study we worked in collaboration with brain surgeons who implant electrodes wires directly into these Olympic areas for patients who are undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy\nAnd this provides is a really rare opportunity to record this type of data\nFrom human olfactory Olympics structures\n[laughter] if it falls factoring in memory are related to you see people with memory problems also having issues with smell\nA right that that's a really good point um a lot of neurodegenerative diseases actually do present with early olfactory\nDecline um and well I think are these findings that we're discussing or may not have direct implications for neurodegenerative disease I think um [noise]\nThe impact of of breathing on limbic activity certainly suggests potential new avenues and directions of research on on these diseases um for example it you know it'd be interesting to know if these mechanisms navy altered in nerd degenerative disease um and I I also think\nThat our data point to the possibility that\nBe altered in nerd degenerative disease um and I I also think\nThat our data point to the possibility that neurodegenerative disease could result in all altered nasal breathing patterns I'm breathing it's so easy to measure\nAnd this is something that we are looking into and in the lab to do um patience with different neurological disorders do they breathe differently do they have characteristic nasal breathing patterns\nMove so that's something you know you're going to be following up right yes on ... any neurodegenerative disease in particular\nUh we're we're currently collecting breathing data from patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with Parkinson's disease to see if we can differentiate the two states just by analyzing the shapes of their breeding waveform\nOr are we the only I'm going to just throw this high because I'm really dumb [laughter] are I mean why do we need to breathe through our mouths if we have our noses and are we the only animals a breeze through our mouth\nYeah you know I I really ... watch this and I spent a lot of time thinking about that actually I\nI mean I think the answer probably goes far beyond just the sort of immediate thought which is that if your nose is congested you have this alternate breathing route so that you can still get Erin and still live in one that was laid off and on one um\nBut we're finding that it really drastically changes our brain activity so I think that the full answer to that question really remains to be seen and I think it's a really interesting point I Know that um well most mammals that that I can think of do\nPant and parenting is it's typically something that involves mouth breathing so dogs pant not only when they're hot but I think also when they're stressed uh cats as well and I think that's um something interesting about that", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018",

[noise]\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but about detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nSure yeah I was a there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view that blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the store over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the store like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks on some of the light as well in addition to that uh we try to see\nThe gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of horses pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet\nAnd so that makes the planet wobble around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so sometimes the planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late\nAnd so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on this planet that uh that uh we're attributing\nTo the moon [laughter] hey says no and that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they say out loud\nSo it's an extraordinary claim and there's the famous thing goes extraordinary claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job trying to rule out other possible explanations for this signal\nA question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planted in the system uh that's that's pulling on this planet and making in wobble around a those are all plausible explanation ... uh but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and\nUh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such an incredible claim or it may be incredible is not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm\nIt was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this that you're right very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about this very sure yeah\nYeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event or we observe this system for about forty hours altogether\nSo if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope ah from the surface of the earth so you'd have to stitch together multiple datasets for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh\nThe tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event or we observe this system for about forty hours altogether\nSo if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope ah from the surface of the earth so you'd have to stitched together multiple data sets for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that uh that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the wants to ... is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it could be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope is that I ... a better for you guys were looking at axle plant it's going to be like why yeah if it had been spectacular\nInstrument at the very very large mirror a and a sitting aware as humble orbits the earth\nOr when we performed this observation you know you can imagine humble staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out how a James ... or ... he won't have that problem and like I said the mirror is going to be really spectacular so\nUh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah\nUh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly all the time so we're going to have to have a very good case you know there are downs officer another issue\nAnd I absolutely did the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else I think some law when we shouldn't made it twice as big we've had whatever half sure yeah you\nKnow so there's other telescopes coming down the pike that there are people bidding right now to well that we've talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called ... more than ... ... yeah that's\nA I I don't know who's working on a bed and it's a ultraviolet and a red and optical that's L. O. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so uh they they come up with great uh names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instruments stadium Estee will definitely be an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it ...\nIt is over I tell you this is a strange jar planted situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nThat's a great question and one of the things that I Am always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems we are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here\nAround for another hour on science friday beginning in twenty minutes ear on K.

Scott experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food\nHe looked at bore acts which is a cleaning product he looked at ... which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this was front page news all across the country you were food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hams wanted you know create this poisonous quieter get from the bottom of the food safety\nKnow that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller cameras right he his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also night ten or a preacher\nConductor on the underground railroad during the civil war and he had interviewed his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling and and widely really I mean what was interesting about a month that he took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never\nIt's poison the water gets to the bottom of the food safety\nYou know that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller ... he and his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also a night to enter a preacher\nOn the conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nAnd he had interviewed his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling and and widely really I mean what was interesting about a month that\nHe took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in from the very beginning and then he just starts feeling at a party is feeling the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk people are\nThe more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying we'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that\nUh the role of the government [noise]\nHang on travel golf\n[laughter] but it could take a drink of water [laughter] there you go um [noise] he\nHas this very early sense of the role of the government when we say on the constitution promote the general welfare and this is kinda how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare and your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an Africa as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually did that's the thing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person who drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation\nAt our way we think about food safety so did he actually more and more of their laws created because of his crusade where the Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can be angry\nI Am so after you know he's like battling away stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws pads then one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug active Nineteen oh six passed a somewhat carried by that kind of tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was an and I we've forgotten the ... but that was the first great consumer protection laws\nEver pass by the federal government and so it was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm\nAnd to stand up in that way if you ask why only he would say\nOkay that was a star but the law was immediately weekend by business interactions which it was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished\nI'm only frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished\nHumanities cage WC supported by the ...\nAt the next spirited discussion to learn the story of this remarkable magazine Wednesday November seventh from five thirty to seven at St Paul's cultural center for information visit K.

[noise]\nWell actually so I you don't have to have the cell there's now very powerful systems where he can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test to with no cells at all\nAnd so uh where do you rent truly see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power\nOf biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make therapeutic agents and and and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess weight just\n... I saw on your talk is that I have fun forcing molecules to have sex\nWith Oh yes I Do [laughter] well if\nYou think about ... you have to wonder why nature\nBiology the power biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make therapeutic agents and an end pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess weight just\n... I saw on your talk he said I have fun forcing molecules to have sex with Oh yes I Do [laughter]\nWell if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would divide such a a a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around if you read combined DNA you get progeny\nWe combined DNA that encodes something novel\nShe would get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to ...

of contentious news individual political races Ken we have better conversations\nAbout the issues they get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why\nWe're disagreeing so passionately our guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners are funding in and first one Alex's from Chicago hey ... neighbor\n[noise] hey they're either and go ahead so odd\nDied previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic with that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nOut as a black male you know you might be doing things that contribute to a white supremacist system that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nWomen or being a man who contributes suicide you the systems knowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to to identify as feminists\nUm it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist systems so I'm being able to see the fact that I can still be a male male experiences while existing at I mean that's um and I identify myself and it's such a way really changed my mind\nKnowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicide your systems knowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to identify ...\nUm it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminine system though I'm being able to see the fact that I can still be a male male experiences while existing reminisced um and I did find myself in such a way really changed my mind um and I thought about that\nThat's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening he's you know as part of the problem that we don't see how we others see us\nI think that is part of the program but I think a big problem is that we often spend two don't trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed that he is\nAnd one thing I found very interesting in that the call has experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analogous experience [laughter]\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions do require map it requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect and their their view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\n[noise] I agree I think that logic does not require math but logic is in a way parts of math\nAnd these things have poured boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects the bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me\nWith logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not [laughter]\nLet's talk about some from a current event so it would turn out to the artist topic and current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault ticket and it's a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether that should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process as at plagues and tell me what you mean by that\nWell that's a whole other on a whole lot of different parts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because a lot of people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that just about whether you can be in prison for Thanksgiving things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence buried the paradox because some people say well we have to ... ... someone innocence until that until that proved guilty\nAnd the thing is that if you have an accuser and an acute personnel let's just say that you as a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the mom I'm the woman both innocence\nThe general principle when in fact that just about whether you can be in prison for things and things so going on from the presumption of innocence there the paradox because some people say well we have to put you pick someone innocent until that until that proved guilty\nAnd the thing is that if you have an accuser undone accused personnel let's just say the accuser is a woman on the accused Boston is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation\nAnd so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the man I'm the woman both innocence at the same time because I could just contradiction\nAnd mathematics and civil Sufi have studied paradox his for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting leveled or finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person for the innocent and then we can look up ... will that create for us and what mathematics does all the time it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that world and go what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocent until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can can happen and does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care\nThat so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by false accusations so having a false accusation\nUm would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but isn't free to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we're somehow prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault all the time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo that ... is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot wet people get into arguments in extremes\nOn so many of our arguments at the moment ton device is because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between\nI'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you are making everyone into a rapist or watch one that professor along but said on his book that that we are ... just spin the both will crime as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things that are as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is on straw puffing arguments while you can take that false equivalence\nAnd then you can declare while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying or your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any man jumped by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very ...\nAnd rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things the ... as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is on straw puffing arguments where you can take that false equivalence\nAnd then you can declare while using everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying or your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any man jumped by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\nI'm finally um that the question of knowledge or a ton of hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing law where you have to decide what you'll default position is meant to say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Yuma", "day": "05", "locations": [["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Yuma", 32.72532, -114.6244], ["South

miss Baker was her name and after nine minutes of weightlessness she fell back to earth where she became an instant celebrity inundated with Leathers letters from school children and even the mob at a press conference has\nOne of the first two American animal successfully launched into and returned from space missed bakers flight was a study and how we humans might fare\nIn orbit in space but there's a lot to learn by studying these small cousins of ours right here on earth\nAnalyzing their communications the structures of their societies and the brainy ways that they navigate their world as my next guest says the neatest stone and assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks\nWelcome to science friday I think it's great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my childhood\nAs one of the first animal that went into space wow what got you fascinated with studying scar\nThough I'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in so off I went to um Amazon in Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season\nBut the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them and I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [laughter]\nUm but yeah that's how it all started\nWow a movie so how many do you study how many of the group a number of your study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor two or three groups regularly\nAnd do do do they each have each personality of the room and you give them names like you keep track of that\nSome ... square one of the challenges of working with school monkeys that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram Mac so that's about two pounds there's fifty of them and they are\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor two or three groups regularly\nAnd do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of it some\n... square one of the challenges of working with monkeys or that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram Mac so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise]\nOkay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh they spend a lot of time active uh all day they they're nonstop\nOr they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time foraging in the morning for insect but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of school monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\nFor their practice or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch things pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd out with a head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it\nWow [laughter] and\nI understand they're not afraid to attack a while I'll watch tennis [noise] right why don't why haven't they do that yeah so\nI've only seen adults do it but I've actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low and\nOnce the adult walks desert then that's the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient inpatient [laughter] those wipes for not leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself\nProblem we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of ... of of of the other one of the spider monkey slept let's hear that clip\n[noise]\nI ... I said spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us what we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls I'm so they're basically\nOf all the other one of the spider monkey swept let's hear that clip\n[noise]\nI ... I said spider monkey everybody does it ever is that right yeah okay tell us what we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize Earl\nI'm I Can't recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver so um but when there is you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies have jungles or you know that that that's the sound that we hear is that rises there there's usually this is those squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because square monkeys sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys\nInstead of bird how hard was it how much time as are taking you to know the difference to study this hour they make so it's\nNot something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and knows everything about squirrel monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nAnd how long have you been doing that for a little longer\nHe started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well do you call him a yes\nSometimes he does he like it she loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about the human language for evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey\nSecond hour at science friday's starts in twenty minutes at one o'clock here on K.

years in the wild\nWild oceans they must win back to the coast to one very particular river mouth and then reach ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this well like in\nAny good trip you need a map and not just a compass that's just telling you wearing north is you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight north isn't more north east\nEast and south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded that what if they had long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect\nThe magnetic field lines of the euro their map is they're magnetic\nAnd what about their elastic dwelling cousins and when you let fish living quiet landlocked lives you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain more is Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me you know I just I just said it but but salmon live in principle lives right they travel all that way how many miles to their journeys tech\n[noise] that is pretty impressive and their journey can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds ...\nFan and they usually hedging these really tiny streams mild inland and I have to go back there [noise] that is correct and they don't just have to navigate up steam after find the right stream to go how does he do this and that they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort and\n[noise] you know the sad thing and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reach streams are they generally with their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys in wages they use something more broad scale and then the term we think they're using magnetic nap and they make information\nNow I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon the Atlantic salmon what what makes them so interesting to you\nIn\nThe ... the same and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reached streams uh they generally would use their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and magnetic information\n... now I Know the year researchers looking at a different group of Sam be lapped exam and what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants of individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake in Maine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery\nSo these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and I've never sets in outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\nOr ... and yet you found that they still have these jewel magnetic maps and the that they would have needed that they not been ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these in one\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use in different aspects of the magnetic field especially for a map and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field\nOr also known as my dad field intensity\nAnd so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator\nAnother aspect of the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the pools and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict or favorably\nAre predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them\nSo they're the mechanisms behind lag NATO reception are are still unclear but it's one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species\nHave tiny chains of magnet tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that these chains can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strength and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nThough these structures are thought to be found in the nose and also the latter alliance along the sides of the body of a fish but the men need a receptor itself a is still elusive\nNow why why it important to your wife and why does it matter that they can still detect these\nFields\nIt's a rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that could go to the ocean retain a map sense\nJust to point of curiosity and we also wanted to know um if it lent examine also possess disability it's another group of individuals that does that mean\nSelf uh is still elusive\nNow why why it important to your wife and why does it matter that they can still detect these\nFields\nWell it's a rather interesting question [noise] so\nWe wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that could go to the ocean retain a map sense just to point of curiosity and we also wanted to know um if it lent examine also possess disability it's another group of individuals that\nDoes ethnic maps of diverse amount not amounts of these days\nBut we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic environments one can they even detect the magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nAnd so how did you go about testing reach for though\nThe aid from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were rewritten subsequently tested and so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coil and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire\nAnd when you touch copper wires to an electrical power supply and crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nElectricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that it allows us to alter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\nMhm so what you're doing I Know from my basic physics you know in grade school them if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnifies the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to assure you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nSo we are present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of metal type right that right somehow connect with an herself\nRight and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas\nTo give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials so what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos\nOf our fish and so we take photos\nAnd we assess the position of the fish is head relative to magnetic north\nWow\nThat's terrific guy and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale the main interests with those maps is yeah\nSo what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these two should get\nIn for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale than I Would not those maps is yeah\nSo what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nStory of this remarkable magazine Wednesday November seventh from five thirty seven at St Paul's cultural center for information visit K.

I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they try to do there\nI'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is a tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase a political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns\nAnd their emails those are those are two separate things uh if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nOr we saw them targeting a voter registration database\nI think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of conversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand sixteen warmer there there are a couple of things that we are talking about when we mentioned that one is a tax on the election infrastructure\nBut there's also um [noise] the kind of political purchased a political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things uh if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nOr we saw them targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases are the role that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against 'em or election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which uh manufacturers eat whole books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWas that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there is that something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there are there's a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter]\nThey may still are not have confirmed whether or not they're they're certainly wasn't an attempt to hack them I'm ... and again they manufacture pull books and and a deal with registration databases\nOr electronic pull books or what you kind of what our used they're often or a tablet or art or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said a last I checked I think they have they they may have denied that they were actually successfully breached but at least in one of the smaller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome dinner and it sounded like them or that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromise [noise] well\nI'm I'm well that's actually quite a controversy or questioned him ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped\nUm I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um perhaps to influence the elections ranging from [noise]\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um if we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems\nUm in the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which um where he was just talking a bit about\n'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states um they got attacked there was a voter registration systems um and then they're voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several\nStates um or potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan on paper ballots and if we're thinking about the voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to the DEF CON um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to the death con um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all\nI'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being a retired and then secondly um that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access\nThat in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them um and you would need some sort of inside job\nUm that would require 'em a lot of attention to particular machines and would it be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing because it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of\nBrute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials to ... hour day right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to\nThe my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that\nUm the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election\nWhen they're in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we are doing\nThat um there were mistakes made but a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but\nWouldn't it be great if one could independently verify\nThat the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes in the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking that the machines are right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subjected to the sorts of attacks\nThat we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the states to move in directions to make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI I I could just jump in real quick point um I I I\nI I think there to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but I'm more importantly there's there there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and as an example of that my an obvious example\nReal quick point um I I I\nI I think there to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but I'm more importantly there's there are there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and an example of that might an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nListen for you coming up in twenty minutes at two o'clock here on a double UC eighty eight point nine of them and K.

friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen hundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages in and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point\nThe agreement to ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to agree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the eyepiece he see this week cash shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs that to Kelly the vendors she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much to be with you I Want to send out a shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one and a half degree increase in global temperature oh you were each are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for seven to forty two\nTo break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years as Dr Kelly ... she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much for it to be with you\nOn a certain amount of shot out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one of the half degree increase in global temperature all your worries are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to four to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at science friday I'm so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nBut even at one point five degree increase is going to bring some pretty big change [noise]\nYeah that's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and that was because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference and good for example\nTo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with\nTwo degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer on when you don't have any ice on on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and wild that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses on two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects\nI'm almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me which for coral reefs where the report found that\nOne point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nDoesn't look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay under that to point zero degree [noise]\nSo what the report finds is that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible\nOn there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make\nUnder one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nDoesn't look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay under a to point zero degree [noise]\nSo what the report finds is that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happened\nOn right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even when the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the composition rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about it on to it would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nUm a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but not ... need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew you to report won't go there with that can you can you answer that lead to commission do what they do they use [noise]\nSure so on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists and had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that\nOn the scientist basically is that all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together detail technical analysis interestingly in this case there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators calm make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policymakers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually indoors this report\n[noise] [noise] mhm [noise] ... a lot of people want to talk about it but I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina oh Jana\nYeah fellow so culture and I think what ends up confusing\nPeople when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it what really hurts us in agriculture\nIs the high temperatures for the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced revealed are in the Central Valley of California when tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this was really critical of the or the ...\nFellow so I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up\nConfusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it\nWhat really hurts us in agriculture is the high temperature is the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced revealed are in the Central Valley of California when tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this was really critical of the er the highs not just the average temperatures and fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north American forest grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the to the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more the scientists will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel ...", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year":

C. dot org this has been made possible in part by a grant from Arizona humanities\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the specific guards plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\n\nThink about bees and aunts and spiders tiny as they are in their own vital parts of our ecosystem weather as food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior I think about the term hive mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world\nBut how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful\nAnd can individual behavior still took the hand of faith for the whole group or the hives indeed the legion\nMy next guest looked at these questions how his word is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumblebees and no pitcher woman is an associate professor at UCLA\nLooking at these social behavior of bees ants and even spider [noise]\n\n... what did you know if you ask everybody you they'll tell you that honeybees get all the attention right now but you've gravitated to bumble bee why was\nThat my did my PHD in a honeybee lab and but I went Robie and worked on ... and that's a third of a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and honeybees until I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to only these bumblebees have a very different like psycho right out of the colonies gets started\nFirst honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social uh there's never a point in their lives in a life as a hobby queen\nOr she's living on around the bumblebees are different and they have an annual eat social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerging economy and these queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring IDs clean to have to crawl out of there over wintering thought and start their own that said they spending most of their life living on their own and so even though their social insects and they have queens and workers and\nSo they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though there are social insects and they have queens and workers and that sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary and sex are part of their life cycle to\nYou and you weren't brought him to show us with ...\nI did yes you'll notice from the get go than it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these be groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that anthrax or with social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest away that they live\n... in the meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we tend to confuse the two kinds of bees was having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees at the same and swings my lab actually studies ends um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focused and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forging how different individuals and economy contribute to forging ... home\nYour broker maps with you and John Jarvis harvester from I'm here in California looks like stuff I see on the sidewalk since ... even larger than what you are a little bit longer\nThere but yeah and they don't score sheet and then once you can see on the sidewalk\nAnd well why are you interested in the\n... and the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between nest sites so a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they for it and how quickly they called her friends to the food sales and everything I brought here as in the cast and asked to flip it over I was on its head oh so\nIt looks like that that's a cast of a an an Smith yes you is there like pouring plaster Paris it's exactly faster players from Home Depot\nHow far does that goes around and just the whole life and now that says the top part about six or eight inches long it looks from just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when Kass as his ink um which is a type of metal said when you heat it up like water and food flows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to dig around and break the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it's much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of ... that determines how deep they can go\nTo our house there's so much focus on queen bumble bee is what about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones said that the drone don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because\nThey have this part of their life or they're living on their own and we've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's important to point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this or were those really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or for what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during the larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nNo I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point\nUh but we think that there are probably also factors in order to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from your input start right or were there on the right side yes go ahead please\nUm my um my mom\nIs allergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to 'em like helped her heal her when she gets style\nThat is a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack up first or do you work with ... and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies um\nThat's really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the terrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were done by being me to\nUm those a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the victim and it'd be interesting\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question but no longer and it's also live in big groups where the queen Howard their lives different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of species and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities and differences in first of all many of them live underground whereas bees will and put their hives inside of fame three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example the honeybees in some species of ants will relocate from one site to another is so honeybees will go and look for a new nest site and can the way the shape of the\nEntrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ants will also there is a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places so there's some tomatoes and some differences\nI think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have ... counties that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands in even up to ... million so at least cutter\n... can be up to a million individuals\nAnd just been trying for Halloween I Know that you also started social spider borders social spider\nBeers on the western college

science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the civic arts plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nHow did\nYou sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard\nBut I Am not the only one I can see from the audience said too strict about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great fewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole she'll bang but he's our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules could there be jeans at work\nMy next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep in how well we recover from last week and he's found one of these genes in a surprising place\nNowhere near the brain welcome back tickets\nLast week and he's found one of these genes in a surprising place nowhere near the brain welcome back to tame appalling associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles\n[noise] it ain't\nRight you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is yes for\nUm the majority of long term studies that have looked have found that if you get significantly less significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night than that doesn't work out well for you in time in a lot of trouble\nYeah 'cause I get like sick if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell that is not going to end in all honesty I'm going to fix our crowd myself why do we need to sleep in the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what we do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first star will be considered a short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just maybe up with the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow your memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do\nThose tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects of you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease\nStroke and diabetes and I mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think God genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it will abound sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours the quality what what is one of the genes doing that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is you're not just talking about\nHow genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment so I Would like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works\nI'm from a kind of a lot of research that has shown that genes play an important role and timing sleep\nUm be a time of day you prefer to sleep at the time of day you refer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day recently most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restore the properties of sleep\nThe things about sleep that preserves your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep and improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on now what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep\nAre not in our brains they're not in our heads they're well they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain that are expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study beam all one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which we have\nIn the brain they're expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study be on one has expressed and the majority of tissues in which we have had a lasso bi Moe one is what's known as a clot seen\nYour clocks in every cell in your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as a clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears talk to my students about gives on the ... most of them don't know what collectors are [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time I had the output mechanism that allows you to tell the time\nThe majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulate sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we look primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain\nHow to sleep and more importantly\nHow to recover from sleep loss and what do you mean how to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your terms that are the hit on if it goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep processing works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more if you get too much sleep will go and the other direction\nThe clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature in the evening it sets to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from those so when you say the clock is that the the circadian rhythm we've been talking to the circadian clock that regulates your daily\nRhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down at night um synchronized has a clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock would still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours question over here yeah\nI had a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you are speaking out in the south\nSo napping isn't as a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they ... years now and that all I Do have one or the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles in the afternoon and no one can complain they can write it all I Know what I'm doing research [laughter]\nBut you're saying napping is important is laughing is very important if you're not getting daily suspiciously and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not than getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually what's about recommended but anything from a half hour\nTo an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much and that suggests that they're ...\nAnd you're still napping that goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much so that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine\nIf the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism um especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons sometimes between one of the three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh so I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't\nBlame them either directly right that's why I don't try to understand but that's just me back to where it let me go to the questions on that side yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the day because yes\nAbout two weeks or even nine zero San jose ...\nIf you'd like more information you can reach us a nine to wait three fourths of and six nine zero of service of Arizona western college for more than forty five years this was a double UC Yuma K.

family of four\nThere is a catch though and Exxon wants ... rolled back some other environmental regulations and one big catches that they want immunity from climate change related lawsuit that want damages for these companies because the same deal that the the gun producers have [noise]\nYeah pretty much it's kind of analogous to what they got and it's what other industries have also tried to get a has a complicated relationship with climate change it it's\nBeen ahead of the industry in acknowledging it's a problem they've had researchers who helped author the eye PCC report and yet they are also being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuel years ago and in two thousand they took out ads in newspapers\nSaying that the science was not settled I mean should we be taking this seriously or is it just another\nTo voters across all the taxes and flip the state they're challenging so are the people we don't like let me know so are the people don't like lesbian so

the dot\nCom that's science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of seats actions happening all over the world listen to this worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section now a series of studies in the journal the Lancet look at this trend to see what is behind this uptick what are the effects on mothers in babies\nAnd wanting to vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number\n... for for seven to for eight to five five you can tweet us at ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy is an author author on that land to Siri she's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing\nThank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThank you tell us the land to series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions that must have buried around the world [noise]\nWell it does and\nC section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have buried around the world [noise]\nWell it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over U C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um started socio cultural acceptance that surgery as a normative on thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um\nAccess and a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first it's area and so it's it's it's it's complicated\nWe've seen the rise I'm In a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean\nFor example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and we're way\nOver last talking about over by us there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital and getting the sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there [noise]\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's an accepted norm is part of the culture and in Brazil\nAre there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the problems [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... says area and it's not a low risk um surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and that's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states who are increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and why\nThey're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when a woman really needs it and I think it's important to to stay at at the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI don't want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and watch the sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be vice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology\nAnd why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be vice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr going thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um [noise]\nBut there's also this idea of of planned C section strike the due to do you have to approach this do you ever ... have you seen this in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have a delivery biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the right in there and delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and [noise]\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who makes a recommendation for instance area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nUm it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\n'em the progress during labor in terms of the cervical dial Asian I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy [noise]\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on only Brent delivery unit that might put some pressure on to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that um patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nAnd a highly what's your reaction to the [noise]\nAll I Would completely agree with her the the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time that they're having a ... birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her\nUh her physiology two two best achieved ... birth\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Lauren welcome to science friday\nIra thank you You're welcome ...\nI actually had an emergency thirty why do we um [noise] and I think for that for that but when I got pregnant for at that time I really wasn't given the option of Elbert after\nThat I had to do all of that\nUm is it I said on my though I I look at what they I I look at what were the very end mighty you'd get pregnant and um it really was it was like my provider\nMurray and maybe you've written in the ... and um it really was it was like ... or\n... you want to have the time I was like oh I like that but I wasn't getting their risk and then it it it will make it truly is that um and so I think that um I was able to\nInformation you can contact us at night to wait three and four seven six nine zero\nAnd Parker sunny in a high of eighty seven today north when five to ten miles per hour tonight mostly clear lows

[noise] this\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of seats\nAnd this\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of seats sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr Holly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing or Tony go and vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and a lot a lot of folks on on the line and let's see we only going to take it to everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research mid were free in the u._k. how does the approach the er compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that W World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help\nHelp us look at decreasing says area and and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was associated with improved outcomes increasing including decreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midway free across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest C section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent of birds are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives and then they met that with outcomes and\nUh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it as an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows them they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nTony going you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and try to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary there in a first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor\nThat kind of monitoring called fetal heart rate monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite an accurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd then the last obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people you see a heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing\nDo you test nonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate trade sings using science and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focus on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific modern definition for progress in labor\nOr old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really proved to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definition for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiastic and for the dark and then also some other operations issues for a unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor ... for do if you were only from so phone down here in Boston and so there's this old me now to the to the hospital you go to determines more or less if you'll have a C section or not\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on says there and delivery rates is that\nIf you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another who take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ... percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr wherever tweeter the thrill of it to this and services I have to wonder how much would you encourage her to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that your your your report Holly\n[noise] will ... a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or were wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really um level the playing field in in ... in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one and in time or is perceived to be in time [noise]\nYou're you're ... the main issue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the u._s. ah where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery than necessary and delivery however the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients I'm and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here in the U.S a dummy embarrassment is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length of stay\nYou know it's good to ... in Somerville Mass Hi Sarah\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were at mandated by the doctor due to complications throw chronic disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nAnd um I think a lot of talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section due to my chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like what are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nAs questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know push the baby out that generally and and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions and I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um and different direction slide I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute or Tony are only would I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that\nYou have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... bird census area and are fully fully discussing Tony what about this ... who's charge of sexism\nTheir point well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how a baby is born\nI'm the person who gets birth to the baby becomes apparent uh after that happened um it's no less are no more regardless of what the motives delivery is and sit there and delivery on certainly makes you just as much as a mother on as having a bad time for a", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "19", "locations": [["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098],
