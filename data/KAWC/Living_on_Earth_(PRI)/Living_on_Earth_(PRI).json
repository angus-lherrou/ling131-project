K. gee was very interested in this proposal you know unfortunately the project is currently on hold until more funding comes in\nSo it's like that everybody agreed that people should wear seatbelts but that wasn't enough money for everyone to have one\nUnfortunately that's exactly the case\nAs I understand that there was a system of bullies there to warn people about Saddam is what happened to them\nThat's one of the painful parts of this project um Indonesia supported by the U.S in Germany had twenty two movies\nThat were operating and designed actually to provide a similar data from the ocean floor change in the water pressure in the water column\nBut those do is actually had been vandalized\nAnd we're not functioning and as a matter of fact the Marines survey agency BP T that managed to movies actually cancelled that program because they were not able to keep them operational\nSo the movies had not been operating since two thousand sixteen\nNow what are the advantages of the system that you helped to develop over this now defunct system of bullies\nThe major difference is it is anchored to the ocean floor so it cannot be vandalized and it uses a very interesting scientific phenomenon\nOf the ceremony kind of warm equatorial waters to enable acoustic communication that it's underwater communication where the data is transmitted from the sensors to another communication center\nTo another communication sensor and then picked up and transmitted via cable to land station that transmits the data via satellite\nAnd of course the Quds to communication and the water is what the wells you\nExactly that's exactly right\nSo what it's done has perspective now the Indonesian government changed given this recent disaster\nWell I Hope it has changed right now I'm certain that they're full attention is on the immediate recovery but you know I Do hope that the agencies will reconsider this as a very important part of their overall so now in the early warning system\nThat we've covered it was a professor at the University of Pittsburgh thank you so much for taking time with us today\nThank you it's been a pleasure\nSystems Louis comfort is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh thank you so much for taking time with us today thank you it's been a pleasure ... wall\nOoh\n... archipelago in Norway is rug good frozen landscape near the Arctic Circle it's home to polar bears reindeer and walrus\nAs living on earth explorer in residence marks a lender explains he recently had an up close maybe to close for comfort encounter with a three thousand pound walrus\nA finger of glacial till point since the fjord unsolved bar that put the pin thin point with the ...\nThe place is low but the slowest steep for a walrus and once the effort is made the herd prefers to stay there do not disturbed that is all they want\nThey drowsy and stretch a flipper like an open hand reaches into the air it's just making shadows on her non existent wall scratches the chin the cheek than let's the hand fall\nThe walruses and there are tens and bounds or blending into the land where they recline\n\nOut in the frigid water a walrus had appears to ...

I mean it's a it's a gift beyond description and it was wonderful to be able to be there but I think that everywhere on our cable or people that get to experience the beauty of our sand dunes are low tides of the enormous beaches\nOr the remarkable vision that President Kennedy had ... grade the Cape cod seashore national monument so we're we're very lucky people and uh\nOur history goes way back obviously made everybody during the Arab Seventeen hundreds Eighteen hundreds early sixteen hundreds came here on a boat\nAnd we have always had a tie our history to the sea and in our merchant efforts or the China trade the caught on top of the state huh cod wailing or and\nYou know we don't have cod though I mean this ought to be a message to everybody it's Cape Cod that they're no God or very very few and precious few and it's a it's a tragedy if we don't start paying attention to how we manage these kinds of things we could see an economic impact on our state\nSo what do we need to do today to take care of our oceans I think there were three primary\nChallenges a number one climate change which is caused by greenhouse gases which fall in the ocean and the ... the ocean\nWhich has a negative impact on the growth of clams crustaceans shells and bleachers out spawning grounds and coral reefs and so forth around the world are we don't know all the impacts we know it has an impact we don't know the rate if in fact we don't know where you could have a precipitous catastrophic\nImpact and so that's why we all at particular respect and concern the second grade impact is pollution general pollution\nPeople build that bill near the ocean there is what we call non source point pollution\nYou I've run off the of gasoline runoff from stations you have oil run off you have pesticide runoff you have high nitrate runoff which affects the level of oxygen in the water and therefore the fish and plants and Fonda in the ocean\nAnd we have five hundred dead zones around the world and the ocean's today dead zones nothing grows because of what has happened with this overload\nAnd also pollution generally it affects the fish you have plastic getting in the marine mammals are into birds I seen film of a shark send or ... or whales dragging net surrounding dragging plastic around it's crazy\nAnd then finally we have over fishing\nWe have too much money chasing too few fish and that's one of the reasons we don't make cod anymore here\nEight of the top fisheries of the world are now over fished out of the sort of Eighteen or so fisheries principal ones and the others or at or near max so with four hundred and fifty million Chinese who've come out of poverty into the middle class\nMax so with four hundred and fifty million Chinese who've come out of poverty into the middle class who now have discovered blue tuna and sushi\nOr with four hundred million Indians likewise and people around the world gaining in income and then therefore appetite we have a huge challenge and already about drugs and the protein that people get the world comes from fish\nSo there's a huge demand for fish is food stock and increasingly we're going to say pressure on that so those are the Big East but the pollution is just stunning I mean if we continue at the rate we're going there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean and twenty Thirty years\nNow of course you've had a storied career most recently as a diplomat and your background I think you spent some time in France and Switzerland as a kid and your dad was a diplomat\nBut when it comes to the ocean you've had some special concerns and I just want to quickly ask you about ... to one there's something called the law the sea treaty with something that the United states and the folks from Massachusetts like Eliot Richardson worked on years ago which we never ratified and now there's talk of having some sort of a high seas treaty\nUm that would govern what is half of the world is not in any just\nTo correct It's called the high seas and the high seas do not belong to any particular nation\nBut they get egregiously overfished by renegade fishers pirate fishermen and years ago Senator Ted Stevens and I went to the United nations to try to ban the drift net fishing\nWe succeeded it was banned but today you have pirates fishermen renegade fishermen who go out with addressing at the drift net is literally thousands of miles a model filament netting that they dropped behind the boat drag allowing it kind of strip mines the ocean\nAnd as much as two thirds of the catch\nCertainly fifty percent is called waste cats they just throw it overboard so it's changing the ecology of the ocean by imagine if the vision of a you'll see a strip mining coal or in the land you see it just ravaging everything around that this is what address and that will do\nAnd then sometimes it breaks off\nAnd it becomes what we call the ghost in it because it just fishes on its own when it's weighted down with carcasses it sinks to the bottom scavengers clean it off it rises to the topic again\nUntil it gets tangled in a whale or tangled in the propellers of some boat it's a scourge and we have no enforcement on those high seas or very little enforcement I should say occasionally someone's military ship goes through it and you can check on who's who and what's happening and you can certainly mark what ships are they're fishing\nSo we're over fishing talk to me about the climate and your concerns about climate change\nFace a massive challenge of dealing with climate refugees the prime minister of the Fiji Islands I I just met with them the other day at an event in California where he pointed out that they're literally taking refugees from other islands\nAnd they themselves are now planning how to move where can they go to be safe\nThey'll lose their nation state which is these islands\nIncreased fires increased floods more moisture in the air because of the warming of the ocean more intensity and the storms because of that moisture we're seeing it in a hurricane's we've seen last year just three hurricanes Harvey Irma and Maria\nCost the taxpayer two hundred and sixty five billion dollars one third of the defense department budget for here think of that three storms and it's going to get worse so people who sit there and say well we can't afford to do something or we can it's crazy it is far more", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Living on Earth (PRI)", "city": "Yuma", "day": "09", "locations": [["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Tennessee", 35.75035,

the journal of the American Medical Association has found what many people have long suspected eating organic food appears to reduce the risk of cancer\nAmong some sixty nine thousand people tracked by French scientist over several years those whose diets contained more organics at about twenty five percent fewer cancer is overall with thirty five percent fewer breast cancer as an older woman in a more than Seventy percent reduction in them focus\nThis study suggests but does not prove that pesticides and other chemical residues in foods cause cancer but there's no reason to wait for more research when it comes to making food choices advocates say including the president of the environmental working group can cook Ken welcome back to living on earth thanks Davis great to be here\nSo when this study came out that showed strong evidence in support of the long held belief that organic food is better for us how do you feel now that the study is out there\nWell you know I guess I feel as if we should have been doing studies like this a long time ago we really do need to be much more careful about the low levels of carcinogens that we still have in our diet the fact that several cancers here\nDid show or a market decrease to me tells me the organic food is probably targeting the mechanisms that are associated with those cancers and the other thing that's interesting\nWhile they speculated about pesticides there are other chemicals in non organic foods that are not allowed in organic certain chemical dies a certain color rings a certain flavorings that simply are not allowed in organic food manufacture\nThat in addition to pesticides may be another reason why there's lower cancer rates amongst these are mostly women who are eating more organic food\nAnd of course if the product is made from genetically modified organisms it's not allowed to be labeled as organic\nThat is true as well and there really are not very many chemicals that are allowed in organic manufactured are packaged food\nCompared to conventional where there are thousands so there are lots of questions raised by this study but to me it goes back to the basic point a cleaner set of ingredients closer to nature fewer additives less processing is probably in general\nThe basic point a cleaner set of ingredients closer to nature fewer additives less processing is probably in

attorney were charged was damaging the Enbridge crime wise unprepared to mount a climate necessity defense\nWhen October ... in the middle of the trial or Minnesota George abrupt we're quid them of all charges and they joined me though from Seattle, Washington welcome to living on earth thank you thank you very much Dave\nHow does it feel to have these felony charges thrown out on a\nI think we all have mixed feelings about that I've been feeling guilty with you know happiness that we are not going to jail and quite frankly that I'm off bail and may have the opportunity to do civil disobedience again because I\nHad to be very careful while out on bail because if I got arrested it could be revoked and I could spend all my time in the Clearwater county jail awaiting trial\nBut um you know we're disappointed that we did not get to put on the climate necessity defense that we wanted to with you know the very well\nRespected experts that we had lined up to testify for us like Dr James Hansen you know former climate scientists from NASA and Bill McKibben so it's a mixed bag Emily\nYeah I I'll go being stronger about it than that and say that you know I was really heartbroken not so much by the acquittal of course which is a good thing it was sort of second best scenario we could have had\nBut by the denial of our expert witness testimony on climate change and on civil disobedience you know it would have been the dream trial it could have made a really big difference\nSo that thought that this kind of trial might happen in that courtroom in front of those jurors and that might make set a precedent that would really have an impact nationally on the climate change debate seemed like a really important thing to me and of course until four days before trial began it looked very much like it was going to happen\nSo you know it's it's a real shame that that it did not\nKnow as I understand that you heard of the judge to let you use the necessity defense\nYes and he had granted that to us back in October of twenty Seventeen and in fact he had copies of our expert witness list for for about the last year and a half\nSo at any point in that time period he could have constrained us constrain the number of witnesses said you can't talk about this or that and he chose not to so the fact that he did that for days before trial began was stunning at the lawyers who couldn't have been more surprised we couldn't have been more surprised\nUntil that moment he'd been very very reasonable and it seemed like all systems will go and to be clear the thing about that that was so striking apart from its sudden it\nWas the fact that normally speaking defendants do not have any burden of proof it's it's the prosecution that has the burden of proof normally\nBut because we were going to use a necessity defense and say that what we did you know was essentially a new necessary under these circumstances that we find ourselves in to prevent the greater harm of climate change we did have the burden of proof and all of a sudden he knocked out our ability\nTo defend ourselves essentially because who is going to listen to a poet a retired lawyer and a software engineer from Seattle\nOn climate change you know we're not scientists we have no authority so no matter how articulate we had been\nIt wouldn't have had anything like the same impact as the former head of the NASA Goddard Space Center talking about climate change and how urgent it is or about Minnesota scientists talking about how urgent it is and how much is already changing in Minnesota\nSo you know again we had no ability to defend ourselves without experts to testify to those things\nAnd the software engineer your co defendant was\nThat was ... a young father of three who was our support person or support people were all arrested they went in knowing that that was a possibility but it was certainly our hope and we're planning the action that they would not be arrested\nSupport people were all arrested they went in knowing that that was a possibility but it was certainly our hope when we're planning the action that they would not be arrested so we're very very happy that he's acquitted and home with\nHis young family were happy that he's acquitted but I personally am very sorry he didn't get to testify you know in the necessity defense hearing a in August a year ago when he testified there was not a dry and they're um\nYeah when he talked about his young children and what they were facing\nAnd then the case becomes even more confusing I guess because the judge shows in the one hand you can have witnesses to make your case and then he proceeds to go ahead to quit you of the charges\nRight that was after the prosecutor had presented his case which was only two witnesses the sheriff who arrested us and local Enbridge employee and all he proved was that we had broken some chains that were holding the log\nInto the enclosure where the emergency shut off valve was and we never disputed that\nSo we were charged under a statute which was one of the sort of enhance penalties statutes that are being shoved through state legislatures right now by the fossil fuel industry to give them you know further penalties against protesters\nAnd the statute we were charged under was specifically damage to pipelines and the judge ruled and he was correct that the prosecutor had not prove that we had damaged a pipeline in any way\nYeah and ... who is essential he wasn't really that there wasn't evidence for a reasonable jury to convict us basic right ah it as a matter of law and that was because of course we hadn't damage that by flying right\nI'm going to sue to speculate about both of you in a ... about judge Robert Tiffany and the decisions that you made in your case how do you think the judiciary might have been influenced by outside forces politics sentiment the fossil fuel industry\nThis is Emily in terms of you know what kind of pressures he may have been under or what he may has been I'm thinking you know whether his mind might have changed\nAbout what kind of precedent he wanted a sad and so forth you know it's it's impossible to know and and it's you know distressing and it certainly something we've been wondering about he seems like a very reasonable guy he gave us a necessity defense he wanted to hear what we had to say and he wanted to let the jury hear it so you know they by faceless quite extreme\nWe know for sure that Enbridge provide something like two thirds of the budget that county so I you know they obviously have some influence direct or indirect we don't know I mean we have no way to know what may or may not have happened behind the scenes but\nThe fossil fuel companies have terrible amounts of influence and power in this country and you know that's why we have to fight them and the ways that we have to fight them because they do on and control our political system all on all levels\nTo what extent do you understand what are you did this direct action the law enforcement could bring Sony charges against you know\nAbsolutely knew that that was not only a possibility but of strong probability and we accept that risk\nI personally feel I'm sixty six years old and I feel that it is my job as an elder and it is my job because I Am an old white woman who has the privilege of not having the cop show

series looking at how Puerto Rico was recovering after Hurricane Maria laid waste to the island in September of twenty Seventy\nWe've looked at the resiliency of the corals before the drinking water system and the people themselves now living on her body to ask them checks in on the farming sector she went to Puerto Rico nine months after the storm but some small farmers who lived through it and we're still working to rebuild\nEven before Hurricane Maria uprooted trees and people Puerto Rico imported roughly eighty five percent of Its Food after the storm that number shut up to Ninety five percent imported food if you could get it many people are forced to skip meals and each shelf stable and canned food for months\nNine months after the storm one of the only places to find locally grown food on the island is farmers' markets like the Saturday market and ring tone and Puerto Rico's what have\nYou on a dinosaur kill dinosaur kill how's that Sunday\nCarlos nearby farm is slowly recovering storm today she's brought pineapple a pie a mushroom and account she's explaining to a customer\nNew supervisor view on both of them I like to which the single little for three to five I think um [noise] I'll say those are not one of the things you suddenly as\nBrave smile makes our natural sales person says pretty it's a good time to be at the market right now\nSo that things are just starting to turn around for her family and the farm they're finally harvesting again and her farm to table restaurant sana open just a few weeks ago\nBut Hurricane Maria was devastating for them the storm destroyed her home she had to send her three children to Florida to live with family while she and her husband living in their car rebuilt the battered farm\nWell we got really trashed on of our production for years of tropical trees like mango trees and passion for cheese they all died and they all would learn way we had a cheese that were a hundred years old and I you know totally perish\nJust a hurricane will decide to own it brought some salt water and um some fan with it so everything that was going to pass it looked like it through herbicides\nAcross the island tall for cheese for the most heavily damaged food crop\nRoot vegetables that could hiding underground did OK grass plants like pineapple were among the first to recover and fast growing vegetables like salad greens are easy enough after the hurricane visitors came to Puerto Rico with our suitcases full of seeds to donate to farmers Sonya says they actually put it\nYou know totally perished since the hurricane was assigned to own it brought some salt water and um some fan with it so everything that was going to pass it looks like it's through herbicides\nAcross the island tall fruit trees for the most heavily damaged food crop\nRoot vegetables that could hiding underground did OK grounds plants like pineapples were among the first to recover and fast growing vegetables like salad greens are easy enough after the hurricane visitors came to Puerto Rico with our suitcases full of seeds to donate to farmers\nSonya says they actually started growing again relatively quickly\nBut we still don't have electricity we couldn't pump water out and we didn't have any gas so it was we were able to grow food because we have gas to pull out the water from the water pumps and we just\nYou know trying to scrape up any anything waiting ten hours for guys just grow food and it's very uncertain\nGrocery stores are open and got on the island but visit a grocery store and Puerto Rico and you'll be hard pressed to find anything supplied by local farmers I went shopping and Amigo chain grocery store which\nIs owned by Wal Mart\nThe bears pineapple from Costa Rica coconuts from Dominican Republic\nHoneydew melon from Guatemala [noise] overhead is more of a watermelon Trump supporter I found some watermelon from Puerto Rico isn't one around that are already cut up into pieces the whole watermelon came someplace else [noise]\nTo understand why this lush tropical island with year round sunshine and rain imports nearly all of Its Food you need to go back to the Nineteen forties and the U.S initiative called operation bootstrap\nWould the colonization of the U.S there was a movement to get people out of their farms and into the city is\nA ... my shell is the documentarian for the resilience funds in Puerto Rico\nScientists focused on how divergent species inherited characteristics that genes were passed and sometimes mutated from one generation to the next\nWell we know life can be complicated so we should not be surprised that evolution is not just based on the tree of life and inherited genetics\nWe learned in the Nineteen seventies that there are creatures that are kind of in between single celled bacteria and multi cellular creatures like human a category of life called archaea that could hold the key to how life got started on her\nAnd out scientists discovered horizontal gene transfer which changes genomes by a sideways infection sometimes across species author David Quammen tells the story of this new understanding of evolution in his book the tangled tree a radical new history of life\nDavid joins us from Bozeman, Montana welcome to living on earth thank you Steve very good to be with you so what is the story that you set out to tell\nWell it's the story of the tree of life as the image of evolutionary history on earth\nWhich goes back to Darwin and the way that image that tree has been radically challenged and radically revised and the last forty years because of discoveries from genome sequencing\nA kind of evidence that Darwin and most biologist in the twentieth century didn't have and those challenges have been astonishing counter intuitive and have reshaped what we thought\nThe story that you set out to tell\nWell it's the story of the tree of life as the image of evolutionary history on earth\nWhich goes back to Darwin and the way that image that tree has been radically challenged and radically revised in the last forty years because of discoveries from genome sequencing a kind of evidence that Darwin and most biologist in the twentieth century didn't have\nAnd those challenges have been astonishing counter intuitive and have reshaped what we thought we knew about the history of life on earth\nTo summarize I think it's fair to say a big takeaway here is that what we think of as species what we think of as individuals and for that matter the whole tree of life where evolution show species neatly diverge increments origin well not exactly right why is that\nThat's putting it politely I said at the end of the book after having told these stories of these people in their discoveries that this whole\nRevolution has challenged three categorical ideas and that's the idea of species the idea of\nIndividual and the idea of the tree of life the idea of a species that it's a unitary thing it's a population of creatures that are similar to one another and they injure breed with one another and only with one another\nThe idea of an individual there is an individual named Rufus the brown dog there is an individual named Charles Robert Darwin there was an individual Steve Kerr would David Quammen\nAnd we are a unitary in discreet and thirdly the tree of life represents the history of life on earth that is a tree shaped history and it turns out that all three of those ideas this categorical Z are wrong in important\nWays you know it's tough for a moment yours is a story of people a scientist trying to understand life and how it has evolved pilot continues to evolve tell me about some of the characters in your story especially car was\nMm yes so I came across this fellow early on in my own discovery of this subject Karl Rove and microbiology at the University of Illinois who came out of nowhere and suddenly in November third Nineteen Seventy seven\nAppeared on the front page of the New York times above the fold picture of him and a story about his discovery of a third kingdom of life on earth the separate form of life and was unknown to exist before that\nBefore that we thought they were basically two kinds of life bacteria and everything else bacteria were simple cells everything else was composed of complex cells would sell nuclei animals plants fun guy humans\nAnd ... came along and said no wait a minute I've discovered a third form and that was the beginning of a sequence of discoveries that he essentially triggered that have led to this new understanding\nAnd by the way what was that he discovered what was between bacteria and multi cellular organism\nThere was a group of organisms now known as the archaea archaea as in archaeology suggesting old because it was thought that they were the oldest form of life on earth maybe\nThese were creatures that had been taken for bacteria for decades and decades ever since people started looking microbes through microscopes they thought that these things were bacteria\nWas started sequencing their genomes and lo and behold he said no these things are not bacteria if you look at their genomes they're not only distinct from bacteria but they're more similar to us to humans to all animals to plant than they are to bacteria\nBut they were the oldest form of life on earth maybe these were creatures that had been taken for bacteria for decades and decades ever since people started looking at microbes through microscopes they thought that these things were bacteria\nWas started sequencing their genomes and lo and behold he said no these things are not bacteria if you look at their genomes they're not only distinct from bacteria but they're more similar to us to humans to all animals plants than they are to bacteria\nThey are radically distinct and so he announced in a scientific paper and the press announced in headlines that he had discovered a separate form of life a third major kingdom\nNow by the way about this kingdom the car was discovered these are pretty tough characters are aren't they they're they're they're in hot spots very extreme temperatures that sort of thing\nWell these creatures the archaea at first they seemed to live entirely in extreme environments as you said um hot springs in Yellowstone Park thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean highly acidic environment more and more as scientists discovered ways to sequence DNA just out of the wild\nThey have discovered these creatures live in a lot of different environments not all of which are extreme but one of the groups of extremity loving our kids\nLive near vents at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean almost ten thousand feet down between Norway and Iceland and those are ... are called low key archaea and it's now thought that they in fact\nAre the descendants of our original ancestors that we all complex creatures grew out of an ancestor that more closely resembled one of those one of these are key and living in a fence at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean\nThan having come from anywhere else but those are how to put it there are the descendants of our ultimate ancestors that we come from archaea and not from say the bacterial side of the tree of life\nThen raises the question maybe they came from someplace else because if they're really tough ... they might have survived interstellar space\nYou know that's why NASA funded car was his work\nHis original funder when he discovered the archaea one of his funders was the national aeronautics in space administration why because they thought that his work might shed light on the problem of XO biology\nThe possibility of the existence of life on other planets other star systems other places around the universe\nTell me a bit more about Carl was the man\nWas a biophysicist he was trained to\nAt Amherst and then at Yale in ... physics that was his PHD and then he went to work for the general electric labs in Schenectady New York they hired him as a research molecular biologist and he really had no idea what they wanted him to be doing he sat in a lab in Schenectady for a few years new to linger around\nAnd trying to make some important discoveries he was always interested in pure science in the deep questions what is the shape of the early history of life and the history of life since then\nEventually he was hired away to the University of Illinois where he could be a cranky crunch the professor that didn't spend much time with undergraduates he was a terrible lecture\nHe was reclusive you didn't participate in faculty committees he was just this brilliant grouch\nWho could be wonderful to the students could be a sign generous mentor but couldn't\nInterested in pure science and the deep question what is the shape of the early history of life and the history of life since then eventually he was hired away to the University of Illinois where he could be a cranky crunch the professor that didn't spend much time with undergraduates he was a terrible lecture\nHe was reclusive you didn't participate in faculty committees he was just this brilliant grouch\nWho could be wonderful to the students could be a sign generous mentor but could also be this total reclusive grump a complicated man with different sides to him which is\nPart of what attracted me to him as a character is a central character the book the other thing that attracted me it was and\nI quickly saw that he's probably the most important biologist of the twentieth century that nobody has ever heard of so\nOne could say that convergence is a major theme of your book and of course than the Darwinian tradition wear jeans past vertically from parents offspring we'd draw trees to represent this movements in the limbs on a tree only diverge from other branches\nBut David if the tree of life is not actually a tree how might we best described evolution based on what you've researched and written about here\nWell some people say we should think of a Web and not a tree of life because as you say convergence is very very important a network of life one fellow suggested the circle of life\nAnd yet the tree is still mostly right captured some big patterns but there are exceptions to those patterns the tree image was valuable to Darwin and the people who followed him because it represented the divergence that has occurred\nThrough the history of life one lineage diverging into two lineages one limb into two branches et cetera and species diverge him from one another all of this divergence that led to the diversity of life that we see on earth now\nBut it's not just a matter of divergence the discoveries that flowed from from what was his work and his methodology including things like the prevalence of a phenomenon called horizontal gene transfer genes moving sideways across boundaries\nThose represented convergence and so the real history of life is a history of lots and lots of divergence complicated by a lesser but very significant amount of convergence genes moving sideways", "show_name": "Living on Earth (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "02", "locations": [["St Louis", 16.01793, -16.48962], ["St

slash cancer care\nIt living on Earth I'm Steve her with\nHurricane Michael quickly blew up into a devastating category for storm as it entered warm waters in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico it's yet another example of the increasing number of major weather events linked to climate disruption\nAnd according to a recent report from scientists with the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see we can expect more and more dire events such as Michael was only seemingly small increases in the globe's average surface temperatures\nThe twenty fifty in Paris climate agreement called for no more than a two degrees centigrade increase from pre industrial conditions and suggested limiting the rise to one point five degrees will be beneficial\nBut this new report finds that have to agree different poses huge risks\nKeeping below that one and a half degrees centigrade goal is going to be tough but the impact of failure will be even tougher says Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer professor Oppenheimer has been a lead author for high PCC reports for years and joins us now welcome back to living on earth Michael go ahead to be here again\nBecause of the chase how scared are you by this latest report from the IPC see\nI don't get scared about this issue because I've been living with it for thirty five years and uh if it scared me I Would have gone crazy a long time ago however any sane person would take away a very very sobering message upon reading this report\nThe effects of climate change are already here\nAre projected to worsen over time and the point at which the risks are related to climate change that is the possibility of very big impacts starts to increased markedly is not\nToward the end of this century but very close a matter of a decade or two away if we do nothing or more or less nothing like we're doing now to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing the problem\nSo what's the basic premise of this report it and and why was it issued in the first place\nThis report has an unusual origin the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change produces far or with that's been said all our knowledge on climate change\nEvery six years or so and then in between those major assessments that produces very quick and pointed assessments of pieces of the problem\nFor instance I'm working on the next vehicle special reports that I'm working on the next special report which is on the oceans and the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets the report that just came out is on the question of\nWhat is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high that we may just as a group of society is not be able to cope with it\nThat's unusual because it's pointed at a single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest IPC report\nIn the end the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets the report that just came out is on the question of\nWhat is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high that we may just as a group of societies not be able to cope with it\nThat's unusual because it's pointed at a single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest IPC report is that we have just a dozen years twelve years or twenty thirty or so to get our act together to reach a net zero output in carbon emissions to what extent do you agree with that finding and how do we possibly get there\nTo be Frank about it I don't think we're going to get there and I also think that partly because of that\nThe framing that we have twelve years left or else is wrong it's counterproductive it'll just scare people in the report than frame it that way that's been a framing that the media has has put on it\nIs sort of like twelve years ago we don't do what we should do the world comes to an end that's not the case the reality is at every step you do the best you can if you don't quite make\nThe target you try to do a little better in the next decade or the next couple of decades the world doesn't come to an end cause that is the risk just increased markedly and it becomes very very hard to cope eventually\nThat doesn't mean that society's will completely disintegrate some well I can tell you that sea level rise is going to destroy some coastal societies particularly on small islands states but it will make life just miserable expensive\nAnd uncomfortable for the rest of us\nSo what are the biggest challenges in this report or in terms of lemonade warming to a degree and a half centigrade\nContrary to what most people think of the report finds that the challenges are not primarily technological\nThe costs are going to be decreasing overtime although they're never going to be entirely negligible but the real obstacle is a social and political one\nHow do you get societies organized to actually reinvent themselves to be not independent of fossil fuels\nYou're saying the primary challenge to limit warming to one and a half degrees centigrade is us what impact do we need to do than as society is as governments to to limit this morning I I Know there are many many aspects to it but but briefly what do we need to do\nThe most general level what we need to do is abandon using fossil fuels as primary energy sources that means\nGetting rid of coal the primary source of carbon dioxide from electric power production for instance as soon as possible\nReducing end eventually eliminating our dependence on petroleum based products like gasoline primarily for transportation and probably the biggest challenges that there's so much carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere\nThat even if we slow down markedly are ... and ... eliminate dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get toward mid century\nIt seems we go in and need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nWe slow down markedly are ... and ... eliminate dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards mid century\nIt seems we're going to need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nPattern of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use so tell us why two degrees centigrade will be even worse than they already ambitious goal of one and a half degrees centigrade why does just half a degree make such a difference according to this\nParticular report so\nWhen the report was called for two thousand and Fifteen a lot of\nScientists were skeptical that there would be much of a difference in the impacts between one and a half two degrees but because the government's call for the report a lot of scientists went out\nAnd started doing a research focused specifically on the difference between one and a half to two degrees it's become clear that particularly with regard to extreme heat\nOff somewhere in the open plain beyond the trees now at last the lions begin a deep puffing cough\nRule rural or is\nIt is hard to figure out exactly where it's coming from and that's the point of it only the lions and the lion has says now\nAnd the hunted in their panic will

R. G.\nI began the second part of our talk by asking Secretary Kerry they consider the issue of stranded assets as it applies\nTo climate change let me ask you just to think reflect on this for a moment looking at American history in Eighteen sixty\nIn the south there was more monetary value in slaves\nThen there was in the land or Eighteen sixty five that was a classic stranded asset all that value disappeared to what extent today do you think we're being held hostage by folks who think that all that fossil fuel in the ground which is on balance sheets and billions and billions and billions of dollars\nAnd it can't all be burned if we understand the science correctly to what extent are we headed down a path I mean to solve the problem we had was slavery I mean there's the moral question there just like we have today with climate as well as the economic question to solve that problem we wound up in a pretty in a very bloody war\nYeah idle at I mean I don't think that's the choice for for America now I think that I think uh most of the executives I Know at the higher level of the oil industry are all diversifying\nA Shelby pay their all investing in New energy they're ready to move where the market would go and uh\nI mean we're not going to be able to transition fast enough that you suddenly dry up and not have oil or gas and Bob there's going to be oil and gas for a while it's just the nature of the beast we've got to try to guarantee is not for to allow him\nWhy I'm simply listening to the scientists I mean I'm listening to the un and understanding the science if we don't move off fossil fuels fast enough\nWe could reach what's called a tipping point\nWhere things begin to cascade down words in a spiral of destruction and dying of dying sees dying trees dying species of various kinds because it's not sustainable\nAnd if you get into that kind of a spiral nobody knows nobody can tell you how you break out of it I'm just applying the precautionary principle of the idea of governing\nMaine we buy insurance to make sure our of our home burned down we've got to be able to rebuild it we by car insurance to\nFix the rack and hope in our life insurance and then somebody lost the life the family's okay why are we buy insurance against the death and destruction that will come with increased storms and increase climate change\nIt's beyond my understanding why are we going to have a president who is a desire of this science\nNinety eight percent of all the scientists in the world who ever watch this and looked at it with peer reviewed studies peer reviewed studies all say this is happening happening now and it's caused by not exclusively but largely by human beings\nAnd we don't respond to this whoa whoa to us any of them were entering another set of suicide packed\nIt could be worse than the United states civil war that right now we are heading I you know the goal in Paris was to keep the rise of the earth's temperature to two degrees

on October tenth it shredded buildings with the sheer force of it category for when and swept away entire neighborhoods with an eight to twelve foot storm surge\nMichael is the third strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the continental United States it passed through quickly though and drop less\nIs the third strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the continental United States it passed through quickly though and drop less rain than other recent major hurricane such as Laurence Harvey Irma and Maria [noise]\nOnly the Labor Day hurricane of Nineteen thirty five and hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine had lower barometric pressure is a key measure of hurricane strength\nAnd even some storm experts were surprised by how hurricane Michael intensified from a category one to a category four in just twenty four hours\nHere to talk about this unprecedented storm and it's possible Climate Connections we welcome another Michael back to the show Michael Mann is a climate expert at Penn State University Welcome back to living on earth Michael thinks the if it's good to be with you\nSo why did hurricane Michael intensify so quickly\nSo it it encountered warm a sea surface temperatures I'm In the low eighties in the region where it intensified and it became a major hurricane those temperatures are between two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures\nWhy is that why was the water so warm there there's just a fluke or are we looking at a trend\nSo there's been a degree Celsius of warming globally the oceans of warmed up and it's an ocean heat wave and the notion heat wave just like a normal heat wave is made much more likely with even a modest warming of the planet\nA hurricane Michael brought some pretty intense storm surges eight twelve feet and some of the coastal areas there how much the sea level rise factor into the storm surge these death\nWell you know sea level rise depending on where you are in the Gulf Coast or the U.S east coast or has been somewhere between half a foot in the foot and that's the warming of the planet the melting of the ice that's us sea level rise adds to the storm surge of every single storm that makes landfall in the case of Sandy a Superstorm Sandy in twenty twelve at at a foot\nTwo that are Thirteen foot storm surge\nMight sound like a modest amount a one foot well it meant twenty five more square miles of a coastal flooding it meant several billion dollars worth of additional damage um same thing with Florence making landfall in North Carolina again about a foot of sea level rise added to that storm surge\nHow much more frequent will be storms be particularly the hurricane Michael type this sort of intense quite pop up\nOne of the things that we're seeing with warm in warmer ocean temperatures you're more likely to see what we call rapid intensification and we we've seen this now so many times where a storm balloons\nFrom a minor tropical storm to a major hurricane over the course of a day or two and that only happens over very warm sees and are we getting more of these very intense storms this category you know three four five storms and that's where the science is actually the strongest\nIn fact there's a relationship for a category five storm you\nGet an increase of roughly seven percent in the maximum wind speeds for each degree Fahrenheit warming of the ocean now that seven percent increase in wind speed might sound modest but the destructive potential of a storm\nGoes as the third power of the wind speed so it was seven percent increase in wind speed is it Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential of the storm\nThat's for one degree Fahrenheit well with Michael those temperatures were two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures if you do the math\nThat means it was probably twice as destructive as it would have been in the absence of human caused warming\nYou know the latest in a governmental panel on climate change report is saying that the the world face\nNo the latest in a governmental panel on climate change report is saying that the the world faces perhaps more severe climate impacts of\nGlobal every surface temperatures rise more than one and a half degrees Celsius pulled the pre industrial temperatures what do we know now about how hurricanes could behave with the world it's more than one and a half degrees warmer than before the industrial age\nYeah so for each you know half a degree Celsius the better part of one degree Fahrenheit right there that's a Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential the storms\nThat means noticeably more damage it also means for each half a degree Celsius\nYou have a about four percent more moisture in the atmosphere so you're going to increase the potential for those flooding rains and of course it's impacting uh lots of other weather extremes and global sea level rise and all of these other attributes of climate that we are sensitive to\nIn the past uh the PC has been the conservative that when the data comes into the projections have been uh been lower than the actual uh numbers how do you think this report will fare or when the actual data comes in\nYeah so I I criticize this latest report for once again being overly conservative and its portrayal of the science and and I'll tell you it has to do with a very specific criticism in this case it's the way that they measured the warming that has happened and the PCC has chosen\nTo measure the overall warming that's taken place\nUsing a baseline that starts in the late Eighteen hundreds and and the reason for that is well that's how far back to their mom and her measurements go here's the problem human caused warming began back in the Seventeen hundreds when you know industrialization began so every tenth of a degree Celsius\nOf warming that's happened make that that much more difficult to stabilize below one point five maybe it's impossible now one point five\nTwo point oh or there's still a clear path toward stabilizing warming below two degrees Celsius\nWe hope you'll be with us for hearing now tomorrow morning from
