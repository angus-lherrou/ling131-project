acts of violence as the real threat here and yet in just one week uh we've seen three of attacks that were homegrown these were domestic\nAh acts of terrorism and violence so what our who is really the biggest threat to our domestic security right now Bruce\nWell two things first leads the twenty first century has turned out to be enormously in short time on any number of levels both in terms of political violence and terrorism but also in terms of an order that is rapidly\nShifting and you know we have a spectrum of threats and it's it's I think it's difficult to distinguish what's the worst and what's\nThe most threat they're all threatening and they're all bad because they all kill individuals and they all target individual\nRoutes I never I I have to say that I've never um walked into a school or up my place of work and thought and then was really afraid for my safety in my life\nI think most Americans these days would say they didn't ever think about um being afraid for their

during the period of industrialization\nAnd modern communications we saw two presidents assassinated within Twenty years of one another\nCertainly in the Nineteen sixties and seventies I think that you know terrorism hate crimes\nRest and sit along the fault lines of our society what we're seeing right now you're quite right is far more acute now that it's being in our modern memory\nBut don't forget one Eighteen month period between Nineteen Seventy one and Nineteen Seventy two there were twenty five hundred terrorist bombings in the United states\nSo this isn't a ... in terms of the violence on President but in terms of the moon that both you and brief described\nI mean absolutely there's been a change I think that the security we felt recent years has almost completely eroded\nFree let's talk about that a little bit because I'm you've done or perhaps one of the most visible acts of resistance when you took down the Confederate flag down a little bit about how the activist community is reacting to these uh recent events\n[noise] well I think that most of us view this as a resurgence of violence that has been a constant in this in this nation and I think that it's dangerous and in many ways a historical to try to lump lights the premises violence and with all other forms of terrorism\nFor one white supremacist terrorism is the most common form of terrorism in the United states it always has been you have to remember at one point Birmingham, Alabama was referred to as bombing him because the number of bombs that were being set off\nAt the homes of black residents who were trying to vote part of the problem of lumping\nWhite supremacist terrorism and with Islamic terrorism and some of these other forms of terrorism that her name is that white supremacist terrorism is unique in America and that it has a mainstream stake in the politics\nA lot of the views that are being espoused by these white supremacist terrorists are not far removed from the views that are being espoused by the G O P and particularly by Trump\nYou don't see as much pushback\nIn terms of labeling Islamic terrorism as as loud as Islamic terrorism because it doesn't have the same implications for American society America is not a majority Muslim nation however the ideology of white supremacy is very much in the mainstream of America now of course we have ... we have

with tens of a a guy from WNYC NPR I public radio international collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston\nWhen American voters head to the polls next week there'll be deciding more than just which party comes out ahead in this election cycle the winner of the mid term to have the power to shape our democracy through congressional redistricting that means the redrawing of the electoral map that happens every ten years\nAnd it's part of the reason why we're seeing so much outside spending on political campaigns not just federally but also at the state level\nHere to explain more it's Denise Ross barber she's the managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise welcome to the takeaway\nThank you for having me so can you tell us briefly and hopefully clearly how does redistricting work so after the twenty twenty census is conducted\nStates have to revisit their state legislator\nSo after the twenty twenty census is conducted states have to revisit their state legislative and congressional district boundaries and redraw them where needed what are they looking for in terms of redistricting\nDo where the populations are and if new lines need to be drawn or new congressional districts need to be established based on\nThe population numbers so for example in Montana we currently have one congressional district and that may have to get rearranged into two and then uh consequently another state would have to lose their district\nI mean there's only certain number of house members in Congress so you can't just keep adding to the number of congressional members so they just get re arrange but mostly\nJust the lines get drawn with regards to who's in what district that's primarily what happens and if you're a state legislator for example you may remain that state legislator but your district boundaries change\nAnd what kind of a role is redistricting playing in our upcoming midterm election in the vast majority of states the governor and the legislature hold the redistricting pens after the census that means that currently twenty nine governors and more than eight hundred state legislators who are in this year's\nBallot could have a hand in drawing the new maps\nSo it's a fairly important process that takes place every ten years or you know a lot of players involved and who is going to be controlling Congress to governors and senators who will be elected in twenty eight team because they won't be up and twenty twenty so they will be holding redistricting pens\nSo looking at the money that's being spent on political campaigns what are you seeing we just talked about how much money is flowing into political ads I'm coming from superPACs coming from the campaigns themselves individual donors what are you seeing as far as money concern\nIn addition to the fact that the U.S house is at play in terms of flipping from Republican to Democrat\nThis is a very serious and major election at the state level because most states hold their big races during the non presidential years so we have thirty six gubernatorial races on the ballot twenty of which are at play and according to ... there are twelve state Senate chambers that could flip\nBased on the upcoming election so\nThere is a group called the national democratic redistricting committee which is currently run by Eric Holder who also was one of the recipients of a recent bomb threat\nUm and his group to endear see has given directly to state candidates and political parties almost six hundred thousand dollars for example they gave two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the Pennsylvania democratic governor a candidate Thomas Wolfe\nThey've given another two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Georgia Democratic Party\nThey've given thirty six thousand to Wisconsin state parties and they also gave fifty thousand dollars and supportive uh Ohio redistricting\nMeasure and this is just money that is going directly to these candidates and the campaigns we don't yet have data on how much money these entities and others are spending independently on state races\nI mean you said it's hard to tell how much money they're spending independently are we able to find out who's funding efforts in state and local races certainly\nThe look we're able to know who is giving directly to the candidates and depending on the state laws we know the groups who are spending we may not always know however you know who's funding those groups\nState laws we know the groups who are spending we may not always know however you know who's funding those groups and that's the dark money problem that both races at the state and federal level are confronted with\nWe've seen this in the past and twenty ten how did Republicans what was the Republican strategy back in twenty ten and how effective it was that for them in terms of redistricting\nWell I mean they obviously took clear control of the vast majority of chambers of the state legislatures throughout the country they targeted specific races in order to do so they identified which chambers were most vulnerable and which seats within those chambers were most\nVulnerable and really spent money and they were very successful the Republicans had a majority in almost all of the chamber's across the country are in at least the vast majority of the state legislative chambers many congressional seats also swung Republican\nAnd I'm Wondering how much do you think constituents really know about what their state legislatures do the power that they have do you think voters really understand the issues of redistricting\nNot at all no okay so if they don't why not I mean this seems to be so critical it's a critical use of our sense is that the critical thing for those of us who want to get out and vote and who were voting for why do you think this issue is overlooked or misunderstood or not understood it all\nRight I I think because most people are just trying to get through their day in their year and they're worried more about their health insurance and whether or not they have a job and you know who draws a redistricting boundaries this kind of politically wonky [laughter]\nThe whole process involves just a lot of gene mapping and and it's really\nA game that's played primarily by the insider though the political parties the people who are going to the polls and and the voters who are\nPaying attention are paying attention to redistricting but certainly the major political parties and and their allies and these groups like the anti RC are very aware of it Denise Ross barber is

explanation of ... death a new report from the New York times reveals how the Saudi Government uses troll farms to orchestrate digital attacks against dissidents and journalists including ...\nBen Hubbard is the Beirut bureau chief for the New York times and he's been reporting on these social media campaigns\nTo farms are basically you know the best way to picture them would be like a call center like you would have you know to to field public relations were crusts or a customer or something like that except this is this'll be a group of people who've been hired to be very very active on social media to promote some kind of agenda in the case of the story that we wrote this was obviously to\nSort of do a number of things to try to benefit the relations during the the reputation of Saudi Arabia so this is to attack content that was appeared to be negative to Saudi Arabia and promote content that as positive for Saudi Arabia\nAnd tell us who was behind the troll farm and whether that farm can be traced all the way back to the highest levels of the Saudi Government\nWell it would be pretty impossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge of the Saudi Government so I mean this is ...\nTo the highest levels of the Saudi Government well it would be\nPretty impossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge of the Saudi Government so I mean this is a monarchy it's an authoritarian state so it'd be very unlikely that a grip on say impossible for this to happen unless it was signed off on you know by the government said we know that so one of the officials who was in charge of\nIn charge of this effort is somebody who's very close to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman a man who was you know that sort of the de facto ruler of the kingdom\nAnd what are some of the messages that these drones were using\nTheir their various ways that they do this sometimes it's just to try to manipulate hashtags that are already out there so if there's a ... that they perceived to be negative to the kingdom they can sometimes just flooded with various kinds of spam so that it becomes an away unreasonable\nThey also tried to game the algorithms to Twitter has to try to get certain hashtags onto the trending topics so if there's a hash tag that picks up or there's some cases it may have actually been created created by them\nThey can drive a tremendous amount of traffic to that\nAnd don't try to get it on the trending topics list which makes it much more likely than anybody inside of Saudi Arabia who's on Twitter is going to see that particular topic\nYou know to take a step back you kind of have to understand how important something like Twitter is in a country like Saudi Arabia\nAgain this is an authoritarian place that doesn't have really free media I mean almost all of the newspapers are government owned there's not a lot of public engagement or civil society they're not really places where you can go and discuss and so\nWhen Twitter started spreading in Saudi Arabia probably seven or eight years ago it was you know it was a huge deal for the kingdom and and a lot of people then we're very optimistic and said oh this has got to be this great new technology that's going to lead to you know it's going to democratize the discourse\nWhat we've seen is that you know this government really have the ability to manipulate all of that because they have huge huge resources from the oil wealth they were able to buy really the best off the shelf technology that you can find\nAnd they just they know they're they're very organized so they can you know either create automated box or in the cases that we wrote about higher human boss who you know our trolls are called her sock puppets there's various terms that people intact used for this but basically hiring people whose job it is to weigh in on the social media debates of trying to shape the way that they go\nThey drowned out a lot of messages they they've apple fight other messages they manage to get certain things that would not have been trending on the trading list on Twitter so they they've they've ended up being very effective and um they they they end up playing a real social media plays a very large role in these countries in just shaping people's perceptions of reality just as media doesn't any country\nBut the the differences Saudi Arabia is that they're just fewer avenues out there and so when they can so effectively manipulate what people are seeing when they get on Twitter that can really have an effect on how people really perceive the world around them a perceived their own their own government\nBut you also reported on an ex Twitter employee who was spying on behalf of the Saudi Government what do we know about that person well\nWe know that there was the Saudi engineer or Saudi Saudi tech person who got hired by Twitter was working there and then Twitter was basically tipped off by American law enforcement and said we have suspicions about this person that he hasn't been whether he was working directly for Saudi intelligence or whether he'd been sort of recruited to do this bit of work for them\nIs not entirely clear but the concerns were great enough that he was using his access to the company and his his access inside of Twitter to basically look up information about certain dissidents and provide that information to the Saudi Government\nAnd wondering if attention to this more now because a democracy she'll east death um he was in fact one of the folks who was targeted by these campaigns let's not\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... mile by the time he was killed had last time I checked at the gift\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... by the time he was killed had this last time I checked I think it was somewhere around a million and a half or more than a million and a half followers on Twitter\nHe was very prolific on Twitter he would tweet in Arabic he would treat in English he would interact with people he would have post articles and\nYou also so for someone like him this is a very powerful publishing platform I mean there are lots of articles published by the New York times that don't get a million and a half views\nBut you know somebody like to have that many followers just saw this on Twitter ... so\nThey put a lot of effort into trying to fight back against him and so he would get lots and lots of comments lots and lots of abuse and and and things like that so yeah he was definitely sort of one of the people on their list that they were\nYou know try to influence the way that the content he was putting out was being received by people\nOr we should also be clear that Twitter as a company has been under\nFire for a while now for what it allows and doesn't allow on its platform and how it controls where people can say and what they can't say\nAnd I'm Wondering from your reporting have they ah said anything about all this have folks from Twitter responded to either the ah the employee who was supposedly working on behalf of the Saudis or to how their platform is being used in this instance\nI'm not aware of any direct response for Twitter to the article that we published on Sunday I mean I Know that they they certainly have talked about other ways that they tried to do this there was you know they put out of information\nA few days ago I'm Talking about a large sort of a network I think they called it that they had taken down that was sort of a pro pro Saudi ... network that Twitter had taken down\nSo you know there there there are certainly aware of the problem and you know when when when um Twitter executive speak about this they say you know well we we want to do everything that we can to allow the medium to function we don't want to be censoring people we don't want to be taking\nThings down and less otherwise necessary so I I mean I think for Twitter they they're trying to find the balance between keeping the medium as open as possible but then also stepping in when they need to to try to shut down things that are nefarious\nThan

Fifteen people\nStudents over the past two days in a gun it's done a including a suicide bombing in the ... of of the capital Kabul and which Fifteen people were killed in that incident we understand a suicide bomber was trying to get inside the polling station when police stopped them from doing that\nAt that moment he blew himself up killing people who are around him but having said that fool the tragic loss of life that that was by I'm gone standards this was an uptick cheat Kelly\nBad set of days many people that fit that there would be in a lot more major attacks I mean I've been reporting from us comments on for a year and a half and and some of the attacks that we've seen in the last few months for example I I I've seen\nFifty people being killed in one single attack them and we didn't see anything like that from a security perspective that to me that when people who were killed that wherever attack people why in some cases prevented from voting we already knew going into these elections that\nEpisode will floating stations across the country we're gonna have to remain closed\nBecause of security concerns\nBought these elections was more peaceful than many fit they would the\nAre they considered democratic by the electric because of the attacks and the threats and many of the problems we just outlined\nWell enough to understand a lot of people are quite disillusioned with politics after years of violence and corruption I see that being in ... in Afghanistan over the last\nA week or so that was a lot of people who will also quite optimistic at times because they felt that indeed the elections are unlike in previous elections and number of the candidate for young with from professional backgrounds but wet educated\nAnd and people felt that they were in a position to offer of guns are some real political change and move away from a kind of system of politics that dominated by\nEthnic ... and buy all would warlords\nHaving said that that has been a lot of criticism within Afghanistan of delays that it cut during the election protests are a number of polling stations didn't open on on on Saturday or open late or early voting has to be extended into Sunday or what I was that some of the polling stations people would come and tell me that\nDespite having registered they couldn't find any names on the boat to the rules are problems with a a new biometric both to verification system that was introduced a little bit of a last minute ready\nIt's designed to prevent people both the more than one but because it was introduced so late a load of this stuff it seems one particularly well trained in how to use it and that helped contribute to the today so there has been a lot of\nCriticism of of the organization of the elections\nYou mentioned a lot of the younger more educated candidates that are running I'm Wondering are there any themes are there any common political threats that they share you know something that might be resonating with this electorate\n[noise] the one thing to note is that in and I've gone to San Juan parliament isn't to teach the powerful in comparison to the to the position of the president um\nThe second is that the political parties on really a dominant into parliament most candidates stand as independence even if they are affiliated political parties because political parties in in the country often associated with\nScience journalism and struggle for power so a lot of the people who stand as I say our our independence\nAnd that means that they can uh cultivate their own constituencies of support ready to that and he saw a lot of people who a form of journalists a civil society out to be standing and these are some of the people who\nBoth his what what quite enthusiastic about alongside them though the rules are a lot of big businessmen um\nStanding and these are some of the people who\nBoth his what what quite enthusiastic about alongside them do the rules are a lot of big businessmen\nUm the the children of former so called warlords who was standing for the first time as well so what a mixed bag of candidates who is standing on a huge number I mean over two thousand five hundred candidates standing across the country in ... when I was\nThere were eight hundred candidates for thirty three seats so the ... paper was about Fifteen pages long kind of looked like a newspaper reader\nAnd there were about four hundred women who ran among those candidates what can you tell us about them\nExactly so uh that's more like ... different number from the the number of women who riding in the last parliamentary elections in two thousand and ten to ... around four hundred women who took part in those\nBut as I say the number of of women among these candidates who people are are more enthusiastic about um I was speaking to to to one a female candidate she's twenty six year old very well known\nA TV reporter in Afghanistan and she was saying to me that she was standing because uh she viewed the older politicians is basically being corrupt and acting like a mafia\nOr ... in ... and she wanted a Afghanistan to move away from them as what is the fact that there were four hundred women are four hundred old women standing or I think around sixty percent of the candidates while under the age of forty\nAnd what about the current President Asif ... Ashraf Ghani he's been a president for over four years now does he still has support\n[noise] he said he doesn't and in fact one of the reasons why these elections I seen it so crucial it because next April will have presidential elections and they'll be\nMuch more politically significant because as I say the ... system that is quite centralized to the president really the key to the country and so these parliamentary elections which were meant to have taken place around three years ago and they've been delayed ever since then\nI only just happened now so the that was seen as a kind of dry run if you if you like for those presidential elections\nPeople wanted to see a wood enough off gone feel safe coming out to vote a will result be accepted that's another crucial question because a previous elections I've been marred by allegations of fraud and many fed same could happen again so these\nAre all key concerns that that people have a about the next presidential elections and we're hoping to get some kind of indication from these elections about how\nTo conduct or money inside Pakistan and Afghanistan correspondent for the BBC ... thanks for joining us thank you for having\nMore for the takeaway come from ...

during Tuesday's close game the Astros are currently down three to one against the Boston Red Sox and the American league championship series\nBut as soon as it plays on the team has also been questioned for reasons unrelated to his pitching since he joined the Astros last August in June major league baseball suspended as soon as Seventy five games for violating the league's domestic violence policy\nAnd while he was still suspended the Astros picked him up in a trade from the Toronto blue jays than the Astros made another move this week they announced a partnership to address domestic violence in the Houston area\nWith the Macintosh is a reporter covering baseball for SB Nation thanks for being with us Whitney absolutely thanks so much for having me so there's not a lot of information public right now about the OSU nah a domestic violence charge what do we know about it\nSo what we do know is that he was arrested back in may early may uh in Canada for an assault on an unnamed female victim uh in that case then a a police report was filed but because it was in\nFor an assault on an unnamed female victim uh in that case then a a police report was filed with because it was in Canada\nOr things are just a little different things are a little bit more under lock and key whereas in the U.S we would probably know some details what we know trial dates were pushed back throughout the summer while he was suspended a and eventually just about a over a month ago the criminal case was wrapped up\nWith a piece bond which is about approximately the equivalent of a a probationary a restraining order situation in the U.S he has a year of\nProbation he's not allowed to speak to the victim and essentially that was because the victim who lives in Mexico did not want to travel back to Canada to testify so they had no a reasonable expectation of connection um so that's where we stand the suspension has ended and uh yeah the the details are just a little\nFuzzier because we don't have that police report to refer to or an actual criminal trial that you know went under way so let's talk a little bit about ... a current domestic violence policy like what is that it's only been around for a couple of years um but it's led to some long term suspensions like in the case of tuna\nYes so I'm all these current domestic violence sexual assault and child abuse policy was implemented in twenty Fifteen\nI'm there have been a handful of investigations and suspensions to this point and no sooner was a the third highest suspension so it was a pretty significant a suspension it was the third or fourth one this year actually I'm most recently Addison Russell of the cubs were suspended forty games\nFor a domestic abuse so are there have been players offended before and after you know he is not the first but again his situation is very specific because\nThere was a trade that was involved um but MLD doesn't necessarily um similar other sports and that they do not necessarily wait until a criminal case has been completed they do their own investigation they speak to victims on their own time they may not speak to a victim uh at all when they take their a final decision into account\nUm an overall the process of the little bit\nA kind of like hosting this case it's a little bit um non transparent we don't have a ton of information about\nWhy oh so you know with Seventy five games as Russell was forty or a handful of players have been in the Fifteen to thirty range in the past few years we don't really know what ... investigation\nConsists of ... um so it's a little tough and it does make it uh it does open them up to speculation quite a bit especially in the Senate case you're saying\nHe's the third highest number of games he must have done something awful but we don't know um and we have no way of telling so it's a little tricky um and players under the suspended under the policy are as we've seen eligible to play in the postseason compared to players suspended for\nSteroids or performance enhancing drugs which are\nNot eligible to play in the postseason so that's a little bit of a\nTricky line as well so there's definitely some criticisms there are some issues of transparency as far as how their investigations go about but uh it's been a few years and you know uh I think of a case by case basis it's worked on varying levels for them as they like it to the Astros decided\nTo trade to ghetto sooner while he was still suspended and I get the ... and when he was speaking to the New York times earlier this week the general manager said this quote did we take a risk no question\nAre there are people that are still upset about it no question will do whatever we can at this point supporting the relevant causes and he went on to say that a tuna actually make the team stronger\nWhat do you make of that yeah I think it's a\nThe way you know the Astros have been a little a little bit calloused in this case um you know this is not the first time that a team has treated for a an a legit or confirmed domestic abuse or in order to win the world series the cubs did this with our oldest Chapman a star closer currently on the ...\nTreated for a an a legit or confirmed domestic abuse or in order to win the world series the cubs did this with our oldest Chapman star closer currently on the Yankees a few years ago and it did win the world series and it worked and fans kind of had to\nCome to terms with whether that was worth it with those tuna um the ... been a little bit more blatant about that what we're doing um you know he ... he throws it touches he's gotta when he could win at the world series\nWhen he what's interesting about this story is that the arrows now have a domestic violence campaign tell us about that what is that\nPurely for the optics of ... having gotten no sooner is that a real serious a campaign that they really have put a lot of energy behind what is this campaign\nI think it can be both but it does come across as significant PR spin Jim ... owner of the Astros did openly admit kind of\nWe now that we've created for good and we want to make sure that domestic violence awareness is a who in an important thing for the Astros foundation which has a thirty million dollar and Dalmatian um so again he kind of said the quiet part out loud we trade in for a domestic abuse are\nNow we'd like to do the work in the community that hope hopefully makes us feel better about that I feel like they're trying to have it both ways it it does um the players have been saying oh he's a great clubhouse presence you know ... flew an H J Hinch Jim and manager of the team have kind of like\n... he's a he's a great player he can put that pass behind him it's great and now they're donating I'm

that we're serious obviously\nBut they weren't only ... the fall and then people ... raised and hatred became a support for this terrible character this terrible guy\nThat people tend not to see all they see and maybe they don't want to have the exact conscience of while they are actually supporting\n[noise] he's mostly not exploiting on any of the conditions that exist or social divisions that exist in Brazil right now\nWell definitely mainly the middle class in satisfaction because well er during the the workers but the government's during the Thirteen years they were in power there was significant growth for the poorest\nBut middle class the state more or less the same\nShow they were after awhile closer to the poorest than to the reaches [noise] and this created some sort of set this faction through a great part of of a population [noise]\nAnd now I think both so NATO is exploiting exactly that and has the support of this people even though it's his policies won't do anything good for them they tend to do a lot well\nFor the reaches not for the middle class\nI Want to read an excerpt from an essay you broach and ask you to to tell us a little bit about it in in your essay you said quote\nIt Brazil were not drowning under so much rage so much hatred so much yelling if there were just a single moment of silence perhaps everybody would be able to hear the alarm bell sounding something in danger\nIn many ways clearly understands a lot like the moment in the United states that were living right now are you concerned about what you see is what's happening in Brazil and also what's happening across the world\nDefinitely it's a great a reason for concern\nAnd well perhaps we are now in the frontline or something a lot bigger\nI'd like to consider it a backlash of many other advances we've had in this last decade in Brazil that seems to be the case that please because there was this a progressive governments for Thirteen Years and then you have this reaction that very conservative and\nBesides the reactionary\nIn Brazil we don't have a strong democracy as you have been in the United states it's been only Thirty years of democracy at this point since\nStrong democracy as you have been in the United states it's been only Thirty years of democracy at this point\nSince the less dictatorship and you never know when the military will get in the way again we'll start gaining power and becoming something else so it's a great reason for concern definitely\nAnd in terms of those in Brazil and Brazilian society who would be most vulnerable under a ball for NATO presidency\nWell first of all that's not really the poorest because she has a very violent program for fighting crime organized crime and without considering the risks of that\nThan arming great ... of the population than giving license for police men to kill without any serious investigation\nSo we know that in in the ... we'll see a lot more blood then we see now which is very serious\nAnd of course there will be also persecution of the aisle you beat the community because he's been talking about that's his entire career\nWomen will suffer because well he he tends to be against policies of the quality the indigenous community as well he doesn't want to preserve the land\nAnd the original black communities as well so it's mainly the most vulnerable will suffer more\nAnd we don't know if that will be something similar to what we had during the dictatorship that was the suggestion of this than the activists\nHe has said things that's going to that idea but we are not sure how his planning to do that or if he's planning to do that at this point is just a vague men and well many people don't want to see what it's called\n... says the Brazilian writer and

can't really\nYou can't make that up it would be super corny you know I mean someone said recently who saw the film\nThat it it has a very eighties vibe what does that mean well I was a kid in the

in a parking lot there was a photo Matt\nYou know to the pacing you know there's an eighties pacing maybe like if you watch sixty minutes from Nineteen Seventy five it's like it's really hard you know it's it's really slow the pacing everything so quick now\nBut I think the pacing of the film is\nIs in the spirit of the story he wanted to tell he was a documentary filmmaker so there are long scenes music is a very important part of the film and it was funny the editor was telling a story of how\nMy father would make everyone listen to the soundtrack and he made me listen to it too that's the one thing that I always remembered but in some instances the music plays out in a way that it's almost like a music video which to me like almost like a long long for music video which in a in an interesting way with kind of ahead of its time or\nSort of merging with the emergence of music videos and I learned from someone that he was inspired by super fly for instance that that had like a amazing soundtrack and he wanted the soundtrack to almost be a character in the film and that's definitely the way it is\nDo you think that when you look at black film today in twenty eight teams do you think\nThat there is enough nuance I'm black everyday life in those films similar to the way that your dad was able to bring that life is I think that is one of the most compelling things that you're talking about is just how nuanced and how delicate these portrayals word do you see the filmmakers are getting better at that\nWell I think Hollywood is recognizing that there's money in this audience and people of color have more than one way to beat and there's nothing wrong with not having a broad world view but Hollywood television in particular likes to put people in boxes and why marketing money okay that's\nBut Hollywood television in particular likes to put people in boxes why marketing money okay that's very specific group of black people like these hair care products that you can sell stuff to people\nI get it but I think this sort of box that that same literate you no pun intended black box that we've often been put in it's too small\nIt doesn't fit anymore and um you look at you know my man child is can be no you know you look at this sort of new wave of\nOkay here's some other black people to who have stories to tell who are great and so I had hoped that things are changing but you know changed never comes as quickly as you'd like\nYou're also filmmaker are there any projects um that you're working on coming up\nWorking on a four part film about the Wu Tang clan there twenty fifth anniversary this year and um [noise] to really understand Wu Tang clan I mean you can listen to their music and enjoyed it sounds great but like\nTo really peel back the lyrics is to have a real understanding of who they are and where they come from and as I tell people all the time to understand hip hop or blues or jazz\nYou know all these art forms or reflection of in a reaction to the environment and so to tell the story you've got to understand the environment all the things that they went through to become who they are and so to me the music is the cherry on top\nIt's all the other stuff the environment the social climate all the things that they had to overcome that really make their story compelling\nIs there anything that you're taking away from your dad filmmaking process and incorporating it into the work that you do\nWell saying something every time I have the opportunity to make a film\nI say something you know I did a film called fresh stressed about the history of hip hop fashion and you you learn about a Sunday Best and most people you say Sunday Best and they think it means where a nice suit but they don't realize it means in certain states that was mandated that they had to buy their slaves and nice outfit so they can go to church worship a guy that white or supposedly white\nThere aren't a lot of people looked like me

a new series from the center for Public Integrity that looks to shine a light on some of the poorest communities in the United states just months after the president's council of economic advisors\nDeclared that the war on poverty with largely over that narrative neglect the stories of countless Americans still struggling under crushing economic conditions and today we turn to a community in North Carolina where natural disasters and poor governmental respond to have exposed the depth of that suffering\nIt's Columbus our journey so much Chris our living out here and march first and then through storms just a\nHurricane Florence made landfall in the Carolinas last month and the devastation brought back painful memories from just two years earlier when Hurricane Matthew tore through the area the first category five Atlantic hurricane in nearly ten years\nFor residents of lumber to North Carolina in rural ... county the devastation was inescapable\nArch it affected everyone in the long range and affected base everybody but they don't understand it made forty nights and forty days and days and you know it was\nIt was just deja vu for these residents the damage was just horrible\nThat's actually ... a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity and I talked to her about reporting in Lumberton and whether or not residents stories were reflected\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] ... everybody they don't understand it I thought it was\nIt was just deja vu for these residents the damage was just horrible\nThat's actually ... a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity and I talked to her about reporting in Lumberton and whether or not residents stories were reflected in the rosy economic picture touted by the Trump Administration\nLumberton North Carolina it's a it's one of the most diverse rural counties in the country actually um you have about a third white a third black a third lumpy Native American and a growing Hispanic population so it it's a very interesting kind of make up there\nAnd of course we're looking at this series through the sort of idea that the president of the United states has recently and said that we solved the war on poverty that were good when it comes to poverty but Lumberton is actually one of the poorest an unhealthy is the most dangerous counties in North Carolina tell us about what that looks like\nYeah so I visited twice or the summer and this fall first to kind of see what the town look like after being hit by Hurricane Matthew twenty sixteen and you could still see a lot of the destruction from that long ago you would see\nPiles of sand that had come from under the river that people hadn't cleared out I'm Still some furniture laying out some houses that just were very dilapidated in some areas where they had already torn down the entire house and there was just a green space\nAnd what about the impact of Hurricane Florence\nYeah so they got pummeled again I'm almost two years to the day which\nWas just horrible because when I was there in July you would still see all of this destruction but I was talking to a lot of people who are finally getting their lives back together um one woman I saw her the day that she got into her new home that was just rebuilt\nAnd then Florence head and the same thing happens all over again her houses was flooded and I heard that story time and time again\nAnd are there any people or groups in particular that these residents would like to see more from I'm Wondering about FEMA um or any other organizations theme has been on the\nGround Red Cross has been on the ground there was an issue with Hurricane Matthew with HUD money with housing and urban development money that hadn't come through from the state\nI think about ten percent of the money that was gifted from the federal government with actually distributed so people are saying well okay the money hasn't come that time around then and that's two years later and so what's going to happen with Hurricane Florence money um how would how would that going to work\nSo Chris Howard the lumberjack resident we heard from earlier echoed those same concerns and trying to get help rebuilding his house\nAnd it just gets medication [noise] [noise]\nWe don't know what was going to me [noise] that\nI talked to many residents that one either or to discourage to even apply for aid because they were told that they would never get it denials are very frequent FEMA admits that and they say you just have to apply again but that's really discouraging to residents one person that I spend a lot of time with uh\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] we don't get me [noise] that\nI talked to many residents that one either or to discourage to even apply for aid because they were told that they would never get it denials are very frequent FEMA admits that and they say you just have to apply again but that's really discouraging to residents\nOne person that I spend a lot of time with a stand Powell she actually went back and forth with FEMA twelve different times talking to different\nRepresentatives having to tell her story again hearing conflicting things you need this piece of information you need this to the point where she just gave up on that process so the recovery for a lot of people that need it the most\nThat were really hit badly and are in shelters are staying with family members the system isn't really working from them and the way that it's meant to this\nIs a district that was reliably democratic but did end up voting for President Trump who has said as we mentioned earlier that the war on poverty has over is that a disconnect for the residents of Lumberton\nAlso at the time but it was very interesting as I said before just showing up matters\nAnd during the hurricane a lot of the people I talked to said we saw Donald Trump's boss we saw the big name Trump on the side of the bus we Lara Trump passing out water bottles to us and that was really memorable and we didn't see Hillary Clinton and\nDonald Trump also was kind of talking to the points that really resonated with Robin Sony and such as I'm going to get rid of NAFTA uh a lot of people say took a ton of the manufacturing jobs out of the county um I'm not sure\nHow much they think that he's held up their promises but at the time he seemed to be speaking right to them\nAnd where does lumber to go from here obviously there are a mid term elections coming up in a couple of weeks though there's probably still a lot more recovery to be done where do they go from here\n[noise] yeah so that's something I was trying to piece together when I was there because I still have hundreds of people in shelters and maybe voting is the last thing on their mind or they weren't really politically engaged to begin with that is one of the reasons we chose Robison county they have a very low turnout rate\nYou're trying to rebuild you may not be living in your house you maybe with a family member so board of elections are saying well we can send you an absentee ballot you can\nVote from anywhere we're sending them to shelters we extended the voter registration date by three days\nBut people are that I talked to are saying well I don't know if these measures are enough so it'll be interesting to see who does come out for this election if they're if they're angry enough with\nBeing hit twice in two years and don't feel like they've been paid attention to is that if that will matter or if again they're just going to be struggling to stay afloat\nAshley ... the federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity Ashley thanks for being with us so much for having me and you can find a link to the abandoned\nA bizarre number one and\nNumber two I I just think it means that shift away from what I think is more kind of sensible middle of the road foreign policy where we've had consensus about working with our allies and talking about our values and ambassador Haley or I think reflected that consensus in\nAt a time when the president doesn't and I worry we're going to be or even further away from what I think are important thing\nSee not American electoral politics but I just find the timing to be extremely\nA bizarre number one\nAnd number two I I just think it means that shift away from what I think is more kind of sensible middle of the road [noise] foreign policy where we've had consensus about working with our allies and talking about our values and ambassador Haley ah I think reflected that consensus in\nAt a time when the president doesn't that I worry we're going to be or even further away from what I think are important things to stand up for\nAmbassador Michael McFaul served as US ambassador to Russia from January twenty twelve to February twenty fourteen ambassador thank you for being with us sure thanks for having me\nOf learning on this is the take away

degrees\nOh\nThis is the takeaway from WNYC NPR I public radio international in collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston\nToday is the voter registration deadline for one third of the states across the country from Arizona to Georgia to Illinois and beyond that if you want to vote this November this is your reminder to please go register\nAnd leading up to election day we've heard a lot about election meddling whether by Russia China some guy in a basement or otherwise but what's not been in the media spotlight is ensuring fair access to the polls for everyone in the United states who wants to cast a ballot\nHurdles for voters are now getting thrown up across the country just this year the American civil liberties union filed a federal lawsuit against Arizona saying the state put more than five hundred thousand voters\nAt risk of being disenfranchised and in June a federal judge struck down a Kansas law that required proof of citizenship to register to vote it was deemed a violation of the national voter registration act\nJessica who's minutes here to tell us more she's a reporter with ProPublica and the lead reporter for election land a coalition of news rooms covering problems with voting and twenty Eighteen Jessica thanks for joining us thanks so much for having me I appreciate it help us understand what's happening here we know that since twenty sixteen there'd been a couple of changes as we mentioned at the top\nWho are affecting really voter disenfranchisement who can and can't vote in this country what some of those changes been so there\nAre a lot of states that have um issued new voter ID laws or there are states that have redrawn they're voting boundaries and to make it more difficult for your voice to be heard um in terms of gerrymandering and making\nDistricts far more ... than than they once were and this is sort of been a slow progression states have also a become a little bit more um bold in terms of um cleaning the voter rolls and sometimes that\nIs sometimes that crosses the line into purging um and and so there are there have been a lot of action especially in the last two years to make these things happen so there's going to be in this election it's going to be the first time that a lot of these laws are in place in our expecting at least a little bit of confusion at the polls\nLet's talk about that because um we talked a little bit about you know cleaning and purging what's the difference there between cleaning the voter rolls and purging the voter rolls I think there are lots of civil rights activists who say this is really an effort to purge and keep communities of color and other folks off of the voter rolls what are you saying you know I think that it\nSometimes that crosses the line into purging um and and so there are there have been a lot of actions especially in the last two years to make these things happen so there's going to be in this election it's going to be the first time that a lot of these laws are in place in our expecting at least a little bit of confusion at the polls\nLet's talk about that because um we talked a little bit about you know cleaning and purging what's the difference there between cleaning the voter rolls and purging the voter rolls I think there are lots of civil rights activists who say this is really an effort to purge and keep communities of color and other folks off of the voter rolls what are you seeing you\nKnow I think that it really depends on who you ask I think I'm there I think there's no election administrator\nRed and yellow purple green that would tell you that ... that voter roll maintenance is bad I think we all have an interest in making sure that people who are no longer living in our communities or who are no longer eligible to vote for whatever reason remain on the voter roll\n'em but there are states that do this and in a in a particularly aggressive way that might make it more likely that a person who [noise]\nUm say doesn't check their email very frequently or wouldn't know to respond to a specific male or or doesn't vote regularly would be more likely to be purged from the voter roll 'em so for example the Houston case which the Supreme Court decided just recently\nAllowed the state of Ohio to remove people from the role if they didn't respond to a few mailers and also didn't vote in and I think two elections and so if you think about the people who are least likely to respond to a postcard that looks very much like junk mail if we're being honest and then also not regularly turn out to vote\n'em those might be people who are minorities or the poor or the elderly who are least likely to vote any way and so they might be at higher risk for getting purged from the role that it really depends on who you ask how severe\nThey believe that problem is if you talk to someone like the Brennan Center they're going to tell you that it's a crisis have you talked to someone like the public interest legal foundation they're going to tell you it's good\nPractice practice but I Want to push back a little bit there because when I get a notice for jury duty and clear what that noticed is I don't think anybody Mrs notices like that why aren't these notices\nClear or are they seem somewhat deceptive if you're taking people off the rolls and not making it clear that you've done that I mean doesn't isn't that somewhat anti democratic and\nThat that's not necessarily the case in a lot of states there the mailers I agree could be a lot clearer um but they do send the mailers more than one time over a period of a couple of years I'm\nAn ... that said though people are very likely to ignore them even if they get them a couple of times like I'm not sure that I Would take a look at a postcard and realize that the cat that consequences for not responding to it is that I might be removed from the voter roll\nOr helps if the language with huge big bold letters as it is when you get a jury summons and it clearly says if you don't show up you're gay rested I Want to turn around for a second here because\nWhat happens at the twenty sixteen election there were and I covered this there were lots of threats at the polls a more that the fear of people being threatened when they showed up at the polls\nUm peoples claiming to sort of want to implement these checks and balances when they got there are you seeing that for the midterms as there are there is that that many levels of concern in terms of who can and can't vote you mentioned confusion at the polls wasn't that going to look like\nThink that what we're more likely to see and this was the case as well in two thousand sixteen\nAnd we anticipate it ahead of the two thousand sixteen election um a lot of voter intimidation that was on the news every day there were people actually actively making threats about intimidating voters at the poll and costing them there\nThat didn't actually happen um in two thousand sixteen we only saw that a couple of very isolated locations and not for very long and it didn't appear to be any sort of an organized effort and so even if we start\nOf concern in terms of who can and can't vote you mentioned confusion at the polls was not going to look\nLike so I think that's what we're more likely to see and this was the case as well in two thousand sixteen I'm we anticipate it ahead of the two thousand sixteen election um a lot of voter intimidation and that was on the news every day there were people actually actively making threats about intimidating voters at the polling are costing them there\nThat didn't actually happen um in two thousand sixteen we only saw that a couple of very isolated locations and not for very long and it didn't appear to be any sort of an organized effort and so\nEven if we start hearing sort of threats ahead of the mid term elections I think that people should be really wary of the idea that someone can scream at them in front of their polling location is actually not a threat that we have seen and but the talk of that threat\nIn and exaggerating its likelihood would prevent some people from turning out to the polls so I really want to stress\nThat we did not see that in twenty sixteen and we don't necessarily expect to see that on twenty Eighteen well we did see them twenty sixteen and what we do anticipate singing twenty six twenty Eighteen is confusion around new laws so for example and twenty sixteen the Texas voter id law was implemented\nUm and it wasn't even necessarily that the law itself disenfranchised people but because there were so confusion about what the law actually say\nThat back when you said they didn't actually disenfranchised people the voter id doesn't the voter id require you to have an idea and a lot of people don't have\nThe right it does but in taxes and twenty sixteen there was a reasonable impediment declaration you fill out and that was not appropriately implemented across the state and so that and the the ... information in terms of what voters expected and what poll workers are trained to do this and franchise quite a lot of people and so we expect to see the same sort of confusion I'm twenty eight feet around new laws\nJessica who's been as a reporter with ProPublica and the lead reporter for election land Jessica thank you so much for joining us thanks so much and
