you write a song about [noise]\nThe Irish remember the events and the pizza shape their history and the many traditional songs written over the lyrical look at some of the heroes of Ireland some real in some legendary we're joined now by singer happy right cat he's proud Irish American she lives in the northeast corner of the public ...\nShe's with us right now and travel with Rick Steves to introduce it to some of the people that Ireland remembers and saw Kathy so good to have you here\nIt was great to be here whenever I think of you I I just think of just a joy of life in the context of Ireland helped music ties in with that and I also remember you grew up in Detroit yeah Motown music I mean how did a Detroit girl\nGets so just swept away by traditional Irish folk music to the degree that you moved there and now you're a well known Irish folk singer\nFrom my father was a singer he came from Tipperary and he was a brilliant tenor fabulous and my mother was a musician a harsh so she always had music on the\nStereo playing popping down member vinyl one after the other plummeting down and also we were members of the gay the league and the Irish American club in downtown Detroit and that was our community that was where we socialize so I sang my first son into a lake there when I was seven\nFor my father for Father's Day and I would get up after that sessions singing sessions where everybody sits around and they play instruments and they sing songs\nAnd people don't know that about Detroit it's a it's kind of very very strong Irish coffee lately had a bit of Ireland in Detroit absolutely and then all the time I spent in Ireland as a child and my grandmother's kitchen and my grandfather's kitchens\nNo television the news came on the radio otherwise it was off\nEverything was generated by us and it was all song and story it was a magical time I'm so grateful that I got to have that experience as a kid\nOther countries have music but no other country has music quite like Ireland\nI agree a lot of people say it's because Irish music things to the heart I Believe it seems to something larger the spirit\nIt bullied the spirits of the Irish who have left through the centuries of no choice of their own to make a living and other countries to go fight in foreign wars\nIt also kept alive as you said in your introduction all of the her role with people and pride of place every single little nooks and crannies in Ireland has a song written about it it is a way to name things and to keep them sacred if you will\nSo when you drive Rhode Island as a tour guide you must be bursting with an interest in order to a new town that has a song about added to I don't want people to run off the boss throw me off\nThe bus but yes you can sing a song about everything for me it punctuate and historical talk something I'm Talking about I can say\nAnd now I like to sing this song for you but there are songs about you know winning rates dogs there are songs about greed horse that there are songs about people's families there are songs about deaths in communities drownings off the coast of ... that are heartbreaking\nSo everything is kept in the music it's a life raft\nHeartbreaking is a lot of Ireland's history began of your relationship with England and uh just tough times and civil war once Ireland wins it's I mean just in a nutshell\nYou were subjugated by the the English for centuries yeah you finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there's the civil war about how Ireland is going to be managed by its own people\nYou finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there's the civil war about how Ireland is going to be managed by its own people\nExactly who side are you on do you want a completely free Ireland or we take this interim step of twenty six counties until you can get\nMore so than Nineteen sixteen rising yes big deal it was like the American revolution and yes history just a little over a hundred years ago there must be songs that bring you back to that that ... you're Irish patriotism we're pride\nAnd even better than that right because some of the men and women who are actually on the front lines during the Easter Rising wrote the song and I'd like to sing one fee now if that's okay sure this is a song that was written by ... peers Patrick Henry peers was one of the signatures of the proclamation of independence\nAnd it's a very powerful song you took an old melody and you wrote new words to it\nAnd he is saying to the people grace O'Malley who was the pirate clean environment born and fifteenth thirty she was the chief didn't offer clan and she fought hard against the dominion by Elizabeth the first she's saying she is coming over the waves and she is going to liberate you from the foreigners\nKnock people from France or Spain we are now going to have our own heroes so\nShade a law that they all girl who they need to you\nKnow it's you know\nOh shit oh girl Shannon how are ya oh shit\n\nThat's just one verse so the Irish are going to save themselves yes and they're going to do to become Gaelic\nYes it's going to be the Gales not the French or Spanish and it's going to be ... and I love the corps because what he's over ...\nYou are welcome home you are welcome home now that the summer is coming the rising for them in spring with the planting of that seat he says in the last of the sun we may not live a week after this right and they barely did we may not live a week after that but in summer will be the bloom of what we've done\nSo now at this point there's already been the the ... the Ira spreading out time yet as tend Irish people in America for every Irish person in Ireland yes stand which is actually a a global call for the Irish people to recognize that absolutely is the new morning\nYes because money was being raised in America\nBy Ayman devil there to bring back to support their efforts in Ireland and also a lot of musicians there Michael Coleman brilliant settled player changed the way Irish people play the fiddle his label was called republic records and they were raising money from the music to send back to Ireland\n[noise] this is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Kathy right she's been in the vanguard of Irish music now for more than twenty five years before um rent ensembles like church ladies and she's also a solo performer\nKathy was named the Irish female vocalist a decade too tight by live Ireland dot com\n'cause he was born in Detroit now she calls Ireland county loves her home [noise]\nInformation about Cathy's albums and her performance catch on her website and that's Cathy Ryan dot\nAnd when we think about Ireland it's also a proud culture of course it's got its struggle with London to be independent and I understand that the first printed book of Irish ballads also served as kind of a cultural document for Ireland to\nIt's a valid history of Ireland I'm not sure if it was the very first book but it was the most lauded book and the most except that it was Thomas Davis who was one of the young Ireland there's the movement um that was very very ...\nMost lauded book and the most except that it was Thomas Davis who was one of the young Ireland there's the movement um that was very very strong the precursor actually that they would have inspired peers and condemnation and Plunkett when Ireland was starving during the great hunger\nThomas Davis was writing songs about nationhood he was a pacifist he didn't believe in aggression he was a Protestant as well\nSome people listening might think oh between Catholics and Protestants knows the fight for iron sovereignty was Protestants and Catholics fighting together because they wanted Ireland to be its own nation but he wrote songs and he believed\nThat the best way to serve the history of the country was through its ballot tree\nAnd I think that's true because all of the songs of Ireland struggles are ... they still exist were still singing them they keep it in the present and also they make it very ... everybody becomes a part of this struggle or the this hope because they're singing it\nAnd you get caught up in that even the tourist whose first day in Ireland if they can find themselves into a a pub or you have a session going on that's that's really filled with locals you get caught up in your welcome to be caught up in this way the music invigorated the national spirit\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reasons why is because we all know in Ireland uh singers and musicians that it's not about off it's not the culture of celebrity that's sadly we're going into now it's about the song or the chicken\nAnd we are serving it now if it was a great song or two and it was there before us and it will be there after us so we're just playing our part in continuing the culture\nYou know when I was in Dublin recently of course you're going to hear her street musicians and your music and the\nPubs you actually hear street poets people that are standing on the street corner and they'll they'll do perjury for your eye on request but yet if in would end the thought that you've got poets who would put their poetry to music something audience don't realize there's an extra dimension was a great Irish poet that might have been caught up in the music\nGates gates gates and I when I'm On the coach at the tour guide I play gates reciting his poetry because he sings us\nClear skies and human this evening Loeb around sixty Seventy degrees sunny skies tomorrow with

to an exotic locale\nDisappears under those circumstances and is rumored to have been eaten by chemical was it true or did he\nHas the official reports claim [noise]\nJournalist crow Hoffman was determined to find out what actually happened to Michael the Rockefeller\nThe Twenty one year old son at New York governor Nelson Rockefeller was never seen again after he went missing in New guinea back in Nineteen sixty one\nRetraced Rockefeller during combed through our times and interviewed I witnesses to come to his own conclusions which he writes about [noise] Savage Harvest a tale of cannibals colonialism and Michael rocker colors tragic quest Carl good to have you back on the show\nThanks so much so that I said that Rockefeller story up correctly there\nYes no question I mean now Michael graduated he was the son of Nelson who was the governor of New York at the time and he graduated from Harvard and went off to New Guinea to work on a film and his father had opened the museum of primitive art as it was called then\nA few years earlier and Michael was a trustee and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were incredible ... and he determined to go to as Matt and try to collect some as Matt art\nWhich he did he made a quick ... sort of a reconnaissance journey of a few weeks and then went back to the film and then when that was done he decided to go back\nFor a couple of months and are on that trip he vanished\nMichael Rockefeller was Twenty one years old this was back in Nineteen sixty one and you're studying up this did it seemed like he was just a a buccaneer looking for this indigenous art to bring home to the his primitive art museum or did he really become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it in\nIt's hard to bring home to the his primitive art museum or did he really become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it and and connect with\nWell I think it's a little bit of both I mean I don't think Michael was much of a buccaneer he was young Ernest man very smart well educated he'd grown up around\nOur you know the way I'm most American Kids have grown up around baseball and um you know some of the greatest started of of the world\nHe was enamored of ... and fascinated by ads met culture and as Matt carving it means you know the best of the carving the most spectacular of these things were\nYou know twenty three twenty four foot high a polls kind of like totem poles if you will\nI think he had a an earnest interest in it and I mean you know at the same time he was young he was inexperienced he was wealthy he ain't no got access and breaks the regular person wouldn't have had and certainly those things contributed to the disaster that he fell into\nAnd this is in New guinea this is a huge island down them between Thailand in Indonesia as one of the most remote places on earth really how do you go there and find the artistic treasure and then by it to bring it home what's the mechanics of that\nWell at the time it was known as Netherlands New Guinea was Dutch New Guinea the last Dutch colony of the east indies and that of course made it a little bit easier for him but the region that he went to was as mad it's ten thousand even today it's ten thousand square miles of road ... swamp\nIn the inner villages there are no stores no plumbing no electricity\nOr he bought a boat from a Dutch Colonial patrol officer a sort of a two dugout canoes with a little bit of a sort of Huck Finn like a cabin on top then with a Dutch miner or thirty four year old anthropologist named Renee walk thing and to local boys they just went off from village to village\nYou know and they would arrive in the village and say they're interested in stuff and people would bring it out but you have to understand in Nineteen sixty one asthma was an incredibly remote place really western contacted just been made in the late Nineteen fifties and as Matt were uh\nUh people of great artistic passion and power but they were also a constant warfare with each other and ah\nWe lived in a world of the sacred reciprocal violence of which the art was all a part in a you know and and head hunting was an integral part of their culture and part of that had hunting you know was also some cannibalism and\nMichael unwittingly stepped into a very complex political world\nAnd he ended up at the wrong place at the wrong\nTime and you know you could be very wealthy and sophisticated but from a cultural point of view could also be very naive and green venturing into a society what\nOne of the great ironies of the story is that you know this is a a man from who represents you know the most powerful family and the most powerful country in the world in and asked mad at the crucial moment he was\nA the least powerful man and all the world and you know cannibalism is all about intimacy and power and it's all about taking somebody's power\nHead hunting and you know when the as men men\nWho killed and did so they were taking back their power sort of a desperate bid to take power back that had been usurped by Dutch colonialists and Dutch efforts to pacify them and take away their culture and [noise] and they consume them and there's no more\nArticulate display of of power than that so did they eat Rockefeller\nConsumed them and there's no more [noise]\nArticulate display of of power than that so did they eat Rockefeller thinking they were just eating a white guy that represented colonialism or did they know they were eating a man from the most powerful family in the most powerful white country\nNo they didn't know anything about the Rockefeller's the Rockefeller name meant nothing to them I mean it's a complex story that in a nutshell in Nineteen fifty seven as I said the Dutch we're trying to pacify the as mad in Nineteen fifty seven\nThere was a war between two villages and many are men were killed in a local men you know they killed each other and a very aggressive or racist Dutch Colonial patrol officer went to the village specifically to teach the village a lesson as he wrote in his reports and he\nWas afraid and he brought a lot of armed policemen with them and he arrived into the village of ... which was a\nLegendary you know traditional place to place that had resisted the incursions of the Dutch and didn't want to change its ways why should it why would want to\nHe ended up opening fire and killing five people and that left the village with a sacred obligation to you know everything was a ... I mean spiritually and it left the village with a sacred obligation to reciprocate the man's death than Michael kind of swim into that as it turned\nOut so he gave them the opportunity to reciprocate basically by stumbling into their world Pete did\nCarl Hofmann spin on assignment to more than Seventy countries has a report\nToday in travel with Rick Steves he's telling us what he discovered about the plight of Michael the Rockefeller has he investigated his disappearance ended deadly clash\nBetween cultures and the jungles of New Guinea his book is called Savage Harvest [noise] no I I don't want I guess I'm focusing on kind of a fascinating and apparently it's it's a reality but I guess when these tribal people decide to eat a human being is not a matter of nutrition it's not like the Donner Party\nIt's a matter of um power and symbolism is that right\nYeah it's not like you know we're hungry let's go get a Big Mac or anything on it was easier to get an animal in that regard but you're just searching yourself by symbolic well immediate ritual is Terry somebody yeah it gets very complex but\nNo cannibalism is with in a is a sacred to act with in a complex Web of obligation and ceremony and customary laws and that has great meaning and important\nIs there a ritual a stick way to actually cook the person yes very much so which I won't go into a here but I Do in the\nBook the Rockefeller family are maintained that their son was was not a victim of chemicals\nWell he was actually on a boat crossing the mouth of a river that engine trouble and then flipped over and drifted and Michael said you know I think he violated the first law ... which is to you know never leave the boat as long as it's still flowed and he said I think I can make it and\nRenee waltzing was older and wiser said you know if you go you're on your own I'm not leaving and Michael did and he swam away from the boat and he was never seen again\nAnd there was a massive search and of course Renee was rescued the following day by Dutch patrol planes there was a massive search for Michael you know Nelson and Michael sister Mary both went to New Guinea immediately and", "year": "2018", "show_name":

on travel with Rick Steves we're learning how things work in Japan with Dr ruth economic she straddled the differences between American and Japanese culture all her life and is the author of the moon guy\nCalled living abroad Japan Ruthie also hosts tours of Hokkaido website is living abroad in Japan dot com you grow up as a child of a missionary parents in I don't I was always curious about this it it seemed like when you have a spiritual vacuum people\nEmbrace [noise] hop religion that come and go do you have any ever think about that well you're in Japan\nWell I think the Japanese attitude towards religion is very different than in our country that is they're not exclusive to one religion or another they take the best of any religion and adopted as part of their life it's almost just part of the culture so\nFor example babies that are born they take them to a shrine to be dedicated and most weddings are either ... or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife\nWhereas she still has to do with\nSacredness and the president life ... and so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival I might be Buddhist it might be shouldn't do it might be Christian\nIn your book you wrote that and I was just adding up the numbers are you said eighty percent of the people identify as Shinto sixty seven percent identify as Buddhist and I thought he didn't resent plus sixty seven that's more than a hundred but it right away because people can can gather their religions I guess\nYes and so one of the difficulties I guess you'd say for missionaries such as my parents were it's very difficult to have somebody except Christianity and then exclude the other religions\nOr so and as a missionary you'd have to do that is ... nor the gods before me or or this sort of the right exclusive\nAnd that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who\nWho were kinda like sure that sounds good I'll I'll embrace that but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else\nSo they were ... they would pick on Christianity but but it wouldn't be the only religion Ruthie what is Shinto and and I mean I'm sure that's a complicated question but I have a good sense of what is Buddhism and what is Hindu as I Am and what is Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally she told means the way of the gods it's a type of ... or the belief in the sacredness of\nNature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock in the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate\nOfferings to the God that help God of agriculture for example so there are no images\nInto his room and what is Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally she do means the way of the gods it's a type of ... or the belief in the sacredness of\nNature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock in the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate\nOfferings to the God that help God of agriculture for example so there are no images inching do like statues are idle or anything\nAnd it's believed by tradition that even the emperor of God has mystical origins and descended from the sun goddess who created the Japanese island\nThe emperor God do you mean the the upper who's considered a God\nUsed to be yes but not anymore right now he is a symbol of the state of the people but again Japanese don't exclusively claim one religion over another so these are just stories and missed that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to a scene till shrine\nIt's kind of like it gives your society some basic parameters some cultural ideals that sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it's the idea of sacredness making things\nClean and purifying getting rid of evil spirits and so there are many holidays that celebrate something\nA sheep though and there's regional festivals harvest festivals or ... rice planting festivals that are related to do so it's kind of blended into the daily life\nI was struck by a I was just confused at holiday time because I was in Japan over Christmas one year and and Christmas was like just a big party everybody was the subway was filled with people with cakes and everybody getting drunk\nAnd then on New Year's and you know like a whole each time and I'll never forget stepping out my my door and and they were banging this song what a hundred and eight times\nOn New Year's eve you go to the temple to a wash away the hundred eight types of sense that\nYou may have committed at temple down very slowly hundred and eight times [noise] and then as soon as midnight passed on New Year's morning people flock to the ... they'll shrine\nTo pray for health and success and\nHappy new year and by ambulance or even something to put it in your car for\nTraffic safety and so on at the sheep they'll try so they do both Buddhist to get rid of the old year she'd do for the new year [noise]\nThis is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Ruth you connect you hear a book is the moon guide book called the living abroad Japan and really the one we're thinking about living in Japan [noise] what's the respect for women in public in the workplace and so on a hand in the domestic world these days or just in general\nYeah so I think things are changing quite a bit the marriage rate has gone down and so has the birth rate because a lot of women\nPreferred to develop their career or start their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there many opportunities\nIn terms of employment and a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working\nStart their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there are many opportunities\nIn terms of employment in a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to but the other track is for women who value their own free time and don't expect to have a life long career than there are more like secretaries or support staff\nAnd sometimes they quit when they get married there used to be pressure to quit when you get married but it's not true anymore so there isn't any changing yes\nSo the younger generation has has pretty much said we're going to demand a little more respect\nI don't know if I put it in terms of demand respect but they're going ahead and doing what they want to do that on their own and not not necessarily thinking that you have to go to university and then get a job in a big company why not start your own company or right start some kind of news service or go overseas\nOur phone number is eight seven seven three three three seven four to five and Scott is calling us from mountain Georgia he's got thanks for your call Ira how are you I'm great have you had

travel I tend to write isn't in places that you'll see on British TV phone number is eight seven seven three three three seven four to five Elizabeth from media Pennsylvania thanks for your call\nYeah sorry to hear you\nKnow somebody I Will be but right now I've got other fish to fry how's it what is your favorite the memory of being a a a fan of British or television or movies and then traveling\nShark is that I ... I'm ... and I don't really care [laughter] the pressure on Iran now how do you got it worked out it seems like a small island youthful you know what are they in fact for of course that's in that are\nSo Shetland there's a a murder mystery about called Shetland is that right yeah that's\nRight and the island doesn't seem to have enough people to murder\nThey used to have a lot but they're all dead now [laughter] so this\nThis is true of all of those you can get to these places quite easily shutting induced by flights and ferries going from the mainland and everything else but that's always the cost of all of these a country like Britain has such a low manager right if you watch\n... I guess the Christie all of these you'd wonder that we don't have the highest murder rates in the world\nSo you just watch it on TV and you don't need to do it in ... maybe we should have a license\nSafety valve but Shetland these well we're going because you might want to go there because of the TV series but there's so much to see their anyway and when he would come behind it\nAnd you make a good point they seem like a long ways away but there's little puddle jumper airplanes that gets you there and a half I I just went to the arc nice in Scotland and it was so easy I Do I just decided to get myself forty eight hours out of my dinner affluent son had a great time Elizabeth did you have any other comments or or suggestions\nI didn't want to know where it would be a good place to visit our\nWilling truth [laughter] you'd have to stay on Shetland because I'm although the connections are relatively frequent see the sights of the island you'd really need to base yourself on

and leave it to beaver and sort of a we have enough stole Jake simplistic look at the Nineteen fifties but sort of peeling back the layers to tell us about Australia in the Nineteen fifties\nWell it would post war for us that's how we define it so there was a depression um people who are returning or not so there was a lot of loss a lot of shrapnel emotional shrapnel in people's psyche is\nA lot of them in a disappeared into the women had sort of taken I've found a better place for themselves in society and community in the workplace\nAnd it was a time of reconnecting to cultural identity I suppose there wasn't a lot of frivolous he and a celebration necessarily even though it was a seeming success um because the last threat stride in suicide rates\nSo the show starts with a woman returning from either say Mike ... Adams\nHaving being away from home for a long time and she had fought in the ... and ... a Holocaust survivor and that's all explained in the show as to how that could possibly happen to her and she makes this very well to do family on the ship on the way back\nIn accidently fooled madly in love with the um the son who\nWho are of course it's not the right match and should never bay and saw a war begins outside the war didn't between this family and this woman\nIt's really a look at where we've Bain and how far we've come about what I Love about this show and back in late that creates what he's done he's set it as a melodrama and he talks about um the ... films so he's referencing in particular genre and so it's quite heightened\nBut it's it's about a deep underlying um prejudice\nAnd racism and xenophobia and um they took the to the subjects that we haven't really explored on a straight in television necessarily before\nIt is interesting that we can look at these hard issues and we've got the same challenges in the United states and\nIt sort of disarmed us to go back to the fifties and and look at it and how how it was dealt with in that time\nAnd then to sort of be haunted by the fact that we're still struggling with it today talk for a minute mark too about the whole idea of the adjustment for a society where women all of a sudden are going to be more respected and at the same time expect more in the in fact I had that sense when I saw you even when you were sailing\nFrom ah Britain back to Australia after the war in in a place to go home the sense was you were going to march right in there and this is a new age and women are going to be respected\nWell that's what I had always been very family based women in the kitchen men out to work it really had begun that way for a very very long time and as I say much the men left so the women had to fill those roles they were pushed out of the kitchen and into the workforce\nThe thing about steroids she come way they'll say Europe and surviving a Robin broke with where she was incarcerated for either three is she's in us by trade and had continued to her ... in London\nAnd he's a woman who who really doesn't need to be the center of attention and yet ... actions keep putting her in the spotlight because\nShe's selfless but she she marches for the greater good and so I really enjoyed playing at the end\nOut of the kitchen and into the workforce\nThe thing about steroids she come we don't say Europe and surviving a Robin wrote with last year was incarcerated for either three is she's in us by trade and had continued to her ... in London\nAnd he's a woman who who really doesn't mean to be the center of attention and yet her actions keep putting her in the spotlight because\nShe's selfless but she she marches for the greater good and so I really enjoyed playing that to an ruffling all the fed is of course which are in the ... amazing costumes in the Nineteen fifties\nAnd there's a lot of fun to be had out of it too it sounds very depressing but actually there's a lot of joy in watching that happen as someone breaks down the world so I just stay home rain\nAt a time when you come pick up a ... or send a text you have to arrive and actually have a conversation which usually means a cup of tea and some end Zach biscuits switch off one of our nation's greatest biscuits some\nMade

the kind of lost vestige of that\nAnd certainly it talked to a lot of the ... um and internationally as well it'd be like Downton Abbey because it is it's a fool absorption in another place and it's like a different world\nUm it's like traveling when I travel to Japan and I go this is like being on another planet I Love it so much because it's so different and so completely off the and that's what they should really is\nAnd it's just beautifully written and delicious filmed and wonderful acting up do you think that a lot of us it's a hit in Australia in part because Australians are just missed all about the fifties or does it a challenge them to see where they are today and and and where they need to go\nI think by those things and I think actually what's so unique about this show is that three generations sit down to watch it together and that old fashioned thing of sitting around the fire than sitting around the radio than sitting around the television\nHas been returned to families a lot of people talk about that how they all sit down together because everyone can watch it and everyone can relate to it there's there's three generations of women and men playing out their lives that there's something to recognize for everyone\nOn and you can also horse ride that which is another beautiful thing today\nI said was talking about walking over a bridge what was that bridge

Kenya and he now teaches Shakespeare at Cambridge he explores the universal appeal Shakespeare in his book Shakespeare in Swahili Edwards thanks for being here thanks for having me on right now this is so fascinating to think of Shakespeare breaking out of\nWestern culture especially in the East Africa can you first of all tell us about your passion for Shakespeare in your work at Cambridge I\nHave been upset to chase bits and say you know a fairly young age by my childhood in Kenya and wasn't one of these children who had a news in the book\nThe entire time I spent my childhood or off pretending to be here as rather than reading about them a but certainly um since my teen years I've seen a difficulty of Shakespeare and and I went on to\nRead that University in and then teach at Cambridge but it wasn't until I happened upon this project that I managed connect ... two very disparate parts of my life\nNo the subtitle of your book a Shakespeare in Swahili land is in search of a global poet it's kind of like elevating Shakespeare to be more than just a a a hero of western literature but global how could he be global without being merely cultural imperialism\nYeah well I think a part of the story is about cultural imperialism um it's about a British rate is taking Shakespeare to East Africa as a kind of ... to protect them against the dock consonant\nButs what few people realize is that very early on in his history Shakespeare became detached from Britain from being simply a British possession\nOn and it was translated into a wide number of uh of languages so for instance one of the great discoveries in this book was to find that Indians who had taken Shakespeare from British culture back in India but had been proved type it to build the railways in East Africa in the early twentieth century\nHad it's extraordinary culture all performance off shaped in Mumbai in nearly twenty century I at one point shake day was being performed a mall in Mumbai southern in London's West End\nAnd these were you know glory Italy irreverent productions much like Shakespeare's own day you know shake it was that was released his check for Bayh was a mad at the state has to do what's necessary to get bumped ... seats to entertain the audience and these were very much\nShakespeare plays but taken in re made 'em that speak to the people who performing them in Mumbai in nearly twenty century so I think you know as long as things that become\nPetrified as long as we you know we didn't put things off on a pedestal and insist that they don't change in order to understand them in New ways and set nice shakes they can and has come and live in in very very different places than the way he originally wrote the place\nNow that's an amazing image immigrant laborers from India working on real way in Kenya adapting Shakespeare plays to entertain themselves and and make life jolly is another example of our Shakespeare sort of a appeals to people that several levels were these players when they're used by for instance immigrant laborers from India in East Africa\nAre they adapted to fit the culture are they\nPlays when they're used by for instance immigrant laborers from India in East Africa are they adapted to fit the culture or the amped up to be more entertaining or on their level or are they just straight translations of Shakespeare like we would not\nUm no I mean they they are adopted again is a wonderful twelfth night where instead of being shipwreck off the coast of Kenya as happened in Shakespeare's play the opening scene sees a train wreck which sweeps they are the main characters down or with a into a movie called kingdom and I'll take that's going to speak to people\nWho are themselves working on a very dangerous set of uh of of railway construction projects\nYou know that hamlet settle on mood called battlement ... Juliet in a wonderful Romeo and Juliet adaptation and again spoiler alert here since anyone who's never see for me and Juliet or instead of stabbing herself at the end of the play she uses a poisonous snake\nIn order to kill the which kind of tone or into because that's how again sport or less sorry\nUh that's how Patrick dollars at the end of ... so it's kind of wonderfully fertile reimagining of the play and one that pact out houses I fear says\nWith five hundred people every night of the week and these were corrugated on shacks in a fledgling city of Mumbai on you know I think it really brings alive the cultural vibrancy of East Africa in cities even in this in this period\nOr guest on travel with Rick Steves Edward Wilson Lee He's a professor of literature in Cambridge and the author of Shakespeare in Swahili land\nIn search of a global poet Edward is it safe to say\nI mean you're focuses East Africa but would this be\nEast Africa as an example of how all over the world Shakespeare is adapted to local cultures and the writing might be tweaked so you're not going to be stabbed you're going to be killed by a poisonous snake if that's what happens in your culture and I got to be on a ship or it could be on a train wreck but is that happening all over the planet\n... they're extraordinary Shakespeare traditions in India in Russia and Japan\nAnd China I think this East African story is extraordinary because there are so many different periods in which Shakespeare is tweaked in different ways he's used as this kind of um this ambulance to protect the explorers he's used by that mission rate to create a written culture of Swahili language\nThat is now a spoken by a hundred million people\nHe's translated into Swahili he's you know he performed by the Indian parents and then you know in the late twentieth century he becomes a real flashpoint for talking about the extent to which these countries in the aftermath of colonialism want to be open to the culture of the people who had been colonial over ...\nI'd like to get a little more into that but first of all a Edward defined Swahili land East Africa\nYeah say Swahili land is not a terribly commonly used to and it's one which hopefully capture has a set of countries Kenya Tanzania Uganda\nParts of the Congo allowing him which Swahili is either the main or one of the major languages\nThis also in the region was government as a kind of single entity by the British colonies so the reason why they speak Swahili is because the British colonial offices and mission raised landed on the coast which is west what he has spoken Swahili is\nKind of very Arabic influenced to language and\nAs the colonial governments moved inland and ah they would damned if they were going to speak I learned more than one language so they made everyone else learns why he has they moved in and out of them is just\nHappens to be a convenient language for the colonial overlords to use so they don't have to learn all the different tribal languages and because of the British imperialism widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nSo it it is the legacy of colonialism but on the other hand it's also a legs\nAnd because of the British imperialism so widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nPrecisely so it it is a legacy of ... but on the other hand it's also like to see that it's created to shed culture between all the games are African culture within one of these countries in Africa\nOr now you talked about uh the missionaries using Shakespeare's what is nineteenth century missionaries and checks for having common when it comes to sway\nThe main character in this story is a ... cold ed wood ... who was the mission ... Central Africa descent now for Britain\nHe arrived in ... in Eighteen sixty seven and he is the machinery and it's his job to try and convince the locals to Christianity but he sees it as central to lead to create electricity so he actually spends a lot of time\nTrying to understand local culture is translating Swahili ... into English and trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things printed in Swahili\nHe is a translation of challenge to marry lambs tales from Shakespeare cold ...\nPrinted on that little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational tax schoolchildren in Kenya and Tanzania if a ... century after that\nSo missionaries want to look for people to be able to read the Bible and you know promote their faith and in order to do that people had to be literate and\nMissionaries had to understand their culture and their culture need a better understanding of the missionaries culture and Shakespeare helped pave the way\nYeah so the idea I mean if you're a you're a missionary uh you believe that won the gold has created to old people and that means that old people must have some kind of shed language of beauty that they can commuting in an overseas Shakespeare was held up as this this great genius\nWho in ... because he wasn't terribly well educated had access to a kind of universal notions of beauty that allowed him to speak this very pure language of beauty and so the assumption was that wherever you ... if you translate to Shakespeare into those languages they would also be able to appreciate have that's\nAs we can this American Life I'm pleased to present here on the Brooklyn Academy of music up or how they [noise]\nDon't but it's true stories like we always do this time for him to do a musical turned into opera [noise] also\nSplit among some years later like perfectly or even married for ... ... ... than [noise]\nGuys meant that exceeds [noise]\nAnd that was certainly me or I travel with Rick ... guys missing [noise]\nThank you [noise] ...\nMore than a decade exploring Iceland and focusing especially on cyber music scene [noise]\nHe's fall Kevin at a team from K. XP radio in Seattle heads of Reykjavik to broadcast live from the Iceland Airwaves music festival\nPool has traveled the each corner the island nation that has made many local friends he's tapping their studio now to share his passion for one of the hottest traveled destination to anywhere these days and it's music scene Kevin thanks for joining us and thanks so much for having me Rick appreciate that of all places to take a radio crude to broadcast live\nWhy would you choose Iceland and wipe you've gone back for so many years in a row well\nReason is they have an incredible music scene has some ... a little history on K XP were a Seattle based radio station with a global audience and we're committed to finding and discovery and great music no matter where it's being created\nWe had been going to music festivals in the United states like south by southwest in Austin, Texas and see I'm Jay in New York City but to the first trip to Iceland as a station I really wanted to make a point to to the K XP would travel to the\nFarthest corners of the earth to find a great music to share with our listeners worldwide really you know music is like travel in a way to write and our belief is that if we can harness the emotional power of music and bring people together\nIt helps create a more tolerant and understanding world as we get to have those experiences through music can get to understand each other's through various different types of music and uh you come to realize that the world is a lot smaller\nMusic and get to understand each other through various different types of music and you come to realize that the world is a lot smaller place a than sometimes we think it is even when it's far away\nAnd there are different dimensions of cultures that you can use as your entree into a more intimate connection with that culture can be cuisine that can be art it can be music ... and a music certainly it's almost a cliche but it's an international language you can sit in a pub in Ireland or or I suppose in a small concert hall in in Reykjavik and feel like you're celebrating the same thing\nWith local people absolutely and and I think that's part of what drives K XP and to your point you don't even necessarily need to understand the language to be able to feel the emotional quality or what's being conveyed in the music\nThere is that magic spark some times I've been in in traditional music or sessions and Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength and I just I Walk out of there just marveling at what a mad it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel transformational really yeah\nTransformational is is such a a great word to describe a\nWhen you have those kinds of experiences and for me personally that happens a lot with music when it when it all comes together and and I'll tell you one of the reasons we went to Iceland or I went to Iceland for the first time was\nI wanted to go somewhere to experience the summer solstice could have done that in a whole bunch of different places but there was a band called cigarettes and they uh had an album called\nI'll get to us here in the [noise]\nWas so magical when I first heard it and [noise]\nI don't even know what it was it it's just so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful\nThat as soon as I sat and listen to that album I was like I Want to go to the land this Mueller that came from where that came yeah I Want to try and understand there's something about that if I listened to some music for ...\nIf I Want to go to the fjord and look at the view where his cabin was when he was inspired to write that you have the music is sometimes so unfair you want to be translated that you want to go to the to the place from where it blossomed yes music and sometimes\nIt inside travel okay so you're organizing this now in the sense with a passion for Iceland in particular\nYeah so the first trip I went to was before we started broadcasting and again I don't know if you've had this experience but it was two thousand five and it was so remarkable and it's so far exceeded my expectations that I actually did not want to go back [laughter]\nYou didn't want to go back because you thought you'd be ruining it ruining ... yeah I you know it's so hard to replicate something of reality about it yeah if I go back with a TV crew and it didn't come out where the magic I was your last year was incredible do it again yeah and sometimes it doesn't so\nI did not want to go back but I was so into it and and kept talking about the music of ice on my radio show I ended up hooking up with their trade commissioner and general counsel if you're in North America leaner good Johnson\nAnd that to a series of events ended up culminating in us actually going to Iceland the broadcasting live and I had to do a scouting location trip before\nAnd I've been fourteen or Fifteen times now in every time has been a deep rich experience for different reasons and we would not keep going back in broadcasting live if there was an incredible music year over year over year which is remarkable for a country of three hundred and twenty five thousand people\nBut it is this music that comes out of Iceland or is this a celebration of many cultures that go to be together in Iceland\nWell it's a bit of both now where the music festival we broadcast from its called ice on the airways and it's a showcase for Icelandic and Nordic bands new and emerging bands from the Nordic countries along with a beautifully curated selection of international ban sevens and gathering of people from all over the world\nAnd new and emerging bands from the Nordic countries along with a beautifully curated selection of international band so it was a gathering of people from all over the world\nBut the focus is Icelandic and I think what's happening now though musically because of the Internet is were all able to hear music from all over the world so musicians and creative people who are curious become naturally ...\nThat's a a boon for music culture and internationally and it's probably a bit benefit of the Internet a lot of people don't don't appreciate and don't take advantage of like they might [noise]\nLand of Byron I punches way above its weight as a source for innovative contemporary music\nOur guest right now in travel with Rick Steves is Kevin ...\nShe's program director of Seattle's noncommercial K. E. X. P. radio\nHeads a music post on a weekday afternoon ...\nKevin sharing what he travels to the Iceland Airwaves festival every November in Reykjavik the hair wet it's many bands and musicians are up to each year\nYou'll find links to the festival hand to Kevin radio show at ... dot com slash radio\nKevin when we're talking about this listener's experienced this attendees experience this music appreciation experience [noise]\nI don't think of Iceland is a place with great intimate Venus I mean I've had magic experiences say\nIn pubs or in in wonderful beer gardens and so on but what is the venue like does that contribute to it in Iceland or is it just I'm a concert hall\nSo Iceland Airwaves is a a multiple shows and events happening each night over four nights\nIn various different venues in sometimes not even pennies because any space that could be a cool place to host a band becomes one but they've got things like uh the harp a concert hall which is an amazing facility\nThat is where are all I've been there that is a matter of pride for Reykjavik it really is the concert hall standing right every Kennedy being capital seems to really prioritize for a suitably creative and rooted in in local values kind of a wonderful concert hall yeah\nI think all the stone as Isabel ... definitely rooted in their in their country\nIceland brags it's one of the most illiterate nations uh I think they got more books published per capita than anywhere on earth and has a vibrant music scene is as you're tuned into with all sorts of of creative genres\nAnd lots of creative people have you thought about what makes Iceland a punch above its weight or ... that sort of phrase a because it's a tiny island and it's in darkness most of the year [laughter] what what is it about it that has so much creativity man that's\nIs a great question and music journalists have been trying to break the code on that one right like why does is a small country have such an incredible music scene and why is it so creative and\nAnd I think it's a whole bunch of different factors in fact I had the the president of ice on the on my show or all of her grandson and\nWe were talking about Iceland's assets you know you've got geothermal energy and the the knowledge around that you've got the fishing industry you've got data mining but he said that the most valuable asset of Iceland is the creativity of the people\nAnd he sort of tie dead into again the legacy where the lineage of the the saga is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "city": "Yuma", "day": "19",
