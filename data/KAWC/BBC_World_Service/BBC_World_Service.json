I'm trying to remember where I met a but it was just last week I was reading some articles and it was really talking back to New Jersey in what they had achieved and how it has become a beacon an icon for other countries are very time to read this today but thank you very much for joining us as I mentioned we're very glad you and your team I safe\nMatthew ... so I feed on journal is currently working with BBC Arabic documentary [noise]\nTwenty minutes ... are you with us from the b._b._c. um we want to turn to Pittsburgh down and no doubt\nTwenty minutes ... are you with us from the b._b._c. um we want to turn to Pittsburgh down and no doubt you have seen details of the synagogue attack\nAs survivors have been telling their stories of\nHow they headed storage rooms to avoid the attacker and ah when the suspect was detained after a shootout he reportedly told the officers he wanted old Jews to die\nAt the eleven victims there were named on Sunday into the husband and wife a woman age Ninety seven\nAnd the ATF ... they're Jewish non governmental organization that are based in the states they do this year early study into anti Semitic incidents in the country and into hasn't in Seventeen they recorded on this Tuesday has an anti Semitic incidents that was fifty seven percent more than the previous year\nAnd for the first time since two thousand and ten\nAnd incident occurred in every us states to say to the highest number of incidents where New York California and New Jersey Massachusetts Florida and Pennsylvanians Evan and now even both live in Pittsburgh are both Jewish you both very welcome to the program Hi Evan I never\nSaw this on Neil nice to have you both with us um well I haven't perhaps I could start with you I tell me tell me a little bit about yourself\nUm my name's I don't know I Lived my whole life here in Pittsburgh\nUm I don't want to go too much into detail Sharon fortunately identifying myself more specifically could carry consequences for me and my family at this point\nUm [noise] but uh you know Pittsburgh in general as having lived there for a long time um is a very peaceful community that has a great\nJewish community and it's always been\nYou know accepted and\nIt's always been part of it um I Can't speak highly enough about the city\nSo I haven't I mean let's chat about that for a moment though you don't feel comfortable giving more if your identity and we're totally going to respect that but I just want to hear a little bit more from you on why you feel that's necessary or why you feel perhaps it could be a trash\nI have a family uh that's also Jewish uh my daughter goes to school\nIn the affected area um and I would hate to call attention to that area and make it'd be a target for even\nSomebody whose idea of a joke at this point um I think caution was warranted\nUm and unfortunately I think the idea somewhere out there in somebody's head to the to do something else um well visibility is here because that seems to be the pattern lately with these incidents in the United states\nVery sad now that you're listening to Evan there can you identify with what he's saying [noise]\nNot quite not everything I thought ... years and I'm teaching at that turn on synagogue um I Believe we should stand out and be stronger we shouldn't be in hiding\nAnd I'm very proud to be who I Am I Am part of a Holocaust survivor my dad went to the Holocaust and [noise]\nI think we should stay strong and be together\nYes and I think there is you see there you know I was seeing the rabbi off the tree of life synagogue where this happened calling for a politician to stop using words of Hays I mean do you think the environment has changed over the past few years I understand you grew up in Israel now the book came to the states\nAs you fell in love with an American [noise]\n[laughter] I did move to ... thousand and four and\nNever had a problem in Pittsburgh not ...\nI did move to people Gary ... thousand and four and\nNever had a problem in Pittsburgh not one I Am part time lift driver\nWe have a kind of a ride hailing service shall we say yeah\nI'm I'm Jewish I'm\nI'm a teacher can scan on me turned sixty four centimeters and never won and fear all worried\nAbout anything in the city so has this incident changed anything for you\nKnow now it's that one bad apple fits bogus a beautiful place to be\nSo Avon and might be like to speak specifically to now though because she has one take but I think I'm feeling from you that you have real concerns\nAre real concerns but that's not what the city of Pittsburgh and clear on yes um so I agree with everything she said about the city the city is wonderful and all you have to do is look to the mayor of the city right now and what he's doing and even looking at the other community organizations within the city for example the Muslim community raised\nOver Seventy thousand dollars to support 'em the victims of what happened on Saturday So\nIt's not a knock on the city it's more or\nOf you know you don't want to call attention to yourself right now just because there are people out there in our community that look to do harm to you on social media or other places those aren't necessarily residents of Pittsburgh\nI also um agree with the comments that that was alone actor but unfortunately this is not the first time an incident like that has occurred in the greater Pittsburgh area\nThere was a similar incident and the year two thousand in April where a lone gunman similar situation um\nYou know murdered five people and they use those crimes were based in anti Semitic feeling [noise]\nAnd and I suppose that's what I'm getting at and I just have a another Minnesota I'm Evan Bush whether you think the atmosphere in the states has changed when it come out yet it has been being Jewish you feel it's different\nIt's not specifically because I'm Joyce ... just the attitude towards anybody that's different is no longer an attitude a except during Senate shifting away from that now and again\nI sorry go ahead no just ... go ahead\nAnd I agree we should definitely pride disrespect and acceptance when you forget to do it and we don't teach our kids and that's the outcome of that\nSo you feel there is an individual she gosh has permeated the society\nIt's really interesting bus I'm just as we go and then you feel the city has come together over this year getting so Saleh ...\nAbsolutely I have no doubt the city will respond to the right way\nTo thank all of the communities and pitch slogan the Iraq Iran war for the support love and care that we're receiving it's really touching and hot for me\nBut we loved having you on thank you both we wish you all the best stuff is Evan

World Service with me in golden [noise]\nTime professor of globalization and development at Oxford University\nPreviously I was director of policy of the world bank and before that was CEO of the development bank of southern Africa and was economic advisor to Nelson Mandela when he became president and the country of my book South Africa [noise]\nAnd the previous programs in the series of explode the dramatic consequences of the financial crisis which envelop the world [noise] ten years ago [noise]\nThe crash had a devastating impact on many countries putting millions of people out of work and eroding wages and incomes from which the number of countries are yet to recover [noise]\nThe failure of the world's well paid and powerful authorities an expert at the bank is quoted firms\nCentral banks treasuries and International Monetary fund and yes economists like me to stop the crisis will prevent the result in Europe crisis contributed to collapse in trust this turn politics on its head\nWe cannot say the decision and taken in Nineteen Seventy five by this country and joined the common market has been recessed by this referendum to lean the EU British people have spoken and the answer is where I\nThat's the biggest political shocker in American history the idea that Donald J from a man has never been a politician who never served as a general or the army is the next president of the United states\nEmmanuel Macron will be the next president of France they say the polling projection that we have sixty five point five percent for Emmanuel Macron says four point five percent or Marine Le pen\nI Believe that the election of President Trump and president Macron and the votes for Britain to leave Europe have in common a rejection of the old guard of political leaders that won't juicy when the financial crisis happened\nWithin the rich countries the crisis fuel to power shift towards populist an anti authoritarian politicians and contributed to the rising resentments of elites globally it accelerates at the LBJ shift to China and Asia\nIn this program I'm going to ask whether the lessons from the financial crisis have been loans and where the country's in a better prepared to meet the next one will be condemned to another crisis perhaps even more severe which would provide new fuel to the fines of populism\nIn two thousand age the world was taken by surprise will it be again\nI also Christina God the managing director of the international Monetary Fund which is the global institution responsible for financial stability what worries her most top of the list is the populous politics of protectionism and attempts to wind back the regulations on banks\n\nThe crisis arose because decision makers were blinded by blizzard of information finance is highly dates are intensive industry order to credit rating agencies banks and regulators reduced everything to numbers [noise]\nAs the volume of Trump's actions group and computing power increase [noise] more and more data was being crunched [noise] and economists were able to build the models using ever bigger day to say [noise] and yet relying on the state to prove to be increasing the inadequate decision makers were overwhelmed with information\nAnd unable to disturb what matches from the fire hose of data directed at them [noise]\nAnd political leaders are meant to be paid for the judgment thinking and intuition the evidence shows they relied on badly interpreted big data and groupthink and when the system collapsed they took refuge in blaming others\nBut nevertheless seems amazing to me that so many clever people go to so wrong\nCould it be that the system was captured by short term Muslim politics cronyism and corruption the rating agencies were paid by the banks they rated the older firms relied on the business of clients come\nAnd corruption the rating agencies were paid by the banks they rated the order firms relied on the business of their clients companies many economics faculties dependent on grants from banks the politicians were paid by Wall Street has this changed Jeff sects of Columbia University\nWe are in the United states they pay for play politics through very expensive election campaigns if you want to have your opinion heard you give large funds to the politicians\nAre election cycles are billions and billions of dollars spending on campaigns and now it's the billionaires who dominate this we ended up with a pseudo\nPopulism of the Trump variety which has brought more billionaires into government and more lobbyists into government than we've ever seen in our history it's the most corrupt government we probably ever had\nCompletely the opposite of what the public really wants and what it needs but undertaken in the name of a draining the swamp but actually filling it with the worst or reptiles we have\nA priority for the Trump Administration and bank lobbyists is to roll back the regulations put in place off to the crisis and especially what became known as the dog Frank act his Adam twos also of crashed how a decade of financial crises change the world\nVery few people inside if I get actually operate this I think but it leaves the golfing they'll founded the way to make the American financial system will save\nEveryone understands that Doug Frank is a ... says the office said is may ... difficult the business of running a bank and the United states regulate treat the new the norm is the level of\nLegal wool fat at the bank has to wage to comply with Doug Frank is remarkable that the kind of got saying that the Republicans promised is likely to make the at the mess resilience\nAnd his promise to drain the swamp and get rid of the revolving door between Wall Street here in Washington obviously reverse the points to Goldman Sachs banker\nIsn't that no no I mean the sense that Trump was getting to the mall any fundamental ... uh with the incredibly incest us relationship between American politics and I'm Out in business is clearly just an illusion\nThat is at record highs again and the numerous worrying signs not least the prospect of a trade war and rising nationalism husk allow me was the director general of the world Trade Organization during the crisis\nBe totally Ben's on the amount of education about if that was to be a real way wall or something you just on a wall bans on the wall songs on if\nProductions was to fare up school so then this would have an impact on roast and having an impact on growth would have an impact\nOn production full says I Know to the social impact and it's just you know the classic the impact of a of depression of growth at the time with the world economy was doing reasonably well having a existed that years of conscious\nI also Pasco if he feels a trade war could happen\nThere was a risk of that if you're\nSuffering old miss content is hijacked by pretty decode forces that play it sold a though an analogy kept us all jump on fast or China for us the problems come from a the rest of the world it's a wedding know tendency\nUh we've had a full ages on each bank Rosa there is a scapegoat came to foreign uh protectionism is also seem bleak way of scapegoating that for a non isn't easy temptation so there's a risk no doubt about that\n\nSo symbolic way of scapegoating for enough is an easy temptation so there's a risk no doubt about that\n[noise]\nMuch has changed in the world over the past ten years\nIn some respects the banking sector has been tamed the profitability of the big banks has fallen as has the return on that says [noise] however\nWe're once again seeing the toxic combination of overconfident bank because politicians eager to please versus and lobbyists loose monetary policy\nRising debts and complacent regulators history tells us which is the most common cause of financial crises and precisely the wrong time to weaken bank regulation [noise]\n\nWe should not be allowed into complacency by the strength of global economic growth as this is largely due to high Asian growth rate [noise] the two thousand a crisis stunted because of too much that's\nThe problem has got worse with total exceeding four times the size of the global economy which is a hundred trillion dollars higher than before the last crisis [noise] the u._s._a. and Europe remain highly vulnerable [noise] it used to be said\nThat when the U.S gets a financial cold the rest of the world gets a fever [noise]\nThe rise of Asia has both lifted and stabilize global growth as they are now more growth engines [noise] but as a result of the power shift of the past ten years for all of the five biggest banks in the world are now in China\nCompared to just one of the biggest twenty before the crisis given how important China is now could it be the source of the next financial crisis\nJustin and a leading professor at Peking University brings that these fears are overstated as history has shown China has the ability to prevent crises and manage just domestic that which is guaranteed by the state\nChina so far it's the only country where you now I see the magic crisis in the past forty years\nSo you'd be lucky enough Chuck bakers I think that it's less likely that crash is what you're up in China you bring some corporate that notes that old nominated in China's currency and secondly the corporate that is a high many in that state owned enterprises\nAnd you're not a state owned enterprises\nA guaranteed by the government\nAnd also the ad that used for investment in every effective and that's how they have I said to back no it's kind of that I don't think it's going to be the source of all the crisis and some people predicted [noise]\nI agree with professor Lynn that China is unlikely to be the source of the next crisis [noise]\nMy biggest worry is that the ... crisis has made the rich countries more nationalist undermining cooperation just at a time when risks increasingly ... national borders [noise]\nMeanwhile as a result of the disastrous performance in preventing the financial crisis trust has declined an expert some authorities [noise]\nGet expert advice is needed not only just dumped the next financial crisis but it was to prevent pandemics climate change cyberattacks and other global risk [noise]\nWe need more expertise financial crises are too important to be left to the experts or economists\nCrises impact on all of our lives\nWe need more expertise financial crises are too important to be left to the experts or economists\nCrises impacts on all of our lives in everyone's business\nHistory doesn't repeat itself but sometimes they'll rhythms that we're ... which are clues to the way the future will unfold [noise]\nUnderstand the significance of Christ's [noise]\nFinancial crises have devastating consequences which go far beyond banking [noise]\nOne in many respects the world has recovered economically the political consequences if only recently become shocking evidence in rising extremism and nationalism [noise]\nBy learning from the last crisis my hope is that we can be better informed\nRestore public trust and prevent the next crisis [noise]\nAfter the crash was presented by me in golden and produced by Ben Cox uh MVSA golfing some [noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S is made possible by American public media\nNow and then we have a problem where to go on to the most problem it is where the gums\nI understand even the police station was targeted with an explosive devices\nIn about four or five miles to go over there for\nA bomb ... in in the ... on the for quite a law should bomb but we know who these people are always say that it's about to two hundred people and we know them very well it's about ten to twelve different gangs and they\nGo from gangster gang it's very difficult to understand who is with who\nSo it's it's a huge problem to\nAll these people I worked with this young people when they were very small\nSome people have been ... president of America will say other right wing policies have been saying that that's been an increase in crime in Sweden lots and lots of asylum seekers in in in twenty Fifteen and it it's not his thing is\nIt's a difficult question but you're going to say that most of them raised in this environment is coming from other cancers way\nBack in time is not the most recent immigrants that people who came had hops his children or or even the last second generation in the current\n... it's different ethnic it's not only is Marilyn oh about ... is mixed very mixed the normal aged from Seventeen to twenty three\nTo President Trump and others who say the violence is being carried out by asylum seekers who came to Sweden twin Fifteen around\nThe majority of street gang members or from in the ... crimes that researches he's steady gangs of consent to that what shows many either came to Sweden when they're young from places like Somalia Iraq Palestinian territories in the Balkans oh that parents did\nSo want is the violence abound\n... drugs and most of this shooting at all because they are being insulted in a way\nTo take into a girl friends or given the hits and they\nTake the weapon a shoots before they are\nThe bullets in the navy but the last year they are shooting for killing why haven't gone out interested them if you take this two hundred people were about to tell some conviction about this uh people so what kind of ... driving without a license to smaller drug related other than the\nQuite small things to the most of them of course\nBut it's been very hard to get done for the actual shooting for the killing yes convictions that we're getting behind bars\nRight now nobody talks to the police it's very very hard to get people who is telling what they have seen because it's it's suicide notes or environment [noise]\nSee the fact is serious convictions ...\nSwedish government tightened up along come to the ocean to try to tackle that because it's not only melanoma this is happening firearms stuff becoming more common in Sweden as a home in twenty and laugh in Seventeen people were shot that last year there's more than twice that number\nBut combines is nowhere near the levels seen in the United states we're close to the team\nThere's more than twice that number ... ... is nowhere near the levels seen in the United states we're close to the teen thousand people die from ... in a year\nBut it's alarming people in Sweden we're more used to that country being held up as a kind of Scandinavian social and democratic paradise\nThe problem with Sweet Honey than I think you might like to powder realities that see them as a country's doing very well you know if you look on all the global rankings so even among the top countries but the challenges that we also have a dark reality\nThis is a natural stung me he's both a sociologist and police officer very Swedish combination\nThese bugs are trying to a dream and maybe one of the reasons that made me survive either a goal of becoming a police officer\nAnd there is some cells and immigrant suddenly came to Sweden for around when he was a boy and he grew up learning how to handle himself\nYou know the ... that I was raised up yeah yeah of course people by us and its Weiner's today also ablaze when I was raising a bowl of people in those areas do this all the conflict with guns\nAnd this has crime isn't actually going up in Sweden it's more that it's intensifying in parts of the three biggest cities still come back on Mount ...\nOur problem have not been increasing but our problem are now becoming more and more concentrated in certain areas certain streets and certain population so if you look at for example the homicide rate in Sweden you know the top ... highest rate of homicide was I think Ninety eighty eight\nAnd we were you know two million or twenty percent less population than that we are today\n... characters who speaks up our crime or a serious crime has been changing from you know be previously was quite even distribute ... main name a knife related today is gun related to names is linked to mourn two gangs\nSay well it's causing this new intensifying violence as we were to discover it's a notch Paul the existence of those two realities that are creating the problem Sweden's prosperous country to most people it's very safe place to live with lots of opportunities\nBut not everyone especially not foreigners to come with little money has access to that lifestyle [noise]\nA Fifteen minute drive from the center of mama that the housing estate called Rosen code it's so big it feels like an entirely separate town a Jew cabbage why mess Leslie cuts it's an off those in the seventies it's not a popular place to live [noise]\nIs there a segregated [noise] there what do you mean like there was a there are lots of people are without work well a lot of people that have haven't went to school ... cigarettes in a community worker showed me around and a lot of social welfare takers or to call it ...\nRecipients people don't benefit a lot of immigrants I lost all of a suite of people that have been on social welfare for generations\nSome media reports say it's become so disaffected and tripled a place that it's effectively a no go ahead and\nTalk not trade we were walking around quite freely inside secret who works for an end GMO free Seuss it which runs social projects the young people and tries to help them lead gangs seems to be on friendly terms with all the states\n\n\nAll the states\n\nIs getting married yeah\nUm and how how do you know these guys working with the\nDog was helping him to to get a job and study and he's working now\nAnd the surveys suggested that more than half the students in areas like red and gold just as vulnerable by the government leave school at Fifteen with no qualifications\nBut don't take care of young people jumping out of school like we should\nWe can see it really only\nThe young people that we're getting from all of us ah\nWe don't do anything about it we will come of dozens of apartment blocks were told sometimes as many as Fifteen people live in a flat not full of ... children play areas I'm In a nearby sports home without talking to a young man I met\nGive me\nA slight Eighteen year old with waving Donna Karan ... open face he's presumably tough and then he looks nice getting ready for boxing training he doesn't live on the state but he used to\nThe time I Lived here it was very safe and very normal childhood where we went out to play but then after a time it changed\nWe started the drugs we started the criminals and that's how it is today when did it change do you think you know people became teams and they didn't really\nHave a good time at school some drop early\nThey feel left out so they want to feel accepted and so they go to find smaller groups and slum places you know and and it's all drugs and\nCrime you know do you know anyone friends old friend who've got involved in gangs and that's why they had a friend that started doing that stuff and he was telling me I Know I Will get shot soon and that is feeling is very terrible to live with that\nOh I see it as a trap and you need to move out so I moved out a early age for white wine to Trump will the people here on earth can basically say they will become zombies later they will they will be addicted to drugs they will not be the same friends you had\nShow the hungry young men are a problem in many cities in many countries the added extra in Sweden is that ready access to guns\nThey kill them for it to southern it's a norm or what", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World

Democratic Party supporters gonna do to convince them this time and it\nAll took a took a very high blood including a legislature making it difficult for people that really reaching out for young

then to search team has used some toxic materials to support the blowouts sane\nSo and also due to some sample soil samples from the garden [noise] um yeah those are all a pretty gruesome men

Saudis blame the rogue elements within the state and this argument is also what the President Trump also agrees with parents\nWho we know that President Trump sang it at the beginning of the program

this conflict is rather has rather a global significance and is not only a bilateral conflict with the Saudis\nAnd the Turks I think in this stage turkey has per se you a very clever strategic by bringing ... over international media has been an actor in this conflict because older leagues for me to the international media\nIn terms of the relations turkey wants to have its leverage first overdue Middle East region they still going to have influence and also older the relations between Saudi then turns out to be trained for some time because those turkeys\nUm support or to the Muslim

make this conflict politicized conflict\nSo I think even the statements coming from the Turks um even the United states with Trump saying yeah but the king and the print have denied any knowledge of

she was not going to return safely hey raise some of his piece\nVoiced up by a BBC challenged\nI was recently looking online at the two thousand and Eighteen freedom in the world report published by Freedom House and came to a grave ... there is only one country in the Arab world that has been classified as free that nation is Sunni Shia\nGeorgian more Oakland Kuwait come second with ... partially free the rest of the countries in the Arab world are classified as not free\nAs a result of living in these countries are either uninformed or misinformed they are unable to undo quickly address much less publicly discuss matters that affect the region and their day to day lives\nAs states run negative diminished the public psyche and won many do not believe it's a large majority of the population folds victim to this false narrative sadly the situation is unlikely to change\nThe world was white with hope during the spring of two thousand and eleven journalists academics and the general population were brimming with expectations of a bride and ... our society within their respective countries\nThey expected to be emancipated from the head you many of their government and the consistent interventions and censorship of information\nThese expectations were quickly shuttered these societies either fell back to the old staff at school or faced even harsher conditions than before\nAs a result of governments have been given free rein to continue on and the media that's an increasing rate\nThere was a time when Gen and it's believed the intimate with ... information from the censorship uncontrolled associated with sprint to meet ya but these governments who's very existence relies on the control of Information Act aggressively book the Internet\nThey have also arrested local reporters and pressured advertisers to harm the revenue of specific publications\nThe Arab world is facing its own version of an item courage and impose not extended actors but through a domestic forces vying for power during the Cold War raging Free Europe which grew over the years into a critical institution played an important through in four sitting on sustaining the hope of freedom\nArabs need something similar Arabs need to eat in their own language so they can understand and discuss the value is aspect on complications of democracy in the United states and the west\nIf an Egyptian reason or chicken exposing the actual cost of construction project in Washington than he or she would be able to better understand the implications of similar projects in his or her own community\nThe Arab world needs a modern version of the old trans national media so citizens can be informed about global events\nWe suffered from poverty mismanagement and for education through the creation of an independent international and fooled him isolated from the influence of national governments spreading hate through propaganda ordinary people in the Arab world would be able to address the structural problems there societies face\nThe words of ... show jeeze final column for the Washington Post rummy Hillary as another veteran journalist or the\nThese face the words of ... cheese final column for the Washington Post\nRummy Hillary as another veteran genesis or the hot well he's a professor of journalism at the University of Beirut and a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School to the U.S he knew ... personally\nWent on that theme of the last opinion piece about the state of freedom of expression in our country's freedom of expression\nCertainly was a theme that dominated both his life in mind that are different interactions with both of us had senior positions editing newspapers and magazines and appearing in radio on TV and we constantly try to work through the system in the system\nAnd the autocratic Arab power structures from within to try to push the boundaries on to promote both good journalism and greater a pluralism and freedom of expression and we had very limited success calling for freedom of expression\nA came in a way at the end of his life because he spent most of his life trying to achieve it rather than just speaking out and American newspapers for as he tried to do it on the ground\nHe deed remain on the inside for so long he wasn't as some people I think perhaps of miss that represented in mid a dissident gymnast in that sense\nThe idea of being a dissident journalist is not correct I mean he was a insider who tried to reform the system gradually from within me never tried to ah change it or overthrow it or anything like\nThat but she finally realized when he started speaking out a little bit more especially after ... been stolen came\nTo power a he realized that it wasn't going to happen and what he was doing was no longer tolerate it but he was very much say insider and that's one of the reasons I gather why he was killed I Believe\nHe knew how the system work from within the security system the media system the political system everything when someone's been settled man came into power that was the turning point it's not the dramatic change this that this hour the power structure changed\nHow much been southern man became the first Arab monarch who acted like the\nDictators from you know Syria and Iraq and Libya and Egypt and the former the people all over the world who held all power in their hands that wasn't the way that Markey's ruled a but how might have been some men change that and then when that happened in Saudi Arabia is am I had to leave\nAfter the events of twenty eleven what was initially called the Arab Spring the think now that freedom of expression in the Arab world ease at another point that it was before twenty and then\nNo doubt that freedom of expression and tolerance and pluralism\nAre going backwards and most of the world except for a Tunisia pockets of Beirut and Lebanon where I Lived and um there's very little space and any Arab country for genuine freedom of expression on anything important it's not just media by the way it's university is civil society\nPrivate sector cultural institutions artists every aspect of life is controlled much more tightly by the prevailing power structure so to do anything in the Arab world today in public to express yourself in any meaningful way\nYou need to get the approval of some security officer or some

including England the United states or Russia France or in nobody outside has an any significant way challenge this so we're glad to see people speaking out for their mo but the real question is the wider legacy\nAnd one of the most depressing nine and ... show jeeze final call them was Arabs living in these countries are either uninformed or misinformed he's suggesting it's working\nWell up to an extent so we have now the advent of a satellite media you have the whole Internet of course social media so ordinary citizens who want to know the truth can get it\nThey just can't express it in public and they cannot use that knowledge that they get to actively participate and the political process and the public sphere there's no public sphere and the Arab world\nThere's no public sphere where individuals can debate can talk about serious issues can\nConvince each other and collectively make decisions and the public sphere you're only allowed to to buy fried chicken or cell phones or
