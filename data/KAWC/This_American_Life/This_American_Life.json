[laughter] um that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know\nThe deep thoughts of a young Zionists did he prepared its way to lead his nation [noise]\nNow our our regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this\nDiary ... remain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing it's a lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world's stop worrying about money and wellbeing\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and watch that will generate here comes out of them was on Capitol [laughter]\n[noise] wow [laughter]\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership\n[laughter] no that's a that's a kind of ... and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\nOr a fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] amazing that here I understand your prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably try to run through a site that at some point or there'll be a ball game or something [laughter] end up seeing it you're right exactly [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blamed the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would read it would immediately become design at [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life\nThan that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know\nI'm not just at sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl with them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean maybe\nThe maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation may may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy yeah I think um\nI didn't have much anxious about being the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know it was a good way to deal with ... with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ... um\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would\nFeel it knowing that finally you know an audience of a million people with with getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know\nJust to have your petty little craft and you're petting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself what you're saying though is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at your thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah\nHe would be very very disgusted\nTo be heard this this radio ...\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way\nLike I settled in the ... that are way\nThese days staff writer for the new\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drawing it the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get them to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you've gotten what you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like story from the American life\nNow for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio but this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nDid a story about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity it's a pretty extreme place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people\nTo watch a guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four\nMy friend's got with the top half\n[noise] it was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise] um [noise] got aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad\nAnd [noise] I guess basically got up on a on someone's back and he started yelling and screaming about how giant he was a magnificent and I'm actually right after that I might have gotten a phone back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord in me I thought that was pretty amazing\nI\nBought a lot about it um [noise] at actually good or you know for me thinking along a particular path\n\nTalked about the idea one night in the dining hall the next day on the weight of class\nHe saw signs all over campus that in both pretty\nHigh in nine feet tall continue giant man eight pm on the quad\nScott had no idea who put them up\nHe learned later that the giants were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nGot decided he would go to the cloud at the time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in a costume for the giant\nGiant man of blooming boy\nI don't even know exactly it was something like you know I Am trying you know just the you know loud but just kinda weird [noise] you know sort of [noise]\nAdjusting [laughter] way though I don't know and\nGot to college friend who does access giant man's leg\n...

one that had been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and uh that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but uh\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but um [noise]\nI Would be devastated if I heard anything different\nThere are parts of the past

think that's what I did was try to play\n\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story how little I remember as a deceived that's about each other even if they had to seem to us about

clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel [laughter] to me [laughter]\nUm that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know the the thought of a young Zionists did he prepared is way to meet his nation [noise]\nNow our our regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this diary\nRemain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing at the lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world stop worrying about money and wellbeing\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out will generate here comes Adam\nContinues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out will generate here comes to add on on Capitol [laughter]\n[noise] wow [noise] [laughter]\nIt's interesting that you actually are

we'll say\nIf he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see I mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] amazing that you're in your prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably try to fund for sites that at some point or there'll be a ball game or something they never sent you right exactly [laughter] [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blamed the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy\nOf you know I'm not just at sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but\nI don't know I mean maybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy yeah I think um I didn't have much anxious about being\nThe future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much ... every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know it was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ...\nI Wonder what the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people with with getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nI was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know just to have your\nPetty little craft and you're putting little family and your small little apartment like\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself when you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah\nHe would be very very disgusted\nTo be heard this this radio peace\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way\nThese days staff writer for the new\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and

using her little micro cassette answering machine and then\nTo edit the quotes that she had gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like a story from this American Life\nNot for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio for this week's show have ... we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like a story on our show\nIs history that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nTypes university it's a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of

about how Jayanti was magnificent and uh [noise] like I say right after that I might have gotten back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh [noise] I guess that really struck a chord had heard that was pretty amazing\n\nThey bought a lot about it um [noise] it actually good or you know start making a lot of [laughter] a peculiar pap [noise]\n\nTalked about the idea one night in

Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator and here to tell you that's not a true story that's not what changed it to my [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview\nJust leaks fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nDashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get the elevator to get to the vote\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination was confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and\nCrumbled ... was one of the two women and that confrontation as senator play good morning good morning when that elevator dorm close to where the Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't and I'm reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn online site support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days [noise] lots of people love this version

Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nHere this morning that they have also\nWe talked about it was ... and there was a it was a thing\nIt's not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with us a war hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake\nSupport what do you believe in one way and therefore we believe women have the same manner saying what do you have to say please [noise] something you can say the winning right now in the survivors\nJust the day before Lincoln I got in an elevator on the

to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge cabinet I'm\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just isn't sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that area and we are Twenty one very imperfect senators\nTrying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today and uh and just have a little humility on that front so\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because you can't understand what happened at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the four cabinet testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't off putting to him as I thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a boat and that's been let's just\nHad a debate for staff discussions late last night too and\nWe like politicians we we feed on a\nAdmitted in a\nAnd then it happened it's just like he predicted\nAfter seven

report was a disgrace basically they didn't follow up on any leads the said it was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am
