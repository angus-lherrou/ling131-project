rhetoric and attacks have been on the rise so give us a sense that that put that in contact since and how shocked you buy that\nWhile I think I was horrified my organization the country was horrified\nBy what happened yesterday but unfortunately in some ways we weren't necessarily surprised a deal on the frontlines of fighting hate for over a hundred years been tracking anti Semitic incidents\nFor for decades and what I can tell you is in twenty six teams we saw a thirty four percent increase access harassment vandalism and the violence against the Jewish community\nLast year eight fifty seven percent increase single largest surge that we've ever seen an anti Semitic acts in the United states [noise]\nAnd so this event that happened yesterday this terrible tragedy and our hearts break\nThe break for the families and the victims and the community\nBut let me tell you we should not look away what anti Semitism is on the rise to act\nAnd secretary Johnson I Know the idea of so this week showed a marked increase in online attacks against the Jewish community as we get closer to election day when you look at those statistics when you hear what Mr ... just said what is your sense of what's happening in the country\nFor smart for all Americans this morning should mourn me with the families of the eleven year old who were members of the tree of life is going to

that our leaders lead a secretary Johnson said\nEncouraged that the president said something yesterday the country needed to hear that but it is and what you say after the tragedy that only matters the environment that you create with your rhetoric and the ... we have spoken out one candidate Trump for President Trump\nHas invoked anti Semitic means and use the kind of rhetoric favored by white supremacist\nBut I think we also need to keep in mind and we'll keep doing that will keep speaking truth to power\nThought it's more than one man does whether you're an elected official meeting with Nazi sympathizers or bringing costs deniers to the house of representatives\nOr if you're in luck or candidate for office invoking wild anti Semitic conspiracy theories about\nJewish financier George

strategist former DNC chair Donna Brazil um nice at the top the shall we shouldn't be surprised by this all the events in this week we're the inevitable um\nI I think we should be surprised at something like this takes place in America and the course of the last week but I think much of its been predictable and this and with the times we're in and where we are today I'll quote the philosopher Yoda\nWhich says that pat the dark side is fear fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to suffering and I think we're at a moment in time where we have to speak passionately clearly and calmly and and the times that we're in and I think our leaders and I would put specific responsibility on the president\nThat he has an obligation to try to read us so much of this tribalism and I think what he's done\n'em over the course of the last few years has helped form at this I'm not saying he's responsible for what happened in Pittsburgh is not responsible for what happened with the with the bombs that were sent he's responsible what happened with at the supermarket but all of those have commonality\nA white nationalist sub pharmacist shot to blacks at a supermarket white nationalist supremacists set Seventeen I eat these across the country to democratic leaders are white nationalist supremacist just killed eleven Jewish people in a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAnd in the course of that I think the president has not actually allocated resources to deal with it in the right way\nAnd he also has not spoken in the right way in the course of this that has diminished the eighth time\nHe had to work on domestic terror when you worked for president of the homeland security adviser how to respond\nWell I'm saddened to hear it all to be even this morning the lead into this was a focus on the part of the comments as he walked out a helicopter instead of the focus on the court I was hoping to see what she condemns anti Semitism and violence in this country is so hard to claim it got a big on the same way to make up for that was\nHis first response and that was his instinct is response to what happened what what do you then set in the speech was that was scripted\nFare and I don't believe that's accurate first off he has control over what scripted knows me knows you're saying that wasn't accurate that was his first or smile because it wasn't his first response was on his way out of response to a question throw it to him about gun control so the question was already political reporters and a dad or Sam what are your thoughts on gun control response to this issue\nIs actual response to the American people was that we have no tolerance for violence in this country or anti Semitism to the U.S whether you play it or not agree with me or not that's what I Would have ...\nTom when the child has an absolute parents\nThe other parents steps up their siblings steps up so that when the country has gone through a lot of pain and strike you look for the president to be that parental sick\nAnd yesterday I think at that moment when he was not the parent we need it he was not the person that she'll let's talk about the pain\nHe runs away from his responsibility as the leader will lead us we all have voices and his boss just a ... at the moment like this a mom and George when our leaders our former presidents with all of their party they were elected by the ...\nWell leaders our former presidents regardless of their party they were elected by the entire American people their their lives were at stake the lives of our attorney general the lives of members of Congress and the lives of people who are just regular people or people in the media people\nAt the table when you're talking to voters days away from the very important election if what they say if the country is in need of repair\nAnd what they want is a repairman for repair woman to fix this and I think the twenty twenty elections going to end up on this point people\nDo say that but do they do was\nTo back up what they say is one of my question\nDepends on who we're giving them and I think this is one of the key questions for twenty twenty is who who are the Democrats would then yes I think is right now we're still in our two camps and right now it's about getting them bowed out for this side or the side and it's either you're with this whole election day comes about Trump or you're with them or you're against them and then we'll see about how the turnout but\nThen they get back to the question what responsibility to political leaders have to encourage that and not have the opposite so there's so\nMany that are both sides moment I think anybody that that actually acts like this is both sides moments the president has a special responsibility at times like this I think the country out there as a whole is not as tribal as just what Washington is doesn't do politics the same as the president does does an access those two levels of pay\nAnd and discourse that he does but the president has a special ... per se possibility I'm not Michelangelo but I can paint by numbers and when you put string together the president's actions and use string together the president's words and use string together all those things he's done let's not forget to vet that what happened in Pittsburgh\nWas because was ... the man was radicalized\nBecause of the language of Hebrew immigrant aid society he was mad that refugees and immigrants forgive and we're giving sport ever he considered special privileges in the course of this and lead referenced the caravan let's let's also not forget that within this week\nThe president probably claimed himself a nationalist and proudly castigate the immigrants struggling families the refugees\nThat are walking miles and miles and as he does that not all Americans most Americans are good people and all that the president in my view the president has to come to terms with this and come to terms with his own responsibility and where we are as a country today\nJust briefly just not very much debris with and what you said what we should not lose sight of the fact\nThat this awful villains is someone who accused the president of being part of the Jewish conspiracy someone who sees the president has a global list was seeking to destroy the country\nAnd this is someone who is a noxious poisonous person believed ideas that unfortunately did not begin with one president or another anti Semitism pervasive dangerous threat and nations around the world instead of not Louis so it's not a whole lot why is it dramatically\nIn the last two years and the reason why he castigated the president this man was because he didn't think the president hated enough she didn't think the president was anti immigrant enough that's why he was mad at the president he thought the president was back in the bashing immigrants more\nThan ... more than I wanted and the fact that you have Jewish members of his administration were absolutely central to his larger political project he was deeply suspicious and I don't think you can really attribute this man's hateful is solely to one political party or another we\nYou know I I think a lot of the you know these ball players got to tell you the system still might be broken and and I I don't necessarily disagree\nWith that but you know what\nSome of these other players may have to get to that point you know as most and bet on yourself that's what we know is doing by the end up but he's going to be around what ten eleven million dollars if he is able to reach a lot of these plateau is depending on if it's it's\nIs able to reach a lot of these plateau is depending on if it's starting or relieving or closing where if he's again if he's the closer you know none of us are saying that's going to happen but he has\nPut some of those incentives in the contract where it if it works out and let's be honest it's not like the cardinals have a guaranteed closer right now\nAnd if Adam when rights not going to start\nAnd he's throwing like he did the end of this past season I wouldn't completely dismiss the notion of Adam Wainwright as you're closer I I just think some of these other big league ball players that are are putting a tight spot and Wainwright water been in a tight spot if he's elected to try and\nUh sell his services elsewhere nobody was going to go out there and give them any guaranteed money\nHe stayed here in St Louis and he's got a chance to ah to make pretty decent coin if he comes through\nI'm not the biggest fan of the winter I signed up for the money it's totally worth it you think of someone like little ... going to be making more that way right the next year to me that's all you need to know\n[laughter] I don't I don't know why you wouldn't be a fan of it I I what\nWhat else do you want them to give an opportunity at a guy that's been a career cardinal you would hate for his career to end anywhere else and to me well enough to take a chance the more pitching depth you have the better I don't think there's anything\nWrong with it I just worry that sense as Adam Wainwright that he's gonna get chances that he shouldn't casual treatment\nNow then and that's and that's a fair point but I I I don't think that's the way it's going to go with this particular with this particular team I think we're past that\nBut the hope his door for you okay if he doesn't work a starter forever middle reliever let's put it in in the eighth inning let's wait and I think you get a last chance this now to put him in places you have ... where you have fought before he will say hell no\nYou got Wainwright I'm starting pitcher now he's done to you I Am I re I'm and Wainwright type pitcher dies willing to pitch where wherever you want to put me wherever I go with to help the team win knowing or received a buddy in the postseason\nAnd and I think for a lot of guys you think 'cause I'm a reliever it almost I think a lot of guys in it but there was a time sort of recently where if you're a reliever was almost an insult if you're starting pitcher ham a stark\nYou've watched baseball here the last couple of years\nAre pitching in late relief it's pretty darn important even if you're not the closer and Wainwright saw that\nPart related and ... and was able to lay out some incentives were if he is a reliever\nAnd if he's a good reliever I mean heck if if you're if you're appearing in fifty or fifty five or sixty games probably means you've been a pretty effective and you've been durable at the same time and and Wayne writes gonna get winter it's going to get credit for that\nIs probably the best case scenario he helped to win any are there other any any ... got to say the\nWorst case scenario he just collects two million dollars and it's a good ... bench go just like that so the team doesn't lose as because there are enough or paying for a a superstar days if final year of a player less but frankly this is a swan song I think\nAnd yeah it's it's it's perfect storm for my what might be a good season for the cardinals us like that\nAnd you're absolutely right and we'll see how it all plays out but I think it's at this point anywhere really nothing but good news on the Adam Wainwright front let's hit one more little sports\nEarlier today sent a Jordan guy rue option to him about a scientific way back to their eight H. L. affiliate in San Antonio\nKyrie was one of those guys you had some really high expectations for because of how we played in the summer and the way he played in the blues minor league organization last year he uh did log in the ... and a couple of penalty minutes but the twenty year old not logging quite enough time to really be\nFeatured on any one blues line right now so you send him back down on a week where you're going to see a lot of\nInjured blues comeback or be at ... be at a shows cut off who is set to come back as well the lady who show could be part of the equation later this week and of course Gunderson is close to being healthy as well blues are\nJust I mean losing jak gallons of being hit but other than that defense but in Fort words you're about as close to being whole as as you're going to be is a big deal\nYet I think it's ... I think it's great that someone like probably February is basically going to he could apply again I mean we we didn't know if you'd ever play again after suffering too devastating ACL injuries and back to back season but how many times you hear a player coming back in those situations\nNot very many and I'm just I'm just anxious to see what he is who he is and because his game was about speed and it's and it's been being explosive\nIs that it does any remnants of that players still exist or can you rely on some of these you know his hockey skill set to change the type of player he is we're gonna we're gonna find out here real soon I'm anxious to see what\nThat looks like a ton other hand you have to feel sorry for feel bad for Jordan Cairo ... who I don't think he was given a fair look I mean he seemed like if he was playing well he would get bumped up to a different line if he wasn't playing while he been pumped out to different line he never seemed like he had a set\nPartnership with two other guys on the ice who he could could play with every single game I don't know if he got a fair look\nI think he's going to be okay and then you'll be back sooner rather than later [noise] ah I told you got because he has potential\nI don't disagree and I hope it's not a trend that we've seen with young players in the past where suddenly you just shut them off and you don't hear from them again and then you wonder well you just didn't live up to expectations while he's hardly played\nAnd hopefully he gets another opportunity sooner rather than later for the blues begin to Jake gallon situation up in the air and we we talk about the you know defense men and forwards you're just about all\nIt almost gives Mike your stay of execution for a while because you can't really judge this team without your starting goal to enter for who show comes in and just sets the world on fire and takes care of a lot of doubt because as of right now that there's ... ... gallons your guy almost by default\nJustice has blues ... and all over who's going to come into play well and they like uh what do we do [laughter] I\nWon a hundred percent agree this to me has got a lot of intrigue written all over it and all of the will is one game for who's going out there and starting [noise] you know given up a goal or are pitching a shutout and and the blues boost Twitter will go nuts lose fan base is going to lose their mind\nHe if he doesn't need to screw it up you doesn't screw it up so I got to see what happens\nIs that right what what ... what what are you going to screw up the seems awful [laughter] they don't give up and go oh there's there's zero pressure on who's a hero awful\nThing that the blues are shown off is the defensive side so yeah so\nEither he and I I I Want to nip that in\nThe site so yes so either he and I I I Want to nip that there because that's their their scoring goals partly because they're selling out on scoring they're they're they've become lackadaisical on these and this is self imposed\nFor the most part like yeah you still have the Cold War here defensively ... defense lawyers from the new they're they're very ... and it's basically so I get the officers struggle at early early this season but they got fixed three games\nPoint being is that she comes in and there she's not feeling some huge shoes Jake gallon on now is the guy but she's been just a guy really just been OK and a lot of that is because the defense has been awful\nLately you been able to give him more over ... but now it's got a shot to come in there and start and I'm telling all that will take is one game for him to go out there and you make thirty stays in the blues winter to wander ... you know one nothing dean this thing will turn on its head immediately and [laughter]\nIt'll make life for a Mike yo and and dug Armstrong difficult in a different sense to be a good problem to have but we saw this good problem last year and you still didn't make the Stanley Cup playoffs was all said and done\nThat just has to have trouble and all of our to me I think [noise]\nI don't know if it blues it's so blues where you can say hey you can have a goal in golden or come in and step up and you think it's a bad thing because it's going to cause a ... a bunch of\nA a a bunch of chaos inside the room nobody want nobody's looking forward to it but I'm telling you what they need somebody to step up\nBecause right now I Do the hawks you you said last week he's in the hawks all they do is give up golds that granted Crawford had been back and had been better but that to me that doesn't tell me a whole heck of lot Saturday Night the boys have been able to score goals", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Big Sports Show", "city": "Saint Louis", "day":

a huge deal\nIt is a huge deal and it tells you which direction the programs moving I think to me you know there's there's things called signature wins\nAnd if you want to say that Kentucky doesn't count as one I think there's an argument to that look Missouri's favored in this game um so that let's keep that in mind they usually has a pretty good sense of what's going on but also you know they're all suffering from the country and they played very good football this season I I've been a Kentucky since the season started\nAnd and you know they if they have continued to deliver\nThe message that they're not to be taken lightly so the meeting the right team is a big deal and the fact that Barry autumn has not been able to do it is a big deal um there's only one player on this team

aware really one of the games that was a kind of a flip game could have gone [noise] either way uh with with South Carolina and then the other two we you know didn't play well enough to come on those games and\nMail bam I did and and and so to speak to the Georgia so we were hungry to get back in the winter circle a you know we needed it and we needed it\nNot only that we had to buy weekend there so it was really for weeks that's a long time and um [noise]\nIt's our guys were excited I was happy for them or they have prepared they've stayed the course man and the result of that as an opportunity to to be four in three and have have a chance to to go play a at home again against a really good uh Kentucky came\nSo it's you know you mentioned with ... you know after the game you know the fact that you guys put up all those points but you also feel like there's still enough to work on be at the penalties are I guess that's number one the list ... does it feel good that you can win a game like that we know when you've still got to work on\nWell we've still um you know I think we can be a much more complete football team than we've been there's been times that that would've been a about where I thought we would be but we haven't done it yet consistently and all three phases\nTogether for for um at the at the highest level so [noise] um I mean you're always striving for that next step in and this week will will be not not anything different than our prepare\nA like like everything is dependent on it and then and then go cut loose and play and we know that we need a plate of our best to to give herself as an opportunity\nTo jump or was it just starts fast as you talked about for several weeks you like to get the grades started maybe forcing a terminal over to a or getting that big play and certainly you did\nYeah I think it was important specifically this week um because of what the other team their their ability to allow fence to score points\nUm [noise] the there are a number of\nThings that we talked about going into the game and one of them was was getting out to a fast start and you want that to happen and and most certainly did for [noise]\nFor our team on on Saturday afternoon and and you know I think of the game of momentum as is very very strong and\nEspecially in in college ball or when you have that you got to find ways to keep it and when when you don't have it on your side line then you you've got to find a way a one play at a time to battle back and hang in there\nCoaches Kentucky comes to town Saturday you know they're coming off the fourteen standing win against standard will is there something about the way they played it lends itself to low scoring football games\nWhile they're really really good on ... and you look at any category a statistically there there are one or two in every category and I and our league and I that's that's saying something\nAnd then often simply on the line of scrimmage they have been\nAble to take control of every game and they run the ball extremely well they don't turn it over their quarterback trauma is is super athletic I can make all kinds of plays\nExtending drives doing things that a real good quarterbacks new and they've got a a good a one two punch at Tel back is as anybody in the country and you know they don't have any problem if if they run the ball on first down and ended up in a second six\nYou know that's a win because uh you know it's this for yards and um they they like and trust the ability on the way that their team has built a to play that game\nAnd when you play in Alabama you knew that you'd probably see appear quarterbacks\nI'm On Saturday with a\nJury Wilson in ... you went to Spain to go to ... may employee both\nDied I assure you know watching all

mentioned it ah with the Wildcats come in in ... kicks Saturday what are you guys have to do to come away with the winner gets huge Windsor your team\nWhy they went into play well number one after we get through the week of preparing the right way then you've got to go execute the game plan will be there uh the opportunity for us to go stand drives off eventually find ways to be\nA fishing on third downs and then get down on the red area and come away with what touchdowns\nWe've got to take care of the football ... defensively or going to have to be able to to contain and and\nAs much as you can eliminate a the run game um that that's what they're ... that's what they want to do [noise] we can't we can't just let Dr keep going and going to go on because we can't stop the run but then as important as that you can't sell out on the run and give up exposure plays in the past game\nWe got to find a way at the end of the day we need to be a plus in the turn of origin and do that then

Georgia for number one in the SEC east\nAfter entered with only fourteen to but\nThat was sort of guilt the what the explanation was it was forty second\nAnd made it fairly cold and all that stuff and it's only the Terry well quarterback losses cop as as a pastor he looked like a world leader literally against Ford thrown at short notice it\nBut since then they become really hasn't had to pull the trigger to because it afraid to throw in other fix or something like that and then\nThey didn't want to put him in a bad spot against the law and so\nIt's all kind of built into this little quarterback controversy and now the backup quarterback got sports there is a down here\nBut he saw the guy that wouldn't be surprised that they actually I guess\nYou extract I mean you you said you wouldn't be surprised who are resisting would Gabriel from because aren't the broadcast a is so it is is Margaret either to maybe a turn to maybe plane I like to quarterback type system\nI don't know but I think they might make time for him I think what's going to happen is going to depend on how many plays\nHe can run they've had a couple of games\nThey've either turned it over score quickly that many plays that many series\nBut I don't think it'll be the kind of thing where they take anybody I think it'll be you know maybe put him out on the third set a downs or maybe if they're struggling or whatever they got a got a nice are against it from Michigan and they open\nTo throw a touchdown pass\nSo we're really for the games have been tight we haven't seen him in a mop up or anything so are\nYou know it it might be a free thing or am I just they might just do it by field but the wildcard there is and I've asked about this for the for the quarterback throws a cage that stuffing I was not given any snow\nHow difficult is that they said something to consider but they said we have to be balanced we can't just wonderful and when and the FCC stick\nTo Kentucky number twelve in the country total these\nCc stick\nTo Kentucky number twelve and a country total decent one makes decent show good\nGosh the quarterback\nSidelined back here in the spring or these critical athlete you know getting guy's\nWaist he was sixteen he looks like he ways to twenty five is one of those guys guys look like that in younger days this year I'd put any of that is just now\nFor people to forget

and the kid is that what we're looking at a really nice year but the most important thing of all over the last four years they had a kid who's just didn't work out\nSounding the Alabama for recruiting office\nBut he never became a really good that she will now you're up there last spring when Clinton Hannah knows guard\nSecond tier team in the SEC ease tendency pay as that bottom feeder ... they did this just maybe that spot\nWhere they've liberals because for the balls to go in there to Columbia South Carolina and pull off this when I I mean I'm not sure what we've learned out of this but in terms of pecking order I think this game tells us a lot Saturday Night\nI I agree I think I think South Carolina wins that one I really think Tennessee hit its high water mark with us when at Auburn\nAnd not to discredit ... that's a big win that's the kind of when that Germany Pruitt can point to it's kind of when that let's be honest with very old I'm Still looking for the want a new coach can say look this is this is what we do here and it might take some time but but this is you're seeing here seen glimpses of the sunshine\nThrough the clouds and and I don't know that Tennessee\nIs a I don't know that South Carolina's all that good but I I really just don't think that much of Tennessee this year they got a big win at Auburn yet crushed by Alabama reality sets back in there is some friction down there you got Jeremy ... called out his team for not being ... having a roster that's not prepared to play Alabama\nI'm it's some tough times down in Knoxville they got a one to build off on I don't think they're going to get another\nThat I'll tell you what looking at the bottom of the user division and to think that there's not a whole lot of strength and I hate to say right now Missouri's in that their own three in the SEC so when you look at Tennessee Missouri and Vanderbilt\nThere's one when ten losses with those three teams and so if someone that'd be that'd be\nYeah somebody's got to be guided by the word order out and and I would agree the that sort of see when a earlier a jets probably going to be yet\nNot a lot of national championship implications your fellows protects the CNN and Mississippi sinking Saturday Night uh down in ...\nMississippi states favored by two and a half a ton I mean a ton of action in on taxes and as we sit here right now they are the popular back in this game I was really disappointed\nIn ... Mississippi State later huge a sort of right off the ballot Fitzgerald turned up all over at first driving LSU in by your bangles really did not let up\nOr down in Baton Rouge and again I I've been one that has been bought into LSU but\nFor a guy that everybody everybody was really hot detract from Mississippi State at the start of the year with Nick Fitzgerald being one of those you know a senior leader quarterbacks a veteran to be ... to me Mississippi State spin a bit of a disappointment this year and they can't beat\nTaxing am I'm not sure they have a really any opportunities left now um I guess they still do they still play Alabama maybe they do I'm not sure there are opportunities for a realistic Markey when I think they're running out of them to be honest with\nYou I think the fans are start bill um are going to be holding those call bills are going to be a whole lot of cowbell noise a sucker against a un out\nI think they're going to need a little more cowbell and not have enough I Am looking at you know three straight wins and they haven't been pretty but they've been three in a row they got their their tail whip at Alabama they came out they beat Arkansas they beat Kentucky in overtime\nAnd then they just beat South Carolina on the road on the road again I think I think jumbo it's not it's not greased up like he wanted like he will Abbott eventually but he's got a role in a little bit right now not\nYou know jumbos got a to point loss to clumps and that they very well could have one at home\nOh it's got a to point loss to Columbus and that they very well could have one\nAt home I Do but they also they weren't exactly embarrassed by Alabama forty five to twenty three or a few weeks back and he's got three straight wins you talk about ... early well maybe your chance to get you both Fisher has already passed yeah specially\nFrom Mississippi State team is lost three of us less for you that there are just a\nBig time disappointment down there uh for me in stark ville um anything else you get not a lot that stands out in the FCC this weekend other than those games dandy that Arkansas felt let's talk about um talk about the bottom feeders to me Arkansas\nArkansas shown a lot and the Vanderbilt defense again good they again they went toe to toe with Kentucky this past weekend and hung in there until the until the very bitter and I do kind of like Arkansas in this game although it is important to note\nThat the line has a really swung in this game Arkansas opened up two and a half point favorites there now point and a half\nDog to give you an idea that a lot of the action early came in on Vanderbilt not a lot of implications but again for Arkansas two teams are predictably would being hidden in the opposite opposite direction first year coach down in Arkansas but\nYou have to wonder if ... is it just isn't his swan song in Nashville\nYeah I'll take the doors and this one ... I think the defense is going to be able to go and I won't be pretty end up could very well come down to the end but I'll go Vanderbilt\nIs a crazy wiccan is you see when you don't have Alabama Auburn New donor that was the right you don't have an old ... you know you got for us it's just one of those weekends of the conference words for the soft\nWho is Missouri and uh obviously Kentucky the moral as well as Florida in Georgia in Jacksonville\nFor me the biggest game out of the FCC fellows it's two thirty in the big tent Iowa at Penn State a hawk guys blanked Marilyn this past weekend I was still in the mix for the Big Ten west in fact Iowa\nNorthwestern Wisconsin and now Purdue after being you know I say they are all in play all still mathematically very much alive for the Big Ten championship game for Iowa do they play a brutal scheduled down the stretch your starting here with Penn State\nUm can do the Hawkeye stand a chance on the road\n[noise] ah I don't know it's a toss up for me I mean this is a this is one right I Can't I have a hard time picking it so when I have a hard time picking that I picked the home team thing and then I'm going to\nPenn State Penn State getting a Penn State six and a half points favorites uh over the Hawkeye here do you like I'm I'm surprised you know Penn State pick preseason top ten obviously I I was going up but I you there's almost looks to me like a line that should be double digits in in favor of Penn State it's not one\nOf the house they went in there to happy belly and and the buckeyes they'll go through that\nYou know everybody goes and looks like Alabama buckeyes way for the national championship and of course last week had no idea that was going to take place and then there are some other things I guess going beyond\nThe seeds in Columbus and you ... you know we're we're not going to need to know but I I don't see I don't see\nParents said losing that happy valley again to Iowa\nI like Penn State and I was a different team away from Iowa City this looks to be again the Penn State could roll but we've seen stranger things the Iowa defense has been legit so far haven't really played anybody but this is their chance to get that Markey when\nAt Purdue goes on the road ...

of approaching Halloween are what's going on is weird weird like why well a good friend of mine in North east Missouri\nOh I'd trust doesn't drink until\nAfter [laughter] now I'm thinking it might have been small beer [noise]\nI don't know I had a friend one time or take me to a spot and show me a beer and it turned out to be the biggest lever I've ever seen in my life and I have to admit it did look like a fair but it wasn't big enough to be scary but this guy\nNow you know he he knows what he's looking at things where we didn't walk like a bird in like a very so who knows [noise]\nI don't know what to tell you on that one or maybe he just fell asleep watching duck dynasty and uncle side was telling us Black Panther story\nWell you know sometimes that inside of your eyelids the

all day [laughter] you know normally we have that October loan and uh\nIt's just a\nUm they just they disappear for like seven to ten days and I I just haven't been seeing the lawless year it's weird\nBut I think it's going on now myself you know getting on on the older little black box here\nI didn't see as many deer photos from this weekend as they did last week at a little bit early people may not be posted in quite yet but it looked to me like last weekend and I talked to maybe a half a dozen hunters and they swear they didn't see the movement that they saw last weekend and the strange thing is it's colder this weekend and it was last weekend\nAnd the moon's getting up there pretty big hit in the I Believe it's a waxing givens you know you can tell me what that is because I don't remember [laughter]\nWack wack\nSeeing given moons so I I don't know and I I Know what a given the monkey is I think\nWell that's what I was going to say I was going to know I Know there's a given monkey but I our our uh waxing given moon I don't know if I die\nI well we need some astrologers to call on them you know not that I care because I'm not up there in the dark right now anyway

holding their mouth writer you're not junior them on the right side of your mouth or something starts in the fish to bite\nSo like it was twenty eight degrees this morning that the Oscar you guys\nKnow cause it was ten degrees I mean I you know it's just they're going to eat this time of year they're trying to eat as much as they can\nWrite right okay and the water temperature water temperature changes as the day goes on to Iran or late in the Ozarks was sixty six degrees\nYesterday morning and in the afternoon it was sixty eight degrees now I'm telling you that very very surface of the water\nBut my recommendation if you can afford one wants to get we start talking about expensive lures but we're talking about eight or ten bucks to twenty bucks a whopper plop or it's just

I don't say Maxwell and doing All right you and I had a date earlier this week we went to go see\nHalloween because you were on my case about this for about six months max you have to take me to this movie\nBS I was I'm a big ... grew up watching it as a child and I was very excited for them to do a sequel not a remake to the original one and yeah I Want to talk about it with you on your show today\nSo you and I are sort of the um exception to the rule most people have seen Halloween hundreds of new John Carpenter classic one of the best slugger pictures of all time just I think I voted in three different format to love that film I watched a million times\nHowever very few people have ruined the gauntlet of watching every single Halloween spinoff remake side pool sequel\nAnd you and I have ... we shared an office and we realize that when we're talking about all the different sequels and prequels in cycles that we've seen all of them and even the bad ones I think we've enjoyed a little bit\nJust a little bit I mean I like the Halloween five revenge Michael Meyers you seem not to like it I kind of agree with you it's one of the worst in the stadium or if they're out there doesn't explain a lot\nYou're a big age too old fan I Am Jamie Lee Curtis is she's back in this movie and I think it helps the franchise out a lot\nCan we agreed that the best Halloween films as a rule involved Jamie Lee Curtis\nAbsolutely because you have for dinner and you know hairs and the general Harrison four or five and she wanted to come back with six but they recast or for that was probably for the best\nSixers are one of the worst ones but of course she was also in Rob zombies Halloween Halloween to try to do that you told me that rose like wow that she wasn't so she's been in for as well or dental Harris has been in for Halloween films as Jimmy lord\nAccumulate Curtis as worry strode has been enforced and it was in Halloween\nHalloween to back in the seventies eighties and then of course ... and H Forero which is really what they should have called this one which is called Howard [noise]\nGet downstairs [noise]\n[noise]\nTo explain the people the concept that uh the daily McBride uses screenwriter here because I'm very surprised she wrote that he's he's a comedy guided this is the end of your high and there's a lot of really funny films but he loves and held in franchise like like you and I have many teamed up with his good friend David Gordon Green threat who directed pineapple express which he was also in\nAnd out to do this new version of Halloween to explain the people have this is different than the other shops\nOr this one is different because this one is a pretty much a sequel to the very first one so you can cut out Halloween to back in Nineteen eighty one I Believe all of them\nAnd that is a very major distinction because yes what happened in Halloween to\nUh and that one just they were revealed that they are brother sister didn't return is Laurie Strode and mark on Mars or brother and sister and this one they ...\nThey are not relate as the first time that that's been scratched up because every other timeline and yes it's very confusing but the foreign timeline would they know Harris still had a family\nConnection robs zombies to ... made the family connections huge runners and of course even ... her brother so this is the very first time since the early eighties and that they have not been related to me it's a head scratcher\nMichael mind seeing them being killed his sister\nIt's a head scratcher Michael my scene and being killed his sister when he was six years old and he came out to eat just tell you why we want to get him inside his mind\nMichael Meyers murdered five ... he's a human being we need to understand a transfer\nAnd happy not to ... to the ... the idea that already we saw him\nAnd I think he might speak with you\nThis second one is because it's a it's a it's a head scratcher like it really is because it's one of those movies where there's nine previous Halloween films\nBut I I don't understand the motivation of erasing the family bought\nAnd to uncover is involved in this movie for the first time since that second film back in the early eighties or use executive producer here you also does the film score he also did this war for that first and second how in film\nAnd my favorite aspect of this movie is that score is really wonderful I'm there it's a ominous moody and are really helps the movie when when the movie isn't great the music always is and\nI I like the ... of all the original score of this because it picks up a little bit you know the results growing Halloween it's very slow very frightening but this one actually picks up a little bit of some drums behind it picks up and because if you if you watch the movie Michael Meyers\nIs not as slow as we know that he's very fast paced this time around and he's really out to kill a lot of people and they even said back in Seventy eight you'll you'll five people ... he\nHe pretty much doubles that troubles that almost think\nSo he's trying to think I was thinking of it might be right around that same number I was thinking five or six I think so you get a lot I'd have to really think about it until about five people in that first first time you ... you and I were talking about how this movie would be received a very differently and I think I think it will do well as the box office but it would be received very differently\nHad we not had any sequels ever if this was a very first movie after forty years to involve Michael Meyers\nGilead cheering in the aisles and a true enough at the screen that we saw at the Esquire people wearing Michael Meyers shirts somebody to even get in here where the line around the block so the anticipation for this is awfully high and I think some younger audience members might\nNot realize the Jamie Lee Curtis came back Twenty years ago for age to older and they're so excited to see her back now how is she in this film proceeds phenomenal she's a great actress and she's a great once again as a slightly different more hinge Dolores roads\nWhat's terrifying that meant that there is no rhyme or reason that really it is nothing he is nothing in in that ... that and they get mad at [noise]\nIs they embody mental pure evil and that's why it's so terrifying\nYou have the younger generation aren't used to it and it also pays tribute to the older generation because you had the grand daughter and she's an only in high school and they had this like get together party over at the high school and it kind of pay tribute to resurrection a little bit so I don't know if you noticed that\nAnd then you know the older generation Jamie Lee Curtis in her daughter who kind of pays the whole image of the Halloween four or five and six a little bit\nThey're boys so uh yeah because in this film Laurie Strode Jimmy ... I'm ... obsessed with the ah the babysitter murder of Michael Meyers which they didn't name check in the movies or the shape at one point answer her daughter's taking away from her by child services\nWhich is sort of similar to what happened to the character Jimmy lord played by Denzel Harris and the foreign trilogy a but here she's played by Judy Greer who is an actress also known for comedy and that that that is why I'm a dentist McBride wanted to her because she could do something more dramatic here and she's fine she has a standup scene towards the end it I'm not going to spoil here at all [noise]\nUm until March Madness and that's why not get that it's all good but\nI just I I feel for everybody associated with this with this tiger basketball program April second to the fourth\nIs is about for the tournament that I teach tournament April ... the two finals\nOh yes that's a final okay ... and again and and obviously down to Madison Square garden right cause us to say when I started I think it's like a day or two after a selection Sunday I think it's a day I finally started to say but anyway\nTo after a selection Sunday I think it's a day I finally started that Tuesday but anyway there is this a few again it day here and there were there's no basketball maybe around Christmas Time to think there's a couple of a\nCouple of days around Christmas when uh they don't actually get out there and play it's all fun and good a ton of point being is a ton of college basketball is coming up and I and I feel like being Suzie as ... who is gonna is gonna ... gonna be damp and do a little bit and it's a shame [noise]\nNow I tweeted this out last night at the end you'd feel free to hit me up anytime they these next two and a half hours will will read them as we go along or you can call it nine six Nike T. R. S. [laughter] you know for those of you folks that are listening that are you know true\nDie in the wall was outta tiger football fans\nWhat what what's that moment what is the pivotal moment where you were you just say there's no doubt this program is cursed basketball football anything and everything it's on the table what\nIs that moment because I asked her top five ... ... ... ... and and I and I got a lot of the same\nYou know fully kicker against Nebraska fifth down against Colorado pie said knee Nineteen Ninety five second round of the NC double a tournament against UCLA Norfolk state\nThere's a lot that\nPivotal that one that stands out among the rest some that I didn't hear\nThat I I certainly think deserves some consideration\nDo you remember Ricky Clemens Ethan\nDo not okay so he was the uh the point guard in mid to thousands who got into a little bit of trouble it I'm sort of snowball from their Ricky Clemens basically brought an end to the Coen Snyder\nRegime at Missouri which started the kind of sounds like a D G below ... while she was Ricky Clemens didn't uh didn't that seemed like a great dude and into it it's it's\nIt's just one of those moments where you're you sort of shook her head and said this is this is this is totally the zoo\nAnd it it did not work out all that well how about the about the miss miss feel go against South Carolina back in two thousand in Thirteen at home which quite honestly cost the tigers and opportunity and that has seen it granted they lost Auburn a several weeks later in the SEC championship game\nBut it hadn't been to beat in South Carolina\nWould have gone into that game against Auburn as the leader of the Columbus to get to the national championship game maybe ... or the no question about do you want to feed them the FCC you're all on your in the national championship game no arguments absolutely no arguments\nOn I think about was when the committee picked um Kansas over ... was that\nOh we have the ... was after the o seven single seven yeah yeah I get ... and I heard that too that to me it didn't bother me as as much as I get it there was all a lot of people that were tipped off\nBecause it was a slap in the face to visit will be Kansas you beat Kansas on a neutral field\nYour the better team why is Kansas is going to be cs game and you're having to go play Arkansas in the cotton bowl Darren McFadden by the way was dominated that came out and you remember back then it it was like at ten am too frightened early wake up New Year's day was it was already playing\nWas Arkansas team that had Felix Jones during McFadden Peyton hill a song same team yeah and they ...\nThey did for zoo Missoula role demos that scene because that was when the zoo that was when the zoo was briefly number one in the country\nOr for a week where it was changing every single week and it was that are that Arkansas team had beaten no at the time number one LSU and that was remember that Arkansas team gave the birth\nOf the wildcat quarterback Darren ... running the ... [laughter]\nIt's like [laughter] that'd be remembered I became a thing in the national football league for what the next four to five years or using the wildcat quarterback you know who did this\nOne guy with a Miami Dolphins a white mounted on up out why he's he's dead I get on this one on U.S foreign out stuff that goes to it but I don't it while yeah Tony a\nTony ... nuts Tony ... Tony Soprano yes Tony Tony Soprano has had it passed how I was to penalize has not dead as as far as I Know but that Miami team was utilizing though with the wildcat quarterback and it wasn't a it wasn't it was that guy with\nThe Auburn the running why brown Ronnie Brown brown yeah you're\nAbsolutely right Ricky Williams was there to anything you you know they did they use Ronnie drives the wildcat quarterback and Ricky Williams would always be linked to his right southern sting Tibet he played with a kind of like Williams that all of our to feed [laughter]\nCadillac Williams has to run like a Cadillac so does this give that some ... you know your ultimate your\nPreeminent moves zoo cursed moment\nUm to me I think the the fleet kicker to me is is probably number one\nTo ah to Nebraska because that's what I still vividly remember but there are a lot of candidates there's no question about it but again it's it's it's a downer Jayanti Porter done for the season for the tigers let's continue here on\nFor one gigantic coming out [noise] as we go along blues\nPlay tonight against the Winnipeg Jets\nFinally feel good about uh you know again the only give up a goal Toronto is pretty good for on the board you get a win on the road takes a little pressure off tonight if you if you were to go have a ... trip then facing what seven straight at home\nThe pressure Neal could be a Mets because I I think that's all I'm\nSaying it's going to tell us a whole heck of a lot\nAbout what this hockey club does the rest of the way that this is this is really going to get second very weird for me to say that I I I'm not one to buy into October and November hockey\nTelling us the whole lack of a lot but this to me is going to be critical for a team that's gotten off to sludge or to such a slow start Alex ... said earlier today a courtesy of the blue note productions that\nIt's the first time this team politically game\nWe have played welfare of games are just trial for some reason or another and [noise] there's always the\nFirst time you've played a full sixty minutes and it certainly did show on the ice tonight after he sat out the old healthy scratch ... back in the lineup here's Mike yo\nI mean it's pretty good lectured hourly both come back on the line of obviously that was a that was a real difficult decisions are tough ones when you've got a guy as professional as having that especially with the career that he's hiding you know how difficult that is for him so I'm happy to see if I can wind up and a for profit there's got to do for a while for us\nBut I mean you you just moving forward you can't utilize bomb Easter on the first pairing right you just can't do it\nDon't I don't see how you can't I I was there in a tight spot here with 'em or trees or sounds like we're going to be out for quite a while I mean he's fully formed by St Louis but Mr has been awful\nIt will be out for quite a while I mean he's fully formed by St Louis but Mr has been awful this year I I don't see how he can play more than eight minutes a game well\nYou're in rewrite be with with four to those injury sort of forces the hand of Mike yo and and boom Easter again how prominent role is it a tonight will ah will just have to wait and see but you know quite frankly I liked getting done up there in a higher high profile role we talked about that with the tea last week\nIt was soon ... only going to get better it's tough for him and he's gotten up to a pretty rough start tougher him a tougher to really be\nAll that much worse moving forward to be quite honest with you but what if there is awfully good to give you you know you've got the opportunity to get a pretty critical\nDivision when and like I said that ... when you when to out of there at the way that things started\nThis Canadian trip started to to go back and get another win tonight really sets you up nicely but like I said I I I think this upcoming road trip is going to be significant and\nA a big test no question for the blues moving forward ah let's move along one more hit here on our sports\n\nGame one is set World Series Red Sox then yes it's the Dodgers it would've been fun to see the brute crew I tell you what game seven\nGame sevens are usually pretty electric and there was so much to watch on Saturday Night he was like you're going back and forth get me to get me gave seven oh skinny or to produce Ohio State get me over to\nWell what else was going to give me over yeah give me over to the blues getting if you had so much all happening at once we Christian yellow

[noise]\nEight oh five on the big sports show the five fifty to your friend and we see ... with you\nAll coming up on about a nine hours or so removed from the cardinals farewell press conference to two thousand and Eighteen John Jose like meeting with media earlier today in a very strange setting where it was\nIt wasn't quite a round table but kind of got to all sit around almost like a dinner table and and talk even though I couldn't hear certain things or couldn't do it it just\nHad a strange flow to it compared to the normal press conference setting that we've seen a basically as long as I've been covering the team which is about seven or eight years\nWell they wanted they wanted a winter meetings field\nWhich I get winter meetings if you go cover it it's very informal it's just basically talking ball\nUm there's just the problem is yes many folks who want to know about the cardinals at the end of the season that it was probably a little bit too big of a crowd\nI'm tired folks ... ask them why it wasn't live stream why wasn't broadcast that was the conditions that by the cardinals so ... people are wondering about that that was something that they\nAsked no last year we know tweeting no no obviously all the updates went up afterwards you have your hearing Sam now you're seeing video now\nBut uh they didn't want to broadcast live which I'll actually okay with that because it\nIt's conducive to conversation it leads to a bad interview oftentimes with everybody in there trying to tweet and talk and you know not pay attention to to get the news out I almost prefer an embargo until they leave the room and it's a free for all um because I think it leads to a better\nI'm a better conversation so I'm good with that but ultimately like it was what we wanted we wanted to ask every question from from a to Z and we got a chance to do that what about Carson Kelly what about you\nKnow what about Dexter Fowler ... which positions D.C be insecure do you think you need a starting pitcher what do you do with what about ... tremor I don't\nThink we got to use it every question I don't think we've got ... I don't I don't think there was a question about great Garcia\n\nIs he wasn't that at ... at the top of my [laughter] I'm just saying there's I I don't remember hearing about Greg or maybe a couple other ... other than that yeah every but\nWhat about ... what about Dakota huts water by this\nGuy I mean we basically went through the whole roster and asked for the think I Would have made a lot quicker just does it go down the line just have a roster sitting in front of your address each and every player a down the line but picture stuff you never know where that is conversations are going to go\nLook I I'll be honest when when the question about ... to ask a kind of roll my eyes but I look like a dummy because ... made it sound like there might be something there he says look I understand that Rick series about this\n... a hundred percent committed to it I usually don't comment on free agents but because this guy is basically an employee of mine I Can't comment and says he didn't he didn't talk to him soon so you know I've been to ... idea ... making\nHe didn't talk to him soon so you know I've been to ... idea of ... making a comeback with the cardinals but most not and he has his opinion matters a lot more than mine\nAnd here's the deal it's it's funny because you think of a a need that the cardinals have\nToppled the list is left handed release so up there is any possibility that Rick could get a less the out the cardinals would be a pretty foolish not to ah the kind of see we'll see what see what's there\nI'll say this if I had to bed at my my house on who's going to get this does hit or out in my options are ... our Brett Cecil now getting ill side says I mean he's on the team so I Can't ...\nIt's a story state of affairs but ... you know big picture plans cheer for the off season here's mo\nYou know overall as as we look to this this off season we are ah [noise]\nWe know we have to be engaged we know we have to uh [noise]\nWe'll focus on ways to to truly improve this club or\nWhen you look at that some of the past offseason [laughter]\nDefinitely had some swing and Mrs we've definitely had some\nSuccesses but we've got to find a way to get over that because as I stated to open this we knew eighties we now know it was not good enough that our division doesn't look like it's going to get a week or so I'm going to require both investment and intelligence to give us or that\nAre they going to adapt are they going to try to do the same thing and hope that that other teams fall off and they're kind of persistent said he approached prevails again ... are you going to see some sort of a change and to me the one who sets that tone is the way\nThe other element to follow your been ... on on that front in in\n... depending on how aggressive the cardinals are a lot has been made okay how aggressive would then be with what's happened not\nToo far behind in the rearview mirror would pass family in free agency affect what mole and Mr do it and the cardinals do this off season\nNot really I think that narrative is happened quite a bit where where people\nYou look at some of the investments we've made and now he does that mean we world [noise]\nI don't think that's the way we're doing it um [noise]\nYou know when you when you think back to those moments in time\nNot many people say those are just dumb move\nThey just didn't work out and you don't have we given up on on seesaw in Fowler\nThe answer's no there's there's still time to sort of or some of this out now\nDoes that mean you won't see something dramatic happen between now and February you know putting anything off the table but [noise]\nYou know I think you know if our specific you know there are examples of players that have had\nThe types of careers he's had and then\nA little bit of a downward them back up so\nYou know I really felt like [noise]\nRight before he was injured actually that that night he got injured\nHe was getting to a point\nZero unfortunately\nI think the team itself so as optimism\nObviously a couple of things that take from that uh the team is\nYou know what they're they're ... they're not going to change their approach because of again ... swings and Mrs [noise] what else do you take from that Dexter Fowler still very much in the mix with this ball club well\nI think the feller thing has reached a point where everybody just here's what they want to hear 'em because I was getting feedback from people there going oh my God I Can't believe they committed the foul or that he's going to be back and it's like the way I read that was\nI don't know what they what people want the cardinals to say about Dexter Fowler right now\nHe's got unfolded trait clause is owed fifty million dollars\nNo one wants to trade for him he's not even healthy hasn't been cleared for baseball I write it does the cardinals no good to come out today and say it extra power it's not going to be a part of this anybody wants trade form I mean come on people like wake up like yeah Dexter Fowler could be a part of this team next year\nAlso he could be moved if he does something during spring training that read\nBy idolizes his trade interests when those elect talks about making out the roster for next season and pencil and not pin\nHe's talking about right field being a part of that he's talking about you know we also went on to say that we need to see a lot from extra fellow that's often feel comfortable about banking on him that he ... he goes to spring training and torches everything and he's and he looks great and the cardinals you know aren't interested in trading him because they don't feel like they can get you\nKnow what they could get for they're not they're not completely off texture but I don't I'm not buying that they're just all in on him being the starting right fielder next year either I think they're a spot where they of course want whether they want to keep them or trade him it's still better for them if he if he believes that he's got a spot to play for and he ...\nStill better for them if he if he believes that he's got a spot to play for and he ... and comes back and plays well because even if they are going to move and it makes it easier there's no point today and saying I don't see how this is going to work with our that's the last thing that you won't salaries you are right now so I just don't know like most said it when he said\nWe look at their main allies certainly on a roster at this point that also makes it hard for an upgrade and we know we need to upgrade\nTo me third base in right field or the easiest spots we're not talking pitch and talked to position players it's third base in right field so third base is probably the easiest 'em right field might be the best fit if you're going to go heavy for for one of these star free agents and Harper um but you know to me right field is no way set in stone\nRight now I wasn't really surprised by anything he said because I don't know what else you're supposed to say at this point\nBut you're absolutely right and it's this this is a guy that you've got on your day he's occupying a spot for for better or for worse you have them and I think there's\nIf you're the cardinals you gotta hope he can give you something he's another one of these pieces where ... ... even if you I mean even if he goes out and you know has a you know tears it up in spring training teams aren't\nLooking Jean ... there is no team right now sitting in their front office or you know what we really need in older\nOutfielder that can't really feel this position anymore\nDoesn't really run like a used to and you still got three years old to image somewhat sixty million dollars is a guy we really want or need even if it goes on hits five hundred the first few weeks of spring training the cardinals aren't going to have any takers for this guy\nWell the way that deal works as you go to spring training he proved he's helped these playing well boom somebody loses an outfielder there somebody's hurting for a major league outfielder that's when that deal happen I mean these these things happen um we've seen the cardinals have to do the same thing remember when\nWhen they got ... to ... in that way I mean these people get hurt at spring training that to make trades to fill a spot that's how that\nCould happen again I'm not saying the cardinals are are trying to convince they have to move valor but I'm saying is I don't know that they're convinced they have to start them either I think the right now they're realizing we only really have one card to play here\nAnd it's to be optimistic about Dexter season because there's no other option and that's the one they're playing so to me I wasn't surprised by anything they said I Would have been more surprised if motive came out today and said we got to get rid of the guy frightening to me is like well then you should have just paid him to leave because now you're ... you're not you're not going to get\nYou know anything for him the last thing you want to do is tell everybody in the league but you're you have no interest in having this guy and I I think there is interest I think they hope he comes back in ... they hope he's a part of this he had a good year the year before last year\nI mean so so we're not talking about guys bin ... who's been bad since he came here you had one good year hit one very bad year a very bad year and now there are questions of whether or not he can be healthy to me that was the most interesting thing that was set in the press or is that he hadn't been cleared for baseball activities that's going to be a question about this this is he able to be\nReady yeah here's a here's ... recovery\nShould have a better answer for that early November ah put him in terms of of\nUm he has not been clear for ... I've been to I think that's something that by early November we should have a better gauge of and that too could affect you know how we think about that spot or or how we think about the future it\nJust complicates matters greatly ban is where we can talk until we're blue in the face about harbor harbor harbor but whether we want to admit it or not this this is this is the major stumbling block I Believe to the cardinals bean able having the ability to do are we talking about take that next step\nFather's a a a huge huge part of it and it's just uh I I don't see I don't see any easy out there for this team uh I I think what would be the the shocker of all shocker ... is to see them move on Harper when there's while\nThe extra situation would still be on ... yes I think Ben ... as we heard right there if they're going to get Harper it would be with the extra situation still up in the air because I think we could all assume he's still on this roster come spring training right\nWell yeah I don't see any ways not yeah at this point but I also don't know that\n\nThe presence of that situation keeps you from going after player you'd have identified as who can who can be the cornerstone piece of this team for a long time\nSomething in the car down and never done ... finds a way no you're right you never have too much of it and there's nothing there's nothing that says that ... being overpaid fourth outfielder\nUm look everyone who's ready to anoint Tyler O'Neill come on he struck out forty percent of the time last year and maybe he's the next the next best thing but but but I'm not ready to say I feel comfortable with him being a starting right fielder either to meet ... news the perfect fourth outfielder I don't I'm not ready to say that feel confident with him being the guy at either so\nIt would be it would be really now look if you're going to find a way to go out and get a mega third third baseman and make some other ... like I'm not I think people think that I'm just harbor but they don't get are pretty terrible loss no not at all\nI'm saying that if they but if they stop if they let the Fowler situation stop them from upgrading position\nAnd then it doesn't work\nThen we're talking about the same stuff that we talked about in this press conference today where where they settled\nAnd all of a sudden you know the bottom could drop out in the ... so much of what is now it Fowler is too hard to move and you feel like you your company can bounce back okay I just I then I look after that and then okay what are you gonna do elsewhere because here's the thing is you're\nYou're the most part committed ... called the longest second base Matt carpenter is going to have to play somewhere so it's either a third base or first base you're committed to the most part to pull the young shortstop the audience is not going anywhere Harris invaders committed to in center field\nI Am a veteran must be in the long term homeless has America's veterans face challenges ... there might be with family to support to get back home ... helps veterans of every generation give them benefits they burned I'm a veteran when I got out I thought well you know are we safe\nSo veterans can reach victories great and small\nVictory was fined ... ... we are joined um human again\nAboard more victories for veterans go to ... or\nBack to the big sport show on on like five fifty Katie R. S. [noise]\nDo you have any idea you'd have biggie bringing into a segment tonight Ben\nI'm all about it I'm far does march all one of my favorite movies yeah\nA lot of big in that one hardball or Moneyball\nHardball does in the heck yeah all the time or gee maybe R. I. P. baby\nLouise going to watch that one I think it's only ... issue no hair you up on that you're a jerk or now they\nCan't come in my opinion Reeves best performance of his career forget the matrix it's replacements and hard ball\nWhat about bill and Ted's excellent adventure that you're at that come on now that's that's old school that's like a U.S that's uh something new and gardener\n[laughter]\nGuilty as charged I'm All right let's let's circle\nBack here to old Marcel ozone and we mentioned at the uh the shoulder injury it's still an issue how big of an issue was it for oh sooner this year here's mo\nShoulder issue comes up a lot when we were we talk but I still don't know the answer how much a truly effective because when you ask them so it's not really but\nI Do think like when we acquired ozone and we knew we were getting off a career right I mean so\nWas I going to be some level of regression to the mean I think the answer is probably\nNow when you look at him entering a this next year you're hoping maybe you might see a balance towards\nThe other way but I think you know he didn't affective player\nHe he he is\nA very very good hitter\nUm I think defensively he did create a level of a liability for us because of his inability to throw\nYou know I think it's really incumbent upon him\nTo spend this off season being diligent about\nPutting his shoulder in a position where they can be strengthened\nYou know we can we can show you where the water is but we can't make a drink and I think in his case he's going to have to take that very seriously\nPlaces to do that whether it's in the DR Miami Jupiter wherever he'd like to do it but eventually he has to show off\nIts funny ... because we we do something we really weren't aware of until the kind of get this spring training what what's wrong with his shoulder and you know here we are some seven months later\nAnd it's still a mystery is this is this is wild well\nIt's I don't know that it's as big of a mystery of the cardinals made it out to be during the\nSeason I think I think now they're being very candid about it and I think part of that comes from them getting tired of being blamed for for it all see yeah I'm basically\nMost said today what had been hinted at\nThroughout the season that the cardinals identified an issue here saw was causing problems try to you know back him off at spring training to deal with it it didn't get better went to them as it was getting worse and said hey let's let's try to do something here and and those who knows spent the whole season basically brushing everyone away\nTelling people I'm fine I'll play through it ended up a couple of spikes\nIn performance that I guess you know encouraged enough folks that they let him kind of dictate what he needed it wasn't until the team won out west\nTo California and really I think you know cardinals fans like to beat up Scott Boris but Boris helped the team this year by getting to a unit and saying look man sometimes outright with you here's video house screwed up your swing is\nLet's get this checked out and for whatever reason that clicked any day and and got the shot and we saw what he did after that now\nTo me the question is what happens now because by that point his season was already pretty marred by this um you know and really to me the shoulder I don't know how much you can see the show I don't know how to what extent the shoulder wasn't a huge factor in this because he was heading\nHe just wasn't hitting with power he wasn't getting balls off the ground to the contact was there the exit velocity was there all the things that you look for in a guy who's who's losing power he had um he had the right stuff the ball just wasn't leaving his bat the same the swing wasn't\nThe same and that to me he's clearly because of the shoulder I don't I'm not in his body I don't know what he feels and I think most making that point like\nYou don't have a guy who's telling you what do you feel that we don't have a guy who's raising up his own flag and then when you go to him and say this doesn't look right he's he's not embracing the the feedback or doesn't want to see the treatment and there's only so much\nYou can do know contrary to popular belief you can't strap these guys down on treatment tables and go to work on behalf of it has to be a two way street I think the cardinals felt like that a road blocks for a lot of the season now the spin a forward and it's what do they do to get this guy right\nAnd there's a few factors in play here\nPart of this big picture the cardinals mode talked a lot today about doing things with all the players this off season they usually give them some things to work on in the off season now that it's going to be they can't make it mandatory as much as they would like to you but there's going to be some accountability here on what they are expected to do between now and the start of spring training\nYou got the here it is kind of laid it out maybe goals for for each and every player here's mo\nWeek we sort of understand all these little\nThings each individual may need to address whether it's from the baseball side whether it's from the medical side whether it's from the mental side whatever those are\nOur goal is by November one to be able to present every player [noise]\nA a list of of areas that they need to focus on so called middle of February it's not like hey did you do that\nThe the accountability of this off season is is going to be very real\nAnd our expectation\nThe of this off season is is going to be very real\nAnd our expectations are are going to be very clear\nAnd so when you were asking about someone specifically like Cold War\nHis leg issues will be addressed this off season now again we can\nSuggest or tell you to do whatever we think you need to do but you have to have buy in\nAnd and you have to feel it's going to help you\nWhen we present and position is our our our hope for for the game is that [noise]\nMiddle of February we can hit the ground running and not have that moment of we gotta catch off\nI'm an example that a lot of ways is is like as if when you think about last year we had a limit throws in spring training we had to really sort of limit outfield drills because we didn't want to stay\nPut him in a worse fought him and be just over expose them to to somewhere where he's going to take a major step backward so if we can handle that between now and February that I think you are level of success will be higher than that\n[noise] so what do you make out of that I think it's the story of the day\nUm because it's a shift in approach the cardinals are now saying we're going to try to maximize and all season to the point that it's not guy show up at spring training we find out oh something's wrong we spent the off season taking what's wrong and trying to fix it so we hit the ground running\nWhen we get there and and it's going to open up a\nWorld of possibilities now they're going to they're going to have to get by in and it's going to be really fascinating and I wonder too as more and more team start to do this kind of stuff if I'm\nAt the players union doesn't start barking a little bit yeah because the colonel's can't make things mandatory yet they you know playing time first opportunity like all these things factor into this some guys don't aren't going to have anything\nUm you know some guys are told hey you're good some got just a hey this was a problem last year let's set up some things for you to work on and that's always been the case but now there's going to be accountability that was going to be a ... with us or hey let's come come check in and make it let's make sure you've done this um so that's going to be a fascinating\nConversation as to how players respond\nUm I think I think you could see some discussion about this being a new trend among teams I'm you know it's going to be not just baseball performance either it's not just going to be hey work on your pick off news it's not just going to it could be hey you need to get with a you know you need to get with a\nMental coach on some stuff here ... Fowler talked about he thinks the biggest reason for his struggles a season was mental health um you know there are ways of players can can work on strengthening that aspect of the game it's a huge part of the game then nobody talks about for those Luna with Carlos Martinez is going to be physical therapy or they get their bodies in shape how they get right\nMost talked about being glad that Carlos was going to stay in St Louis his off season because they could have a closer monitor over his treatment over his recovery and to me it's like almost disappointing you're listening that as a positive because this guy to the point that career where\nIf he's not in St Louis he's not going to be doing the right things to to get to get right to be the starter next season I mean it's it's almost like you're pulling your hair out at this point but it does seem like they have identified this as a weakness our guys are showing up not fully ready to roll and we're going to fix that now\nI'm now he would say don't look at it as a weakness look at it as a what could be a strength but there's a reason they're paying attention to it they've identified as something they want to get better at it and that's usually because they're not good at it enough\nAre scheduled to sit out and be eligible next season but there are a lot of these transfers that are getting waivers and uh and finding their eligibility immediately and cons on Martin\nDid tell the folks today in fact been told us last I Can't remember been told us on the air and not have been told us he had been in contact with kinds of trying to get some insight on a on finding that waiver well indeed ... has and they're going to try to get the Smith\nOn a on finding that waiver well indeed ... has and they're going to try to get the Smith Brothers again not brothers but they're going to try to get the Smiths eligible immediately and and even\nThat would change was use fortunes it would be a complete one eighty because I I the concern right now for the tigers backward and your ability to score and the ... and your ability to play make in the back court maybe\nJohn the reporter can go out there and an average of double double every night but it might not be enough\nDon't you think that's why he's not first team policy see 'cause if\nHe was he would probably been a top a first round pick last year by most yes some up by most people's projections or a second round pick early second ... so you would think he'd be a first first team player if if everything around the team was solid which I don't think the point guards are\nRight oh and like I said that the guys that made first team are also really good and and I said silver South Carolina there picked eleven gathered for Arkansas either pick tense so it's not it's not as if those guys got the nod because they're going to play on really good teams that got the not because they're really good players John ... I'm I'm not sure\nWhat his numbers will look like here's the thing\nHere would be my dream line for John ... at the end of the year if he plays every game let's call Thirteen points per game let's go nine rebounds per game and let's do it well let's keep going for us is\nLet's go two blocks let's go one steel\nHeat is your prototypical stat sheet stuffer but I don't see him as somebody that night in night out going to lead this team in scoring and I think that's always what we kind of folk ... focus on at first and we need to focus on it for this team because there isn't that instant\nGuy who stands out who's going to be the focal point\nOf this office I just I think if if he could average like say six ... six us as a game that would be interesting yeah I'd take six that means he's passing of all people are open and they're making their shots which like last year wasn't always the case with people making shots outside of cash Robertson and Barnett\nAnd I see him being like high fit like really high efficiency sixty percent feel go percentage\nHopefully improved and he was pretty good at the free throw line last year anyway but you know he can shoot it obviously from beyond the are key should teach checks off every single box and that's why John ...\nIs going to be highly sought after in the NBA or is it was really curious about this year in in watching college troops are teams and ... sort of one of these teams will Tillman too and and and not so much with John tape because he's a\nHe's got every other aspect of his game going except maybe he doesn't have the handle\nBut that's all these\nPosition let's basketball it is it's the talk of of of the troops to go along with the trial and the FBI or let's say each and all and all of that and it's just basketball in general these teams that stockpile\nPrototypical begs the six nine six ten guys you can eat always say you have to have some sort of size two in college basketball and win basketball at any level and that's obviously still true but if you're only stockpiling guys\nThat all they can do is rebound and ... and and if those [laughter] I just wonder\nWhat happens with those guys with we heard remember Tyler Davis Texas seeing him their big center last year seven feet tall left early didn't get drafted didn't get ... I think he had been feet\nTall I think he has I think he had some off the field trouble though 'cause I ... I Believe he signed with the Celtics and he didn't report or something like that something very strange\nYou know you're right but that easy and he's just one example though there's a litany of guys that left early last year that I use prototypical big that don't\nTranslate to today's NBA the question is for me do they still translate to today's college basketball and for the teams that go position was slew is going to be a very interesting case the thing with flu is they've just got athletic freaks and ...\nAnd early on it but it's ... I don't think anybody's confused medium for your prototypical big key is just a freak athlete what\nWe've talked a lot about that strengthens loose front court how well how much does that really matter in today's game if you play it you know play teams that are going a one in four out it\n... the landscape has changed and I want to see how much it's changed I'm not ready to go all in on this yet but I'm very curious to see how this goes this year but for a guy like giant they he doesn't really fit really any mould because he does all these things well but he's not\nA perimeter guy he's not a handle guys not somebody who's going to bring up the ball I don't think he is yet get his body sculpting I think it's getting that way and let's see what type of player he looks like bought used but getting to your original point what happens if the Smiths play\nSuddenly I think this team could do a lot and then there's less pressure on your ah in Torrance Watson\nAnd uh you know the kid from Chicago pinched in to to be the guys in the ... or get a look at it right now look at your back court those are the guys are going to be leaning on for production and then you're obviously I'm leaning on\nYou know everybody's everybody's favorite a whipping boy there at that point\nAnd it's it it it would she would solve a lot of issues but I don't think anybody can hope for that I don't I don't think that's something that we can call the probability you think Jordan guy starts to sure yeah I think he's your starting point guard and now it is pinch in a just completely\nUh blows away a guy's tearing in the pre season but as bad as pointed out I I've seen it I I ... loves guys he loves joined guy so it would be hard to see him completely phased out but boy he's got to be better than than last year\nIt's hard it's hard to put a lot of pressure on two freshman but I think ... and I'm ... ... to me they're going to be the deciding factor of this team\nQuestion about it I I think Watson if I were if if the Smiths or ineligible let's assume they're not I I think we got we have to be as a long shot right now if they're not eligible\nMy pick would be ... soon as you're leading scorer if John ... is your leading scorer almost wonder if some of his other stats or suffer a little bit and that that would just that would be interesting there and\nI get he's so good to get his game is is so well balanced Watson to me if he's\nIf he's right quick he averaged Fifteen again that's ... that's asking a whole heck of a lot you just don't know but to me he would make the most sense to be your to beer leading score and again Tillman ... does he stay out of ... trouble and in can he be double digit game\nStore with with six or seven rebounds in the defense of go along there's well again and I think most importantly Kim Tillman average north of twenty minutes a game\nThat's the thing candy stay out of style job will stay on the floor he could be a again he is you're more prototypical big but there's a lot of skill they're obviously with a Jeremiah till ...\nBut there's a lot of skill they're obviously with a jury might do that again the zoo number nine in the pre season pool why Britain we usually it's the big sport showing the big five fifty\nK.

I don't believe he ever signed a big contract with trauma unless I'm forgetting but I think he\nWas a very clubs ... it was a long term ... but it was very club friendly\nYeah I don't to me he didn't fully grasp the value that he has in his prime and look at him now he's he's not even by almost a third of the player he used to be or how the ...\nThere are a lot of guys that are going to fall into that category and then you write Donaldson is a is a perfect example of that I'm Still coming up here the rest of the show Rob range is going to join us next in line and we'll talk more about uh\nAbout Rob's take from from what he heard yesterday and he's got some great thoughts on again this coaching staff it is\nA it is in flux right now Jose oh can do a heading back to Florida and he is certainly his presence will be missed on this ball club and we'll talk to them as do football with our good friend Chris Serino we haven't had a chance to catch up with Chris so far this season will do that\nYou know we haven't had a chance to catch up with Chris so far this season will do that\nLater on in the hour as well you had to dismiss Fifteen\nI'm actually starting to get more and more competent zoos gonna win this gene and maybe winning going away on Saturday but there are still a lot of elements it's going to make the skiing during tricky we'll talk about that coming up as well it's a big sports show Britain we see on the big five fifty T.

are heading out west to Boise to do it it'd be Jay and cheering and and the family out there are certainly a send our best wishes is are you guys getting ready for a for a nice week out there\nWas really follow is always good to see the kids were so you're closer but always when we get together\nNo question about it I'm Rob we we got to kind of finally closes the book on the twenty teens seizing yesterday for the cardinals in general they liked visited with a with us for\nFor about an hour I guess before we get to some of the takeaways themselves in general comments I guess the big news is that who's that we can do is is heading back to Florida oh what what do you think there are some of the ramifications of this move\nWhy were you know two of them already it was a war or how third minute by minute of the bench coach so those I think a law well deserved more has a long history of managing the minor leagues and\nWhen you're a minority parents are almost all cases you're also coach you are very so not a new position for him by any chance of having spent the last part of of both remember he fell down\nOn the staff after a crystal Oreos was fired and they moved to a couple of years ago they are they moved my show to prove that role you know who have a third base coach hero so powerful than that and I feel that also of course the second half of this is a\nLittle familiar with the big leagues I think for him but I was seeing those characters cautious her so I think that's that's a good move and then all the way that none of my shows no showed it for years of my show was actually the scout this draft assigned\nTo the organization what he was kept coming out of college you know several years ago so\nThey've had a long history together after work well together so both of those I think are are positive most obviously oh can do is there's a loss to the to the artist shows as supposed to talk about but not big at the level that you know it's nice to have his pulse of what's going on I mean there's all this you know he has\nFailed out of here as always has feels a lot of people on this club is going to be talking on a regular basis of watching the games are so many and put that the same time now will be able to help some of the online earlier so not not as if he's worried organizations just they don't transfer to another role not really a surprise\n[laughter] and Rob you've got a piece up on that are on the sports page right now I'm Talking about these coach he moves around the defense obviously still wasn't falling\nGreat last year ... is there a chance we overrated Jose's effect on on on one he can and what he can still do to help the defense\nOut that's his work with guys go repetitious and stuff like that it can help with my position I\nKind of how to play different hours I think he was a big airport on all the young and I were kind of position himself took advantage of his strengths and his ranger their lack of raise this other areas they're going to have a great coach feels like you're ... you're told me one time last year we were talking about there and watch all cultures and\nYou know who to coach the coaches and as a war they said was the coach they literally blazed standing in the bath ... feet when he was reading other charities they looked at a third base coach gets that guy's a look at me I Can't help it out\nYou know if it's the same thing you know what's out there to fill out a lot out there with it you know it's got to make the points out so it's a it's still up to the players the oil fields but to actually too closely to something like that and so I\nThink that's all their priority but you know at what cost of a oh we've also you know realize that there's still\nSome officers shortcomings or this or add up to that you're gonna have to address so it's it's always a\nSexual ... you know which way that we kind of approach um it's it was interesting to see what they do\nAnd we're we're still a little ways away you know were removed from this move coming down but when the cardinals named she'll manager when they didn't Rob where were you on board with the timing in and do you think that some move [laughter] still looks pretty sound right now is we're going to get a few extra moved from the season\nNever know what's gonna happen Scott always talked to people always go to the grocery [laughter]\nVery interesting is knows we talked about yesterday with their ... their way out a couple of things to see if they all started clapped does good you know in the mix for somebody who's basically measure openings or else they'll be all the coaching staff here and if if he does get a job somewhere else and that opens up a couple of jobs we'd all the ... job is going to be open obviously because of that\nIraq is definitely in the next for the job ... job which is open with their maps\nSo if that happens that are looking for a new director ... ... it could be a lot of lot of moving parts your a story forward they're always going to keep our ah our nose to the ground and see what we find out no question\nAbout Rob thanks so much as always safe travels out west look forward

hoop season believe it or not it's the one and only Christian you know Chris thanks as always for the time sir how are you\nWell Brennan thank you I mean\nIt's always a pleasure and Chris I no tigers fans or or maybe maybe ... to be getting out of this gauntlet of of a number two in the country Georgia on the road South Carolina and then on the road number one\nAlabama I Know I Know we're all disappointed that means you couldn't come away with a winning that stretch Chris what what do you see during this runs for the tigers and again we knew would be there to stretch of the season\nRight stretch of the sky anyone's\nAdmission certainly would have told you that one we scams whenever the sky but really the most disappointing was one of the middle right off the Carolina and and you know for a couple of reasons obviously as you mentioned George or a number to\nAlabama still number one another's really figured it'd be difficult and you know South Carolina before the season I thought that will be a hard game from Missouri to win and\nYou know things unfolded during the ... are they still be a challenge to get it done there but when you\nRealize that I had a quarterback albeit a senior making his first start factor game Cox did not look as good as I think many of us thought they'd be that was one Missouri really let get away and certainly in the game let get away when they had such a big lead and just made so many mistakes and [noise]\nI guess when I take away as was just had a couple of really difficult quarter is the\nThird quarter against South Carolina when they were out scored Seventeen nothing on the second quarter in Alabama when they're out scored Seventeen nothing you can afford to do that to give up such a point\nBut scored Seventeen nothing so [noise] you know you\nCan't afford to do that to give up such a run of points against a worthy opponent and I know coach on him was preached a lot about other much more competitive than they were last year in games against a\nGeorgian Caroline and he was he is right I just know that they've got to get back to the wing town really starting to Saturday with Memphis or else things are going to get interesting maybe doing interesting down the stretch that they've lost all your three in a row there's not a whole lot of margin for error against uh [noise] you know some teams that they should be able to handle not to Memphis is\nA terrible by any means I have done very well but Missouri has nearly a double digit favorite at home I'm home going needs to win that game\nYeah no question about it you know it's funny we looked at this October stretch who used to be difficult but I think we almost had this vision of okay later on year the schedule lighten up a little bit and certainly compared to plead George in Alabama would but now after watching some teams and\nAnd even then you know even the Arkansas game and then in in you obviously need to read all these improved the season's going on they've been able to score some points Tennessee\nHe just wanted Auburn obviously Florida has scored a couple of big wins already deems that we might be more manageable manageable for nuclear suddenly looks a lot more daunting and it's tough to really pinpoint a game you say oh they absolutely are when there aren't any of those in the winds are there right now\nNo there really aren't and and they really begins of Memphis too I thought oh alone would be a challenging game 'cause they've been a good team certainly American Conference and I just thought it was a dangerous game because you naturally\nWould exhale after the stretch of Georgia South Carolina Alabama you come home and non conference game it's oncoming only they have better be ready in Missouri and sharp because Memphis there's a great running back barrel Henderson leaving the country and rushing in\nMemphis is you know Brandon nearly knocked off central Florida which would have been that schools first laws and a couple years they let in most of the day Memphis and lost by one point in the end so tough and then he got Kentucky you know\nFive and a one should be banned due to go six in ... Florida who's already six and won and Vanderbilt always plays a defensive team and [noise] you know you mentioned the other is kind of see awful when at Auburn\nArkansas really scoring ... points even though it's losing some game so I certainly think there are more wins out their forms or I definitely believe that was you know six games down and six to go but clearly the second half of a schedule I think right now is when you visit a look for more daunting than originally I Would have certainly before the season early in the season\nNo question about of Christian with us here in the big the\nCPR

struggle mentioned it last week some struggles running the or another new off for him this year under daring dueling\nWas a transition time but\nYou know I Know cruise not one to want to make excuses and I'll be honest and I think he would admit this to me he's got to play better you know from Missouri to win games especially close games as we think a lot of them could be here in the final half of the season he really has got to be\nBetter and you've got to have your best players play well [noise] I think he's been a little bit again you look at the competition you have to take that into account I Do think the manual absence is significant I really do believe that he certainly had been the tigers big\nDeep his numbers are still pretty well among the receivers if you look at it and of course he went out and play three games now so I Do think they had something good going there the young guys a freshmen have stepped up a bit especially\nIn the Knox but that is a big loss or you know maybe bigger than I even realized a few weeks ago when I first started missing some time assault [noise] a lot goes into it but but drew needs to and I think a man and and probably will play better

at ... the guy to type reports that the British Open that we don't see maybe as much as the euro's do and that's the guy from ... brand battle oh I'm so those are my top five that have yet to win

even go higher in the world looked golf and\nHe has all the tools necessary to win a major championship I think he's going to get the job done I'm not jumping off the future bandwagon quite yet\nUh

mention his name but you you mentioned it to a I think a ... you know he is you know for quip men are his arsenal to uh to get the job done\nAnd the guy the guy that neither one of us mentioned just

joining us rather timely because news just reached the grill room about the retirement of Johnny Miller first I Want your thoughts on John his career and\nJohnny Miller first don't want your thoughts on Johnny's career and then and now that he's hanging him up what are you thinking\nPlot you know one thing is is he changed the landscape in um announcers and helicopters approached golf he never backed down he always had an opinion you may not have always agreed with his opinion\nBut he had an opinion and that was so contrary watch to anybody else I mean prior to that the only time I remember anybody saying anything negative was was actually just a Jack Nicklaus was in the booth when John ... was in the playoffs at the old course at St Andrew's for the open championship and\nDecided to hit driver at Seventeen and Jack was questioning the move and you hit it left into the into the rock but anyways daily eventually one and that was almost like\nA herd of that a player in the booth would question\nSomething that a player on the ground would be doing so it wasn't often that you would see that like Johnny noticed basically spent a career doing that and uh I think that's added or lead to what other people to dial in television that actually probably forced ... out of the booth\nAt CBS because he was unwilling to be critical of the players on the ground because he was out like that was not what he should be doing and so I think ... did a great job and I think it really made a difference for NBC who was\nLet's be honest bothering me to go back to the old days but I wouldn't say NBC was necessarily the or the behemoth in covering golf I think it was really CBS I think with Johnny Miller they made a separation that they hadn't made before\nAnd I've seen a lot to do with the fact that the listeners\nA very comfortable uh Gary coke or Roger ... be a Dan Hicks I mean when you turn on your TV Saturday Sunday you are hearing familiar voices that you really I'd gotten the trust over the years so it made their appeal even greater\nRight I think that you know one of the things that if you were in a team sport one of the things that you look at\nIs that that player makes the other players better and I think in Chinese Casey made as you said the other players that are larger mouthpiece that Gary Cokes a all the people that came on board I mean I was obviously\nI have a relationship going way back when with golf dot com where you know we went out of the relationship with NBC Sports I'd be in those meetings with people like Johnny and Roger and actually even Dave Marr\nAnd um you know it was it was it was fascinating on how they approach things out there but the central comedy writers the executive producer has been there or the producer now I should say who's been there forever and so he's been there with\nJohn Miller through most of it and I I just think that they were better product because of Johnny Miller and and if it's all is true which you know I've seen many different reports\nThat Paul Asian or it's going to take over for Johnny ... which I I find a little hard to believe because I Can't believe Paul wants to be on the road that much but if he is he's going to be a great addition to\nA a good team but as Jon Miller leaves you're going to start seeing that team split up you're going to see Roger malt the not get it and do another contract I'm almost positive that you're going to see Gary coke on his last contract so you start seeing\nThese guys Peter Jacobson you're going to start seeing these guys move away and so it's going to be a new it's got to be a new team I'm within the next five years I Would think\nOh I'm doing here it is just the front runner from all the reports that\nWe have heard although it was just a couple of months ago that the idea of that David Duvall a was being groomed to take over for John Miller and he's inside scoop on um what happened with that or or were those rumors are premature\nShe made when he went on a week ago after being whistled for the targeting totally ... did you guys have a message for him\nFor interest to them no word on a on a I'm going to go in and do what we came here to do was\nOnly ... the guy that you've known for a long long time he's running back in Memphis ... foot high school together Melrose closer to you and what makes him such a great front of your\nLife\nWhat
