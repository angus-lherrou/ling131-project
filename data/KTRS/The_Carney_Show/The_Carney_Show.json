I'm a big group of people they all sooner I Want to ask you questions ... Kelvin zero also to help answer the question is well it's\nA nice to be All right the website is when retirement happens great resources and you have got a checklist and this is what I Want to talk about you have a retirement checklist I Do sue sue there's about\nThirty questions on it um it could be more ... you know we could again make fifty on there who want to but we kind of boils down\nTo the whole purpose of this is really to get people to start thinking about what should I be doing for retirement so it doesn't matter if you're gonna retire and five years\nOr you're already retired you should have had these questions answered long\nAlready retired you should have had these questions answered long before you took your money out of your account okay so this checklist we can find on the website you can find it on my website when retirement happens\nDot com and just go to the education to Abbott says retirement plan checklist somewhere on that list and all you gotta do is basically I think it says get PDF or download you put your name\nYour phone number in it and it gives it to you and your downloaded immediately for some reason it doesn't work for ya\nWhich it does but for some reason it does you can always email me\nAt a cabin at when retirement happens dot com so Kevin at when retirement happens dot com and you're saying that these dirty questions you all you have to answer yes to all thirty of these questions before you're ready to retire you have to answer yes to every single one of these questions and if your answer no\nYour advisors probably not talking to you about these things and this is kind of just a checklist to help you get to that point right I mean if you if you're thinking about retirement you probably need it if you're in retirement he's still probably needed right because what if we're not getting the information\nThat and we're supposed to get it was the joke we had in last week's show how do you get to the store first get to the store and then we'll tell you how to get there right now right fire okay first retire and then we'll help you know you need somebody to help you or is that right because people actually do come into my office and and I asked him some of these questions and they say\nI saw them and hardworking people had a little more money to cover their basic needs it also meant they had more money just man in businesses just like mine\nHundreds of business owners across Missouri agreed\nRaising the minimum wage means more customers for small businesses which also leads to more hiring

because retirement is going to happen are you going to be ready the website when retirement happens ... great resource for some great information including his retirement check list that we're talking about uh do you have another one they're forced\nTo number nine basically says my retirement plan is based on net number so I can easily adjust for changes in the tax code [noise] so what does that really mean that made it even goes\nHere's my budget my living expenses okay here's everything I Need to do to do things I Want to do in retirement and I go on vacation and pay for the house for the cars electric bill whatever okay\nThose are the that's the amount of money that I Want to spend every single month in retirement that want to spend so it's my next\nWant to spend every single month and retirement that I Want to spend ... so it's my net after tax money\nSo when people come into my office I ask them you know do you know how much you need on a monthly basis okay now I don't just go by that number because everybody is usually wrong right okay because we you know a lot of people just don't know how much money they really need whatever number I gave you a guarantee you it's wrong so they tell you\nI Need I Need Seventy thousand dollars I said OK Seventy thousand dollars\nIs that is at Seventy thousand gross or net sometimes have to explain between that and grow so gross before tax and that is after ... and they said you know while making Seventy now right so I think I Need Seventy I said okay well that makes sense well how much you're putting in your for one can't but in ten thousand and okay so\nYou make Seventy but you're putting intensity really getting sixty right yup OK singing remember those taxes Social Security Medicare tax so you've got that you can knock that off there also and he got federal tax and got state tax and you got your family plan for health insurance so so so really your check is\nLike three thousand dollars a month or two thousand dollars a month and then they say oh yeah I guess I guess the only need that and that\nBut in reality what I really want to do is I Want to go through a budget line by line haven't you feel this out why do I do that\nIt's an exercise for me to really understand that you know what your real budget really looks like right because I never really seen people do exactly what their budget looks like except for a few engineers that have come into my office would there be beautiful spreadsheet right now\nAnd I love to go through those as well too but I like to see things Lynette invalid because see things inflate differently as well to going back to the first question\nIf I have a thirty year mortgage right in my house payment and we'll just say it's a principal and the interest payment not escrow ... is a thousand dollars a month I Know that thousand dollars a month will never ever get higher\nWhy because my payments of thirty year fixed payment and then my house is paid off civil never changed now we do know that more goes to the interest in the beginning and more goes to the principal at the end but that thousand bucks is still a thousand bucks for Thirty years why were they inflate to right All right so that makes sense not to do that\nBut what about health care premiums\nWhat about long term care costs that maybe those have to be inflated six to eight percent so we want to make sure assigning the appropriate inflation value not just a flat four percent on everything\nWell you also do everything you do how much you spend on dry cleaning how much you spend on going out how much you spend on TV of\nNetflix the a ... to to the Fox theater to your car no games do you go to blues games tell me what does it look like to see if I Can't help you paint your picture to me there's no way I can put together a financial plan I have to know everything\nAnd some people like the old things close to their vest were really good at what we do but we are for where reading mind we just need some help doing that so you always want to plan from after attacks perspective\nNow what else can we do to try to fix that situation which comes onto a another question unless you were you know say something\nI Will say that it's it's like um if you write down everything you spend in a week\nRight and you're like oh my goodness I Can't believe I spent money on that and that and this and this right or\nYou're you're trying to lose weight so you write down everything you eat at the end of the week like I Can't believe I had for Snickers bars right now I only did I thought I didn't even like Snickers bars at the same thing with ... with this plan right down all the money you spend it you know and how you spend it and what you think you spend in what you spend are two different things\nThey are in my Achilles heel is ... or bass pro\nWhen I go in there I rarely go in there and just by one thing usually I get a lot of stuff and my basket and then you know there are some times that I Do go into a store and they come up with nothing but don't you feel kind of guilty coming out with nothing that's like ... seriously I didn't steal anything I'm just to me because I find that I didn't watch here [laughter]\nBut but yes we have to know these things for my wife is target some people could be Wal Mart or what have you know you can't leave all more with one thing you know you're right everything's cheaper Walmart you're right you're right All right ah what's the next one so this I think is very important people don't understand how this works so we try to teach it in our workshops\nMy retirement plan takes in consideration that the possibility Social Security can be taken tax free even with spend all income of more than fifty thousand or so the worst enemy hefty thousand it could be a hot or it could be more than that\nIn English would that really means is is that what I hear is a lot of people say if you make more than thirty two thousand as a married couple you will pay tax on your Social Security folks if you've heard that your advisor doesn't know what he's talking about your tax person doesn't know what they're talking about right\nIt's a calculation the IRS does to determine their Social Security is taxable\nIf you're a in a park you know you could write it down it's half of Social Security puzzle taxable income plus any interest on tax free and trust\nThat together if it's under thirty two thousand your Social Security is not taxable if its wing thirty to forty for up to fifty percent of it can be taxable anything over forty for up to eighty five percent can be taxable\nBut just because they can be taxable does that mean that is is accessible because I have clients what's been double income north of a north of a hundred thousand and they're still not paying tax on Social Security\nSay that again you have people who were made eighty Ninety a hundred thousand dollars who do not pay taxes on\nSocial Security right so those individuals that keeps saying that if you make more than thirty two thousand dollars you pay taxes the wrong they just don't know what they're talking about\nI can walk you through the numbers are could walk them through the numbers but I'm not going to do that but I'll walk you show you\nHow all of this works folks I found that if I can show you how to not pay tax on Social Security or pay the least amount of money in tax on Social Security your money last a lot longer right\nAnd so we want to make sure that we maximize every opportunity and one to keep my money from the government I think is very very important it's not our patriotic duty to increase our taxes to increase it I\nAnd he said well you drawing Social Security now because yeah I'm sixty eight and I started my own benefit is sixty six but I was planning on waiting to Seventy but they made me so mad\nDown there that she worked this long and I'm not going to get any of her benefits I said forget it I'm just going to find as soon as I get the full retirement age and also work right\nHe goes I Wish somebody would have told me back then I like that and I could have done this and he said well what about your financial advisors and no one told them anything in fact he didn't really have a financial advisor\nBut the thing is is he could have been drawing that check even let's say it was twelve hundred bucks a month from sixty six to Seventy but is it is like\nFifty grand almost so he could have been drawing his wife's widow check in and delaying his own the U.S getting getting money now and delaying his money so we get more later example let's say his check was two thousand and sixty six guaranteed it would have been two thousand six hundred and forty dollars\nBut we've had cost of living adjustment so it would have been actually higher than last year was two point eight percent\nAnd if he was delaying his benefit you get eight percent per year after full retirement plus the cost of living so this person that are this year any by delaying their benefit gets ten point eight percent increase in their Social Security check\nWhat money do you have right now that is going to be guaranteed ten point and it was back it up and say there was no cost of living what's going to guarantee you eight percent right if you had two accounts one paying five percent in one paying eight percent and you need to get to some money which one would you take it from first assuming they have the same tax qualify take the five percent\nYeah you should write right because you want to present to grow yes well every day people take that eight percent and they and they don't realize it\nSee a good strategy when it comes to Social Security ... percent opportunity they do right\nThree categories individual benefits spousal benefits and survivor benefits and I look at it that way by us about your whole family right\nAnd the options are different when you're divorced in their options are different when you have someone that has died that you're married to you want to make sure you don't mess up when it comes to this because there's so many options that are available to you throw out the old rules in the new rules just forget it all forget what's your advice of told you there's options for you\nThat it actually just forget everything you just call Kevin because he will figure it out for you that's the more I Do the show the more that's just should be the whole show called given\nThat just with an M A show called Kevin Kevin instead of coal salary [laughter] better call better call Kevin three one for six for one tent and or the website when retirement happens this a checklist we got time for another one in the segment give us an\nOn air we do our eyes so again my retirement plan considers taxes in such a way I Will know which account to spin from first which one to spend from second third fourth so on I Will know how to keep my taxes as low as possible I've\nBeen to the ... I have learned this I've seen you chalk this out and game play this out this is sort of to me this is the holy grail because nobody knows which account to take the money from causes certain other things to happen\nRight so how when when you take your money out of different types of a cowboy actually pick your taxes so there's only three accounts didn't matter how rich you are how much money you save you can only put money into three spots three categories taxable tax deferred or tax free\nNo other places so that I\nSaw a taxable a cow it'd be like a U.S an after tax investment in a CD or stock or a mutual fund or something like that that if it gets interest or dip it in you will get that ten Ninety nine or the interest income showing up on your tax return ... would be something like a four O. one K. and higher alright\nBut tax deferred typically you're differing the taxes to some later point and a lot of those accounts you have to take money out at Seventy and a half right right [noise]\nThe third accounts tax free now some people when I ask them if they would tell me a map of attacks Rick how some people say immunity by Judy bonds tax rate right there right and they can be a writer you would have a Missouri bond you live in Missouri Missouri interest it's tax free\nThe federal inches this tax free sometimes you have triple except for like Puerto Rico or something like that\nBut I don't know if they could you want one of those bombs [laughter] everybody hold any ways they can be taxable though why would they be tax will solidify paid ten grand for that bond and it kind of came up in value eleven now I have a capital gain if I sell it [noise] okay so you can pay capital gains tax\nSecond thing is is municipal bonds cause tax are can cause tax on Social Security ah so there's still tax that can be a part of it\nNow we know Roth IRAs grow tax for your poll without tax free rein in some included will in the provisional calculations determined to Social Security tax or not so Halloween when when you pull money out of these different types of counts will dictate the amount of tax sometimes I see people say Kevin\nI Am the tax last year I use my Roth IRA aren't you happy that he did something like that 'cause that's where my advisor told me to do and I said no actually that's probably the worst strategy to do that for you because remember that accounts always growing tax free and besides you didn't pay tax last year\nMaybe you could have done something more better because now even though you pay no tax next year you're going to be in a thirty three thirty five forty percent tax bracket later on down the road because you just did that [noise]\nNow did your advisor tell you that when they did did they tell you that it probably would have been better to use another that recount you just chose their off right now he told me to her she told me to exactly we should know how and when to pull money from these ...\nWould you rather use the money that's growing tax free or the money that's growing taxable I'd rather use the money that is taxable and let whatever's growing factory continue to grow tax rate\nRight or you say okay now I've got these tax to bird like IRAs and for all one case maybe I should spend some of those down first we're we've all been conditioned to spend them down last right because you're getting the power of compound in tax deferred and gross yes it's the way to do it\nNo it's not the way to do it all during the kicking the tax wrote down the kids like the government kick in our budget down the can down the road like our government kicking the national debt down the road eventually the rubber will hit the road and you're going to be hit with half the half the taxes\nLee the rubber will hit the road and you're going to be hit with half the hefty tax is make sure you understand how that works if you don't have a tax plan you do not have a financial plan\nRight interesting because never before meeting you would I ever think that my tax plan is associated with my retirement plan and our time planning to do with my tax plan\nRight well let's say you pay X. amount of money in taxes and what if you didn't have to pay that money in Texas now you get to keep it\nThat could make your money last longer [noise]\nI don't know I just think if I keep it from taxes I could have extra money go on vacation or\nIt could be the difference of watching for going on because\nI think uh keeping your money tax free is probably pretty good strategy in retirement after listening to Kevin Lloyd the show was called when retirement happens the website when retirement happens dot com that retirement checklist he's reading off from is right there on the website you can read it and read all thirty questions yourself right now\nWhen you are ready when you are within five years a retirement or if you are retired\nYou and or your spouse Kevin Lloyd here's the phone number [noise] he's waiting patiently their phone call through in four six four one tent and or the website when what time it happens like I'm\nBack in a moment on gay T. R. S.\nV. opinions you hear on the T. R. S. are those are the host callers and gas and that's a fairly those visitation it's management or order if you have comments or suggestions contact is a pain P. R. S. dot com thanks for listening\nTo the conversation on a a weekend here the big five fifty ... leaves are starting to turn\nAnd that means holiday season is right around the corner and that means we are one more week closer to retirement are you ready to even the gun to have that conversation what are you doing about getting tired well guess what I'm no longer do you have\nTo worry about it no longer do you put your head in the sand that's why Kevin ... here he is here to work with you to help you get to retirement because taxes\nAnd investing is different when it comes to retirement and Kevin always taught us that through in four six four one tent and his operators are not standing by buddy is there on Monday morning bright and early three one for six for one ten ten and the website is always open when retirement happens dot com\nThere is a tax or excuse me there was a time a checklist that we're working off that you can see for yourself or that the website when retirement happened is that God will give us another uh gives another question from the list there\nIs so one this is probably one that I've talked about a few times but I think it's still good for people to know and it says I considered the effects of a new way on my four one K. distribution and how it may or may not reduce my future income taxes anyway is when people do it any way as I say I have no idea but if if\nIt's ... there's a short for ... unreal lives depreciation it only comes into effect when somebody\nWorks for a corporation that you can actually buy the stock inside the four oh one K. and okay okay\nSo if you ever been buying your employer stock inside your four one K. you are eligible for potential attacks benefits is a big deal yeah it's huge deal I mean we talk about it in our tax workshop and I show people how to do this and\n\n\nWhy Carter was by God what are you ... down in our church to help make Missouri roads safer\nSings more lives dot com bust your lungs challenged\nBy at least here\nOn another year to Dave for calling Columbia do go for it gets wind of the the the number of wealth and talking\nAbout the Wildcats are sticks that one on one hand the the the hello again Bradford all go back with you on the concourse inside memorial stadium Mayfield our engineer\nHere in Jackson Weaver running thing back in jeopardy how did he do karaoke coming up on our voice the tigers Michaeleen like eight or doing great what a perfect day I'll get to say and I were just fall weather but really it's gorgeous for anything you want to\nDo it really is so hopefully people if they're not at the other way to go to Dave maybe there are enjoying some place around the great state of Missouri but man a an absolutely picture perfect day other nutrients going to get ...\nHave you ever seen a game turn on just a couple of ways like the home telling when I get up in the second quarter I really think that's a ...\nAnd just a couple of plays like a home when I get pissed and the second quarter I really think that's a possibility of getting a look at that stretch as the turning point for the whole\nThing is you had to put it on what you do today right can you follow it up but yeah I mean four consecutive plays in which you know it had to think to a turning point in which Missouri went from really clinging to a ... point lead at that point in time to really believe in the game of the game away Memphis is so or you know just crazy deal guys may plays well that's what it's about you have to go out and ... and that's what happened\nTo have been a struggle for the office ever since of manual hall got hurt but but that side of the ball was re last week sixty five point six hundred and forty six yards of total often what do you think tanks and well\nThey kept ... number one and number two they found a way to stretch for people vertically by using the tide ends up being credited ... really coming up with some great opportunities to take advantage of mismatch is that you have with our nuclear booed him and I think the same kind of maybe hold true a little bit today to it gets really really good Kentucky\nFor the tigers Kelly with us on the arrive alive tiger tailgate head coach area with them with us shortly let's talk about Kentucky kind of quietly the Wildcats if they're tied or improve their women total each of the last five years is pretty clearly marketed that team in Lexington how the Wildcats will they're\nBetter defensively if you look look what they're doing against the past a year ago at this point in time there were allowing two hundred and fifty one point six yards per game through the air this year just one eighty nine years with this this game is all about it's about the history because he is going to challenge ... man who today on both sides of the football runoff principally\nRug experience guys that are going to walk into you and I mean really locked into you're going to be and then they're going to block it diminished placed until they hear the whistle on the defensive side they're gonna come after and they've got guys that are just physical guys that love to compete\nIn Missouri won ... match it's outside with wide receivers [noise] can you get off on insurance because their employees press coverage today and you're going to face the men who also you know you got to be ready for that that's probably done it a great running back ... or ... you know you see\nYou next door to the first round that's always kind of thing right for the you know Josh Allen defence when he's probably going for ... a good team and more groups that are really good coaching a really good coaches to\nGet a little bit more into the deep end do they go up and then I looked at their numbers this week it's like holy cow let some points per game that's in the ... the second in the country and you went into that the other big physical guys yet but you also touched on\nThe experience that I mean I Believe their entire starting secondary as seniors that Allentown you mentioned probably ... definitely a pro I mean again with works there while they kind of don't suffer that rely on\nSix years right and so he's really doing a good job of building his ... Christian I can I can remember talking about this each of the last two years coach scoops has put his finger parental on on this program and how he's he's brought along with steady improving each and every year so you know we can talk more about that in a second because very old I'm standing by with our own group [noise]\nThanks very much trailers do we say hello and good afternoon to very owed them good to see your coach what a beautiful day for football\nYou to um to be back home this week and just like last week a beautiful day pro football in Columbia, Missouri [noise] should\nBe an

the day and what a great opportunity like you said a focus this week has been on ... and our best and we want to know what the end of the day the preparation\nBeen like for your team comes in practice

here in Columbia Mo we're joined now by land all our richer than you were just over a new arena right yet another these youth experience because you guys are just started recently that go today I went\nWell last year was the first year and a while the kids had a great time last year we want us to do a little bit more witness this year or so we had an academic learn shops which really or or for these youngsters opportunity for some hands on experience learned\nActually on the road to Arkansas to play the next night so we got we got tax for people that said hey we got an issue at her and we are water main break in and they started sending photos and I started looking at the thing that this isn't just a little water water break this is a big deal oh yeah we're on the road\nHow have the players responded to that and adjusted to a new location\nWell I think really well um I think they showed a lot of resiliency I think a lot of ah adaptability you you know you have no choice you know you just have to roll with it\nBut I I I was just funny ironically I told my wife you know we're coming full circle because our first five or six years here is do we ... our field house was our practice area wouldn't men's and women's basketball was still in there so it's not something that we haven't done before which I think helped\n... joining us his team up the twenty fourth in the country now that you know I went to I Want to start before we get into this recent run a good point I Want to start with a two game losing streak you had to Tennessee and Kentucky what do you think happened there after that that helps your team turned the corner well I think\nA couple of things happened I mean obviously you know people were disappointed with the outcome of that weekend and I think anytime that happens\nI think it's a great time for a little bit of self reflection on all fronts and and I think everybody's staff and players alike all look for things if you're going to if you're going to handle lend a positive way [laughter] I think what you do is you come back and you sit down and you kind of look for things that you can fix maybe look for things we can get better at\nA rather than just spending all of our time you know being bombed out 'cause we lost two matches you try to figure out why [noise]\nUm and and I think uh you know that helped a little bit by kind of just evaluating what we were doing what we could do better and of course one of those things I think we felt like a staff\nIs I think we had to look at offensive production a little bit\nUh which I don't think we were real happy with that that point a and and I think that next week and practice we made the decision that we needed to give Andre went to a little bit more time you know running the ... all the way round herself rather than switching in and out with a jade and knew some of the others that are\nIn honestly I think we found during that next week that we felt like that was going to be the way forward um and we went into that following weekend with that up and and we've been doing really well with that ... percent\nHighlight a recent round the reason why we're in the top twenty five is going to Florida you survive I Believe your mind to match point at one point you end up winning three games to to against a team at the top of the standings on the conference what is a win like that do for your program\nYou know I felt like we showed a lot of resiliency especially in that game when we were down all the time I mean that\nI mean it's hard to describe it you know in in a in a layman's terms just what kind of a whole we were in but it's it was literally I'm Talking about basketball team being down like twenty five points halfway through the second half and being able to find a way to come back and win and that kind of where we were at and that fits game\nBetween correct low for tiger volleyball joining us when they arrive alive tiger tailgating and his team hosting Texas a and M. tomorrow afternoon it was due arena some of the individuals who played well lately you mentioned the point that can lead to bird SEC player of the week\nAnd she's just one of the examples Illinois transfer a name that fans may not have known last year has been a huge contributor for her what is it has made her so successful\nWhich she's really doing um she's producing for us in a lot of different ways so it's not just tore attacking but she's blocking well she serving well\nSo she's going a lot of points for us um and she just provide a little bit of stability um it was kind of another change we made at one point early in the season um her in like a tour or other outside hitter we're only playing across the front row\nTraditionally over the years we've always been known for having one good back row swing um and when we went to the five one with Andre as a single setter that left us the ability to also leave one of those hitters in through the back row which right now is highly\nAnd she sent a really good job with just adding another dimension to the office and\nYou mentioned like or like a total number of men a senior team play a couple of times you know kinda diverge six for the expect her to be able to get up towards like five foot ate it is remarkable how high she's able to job\nShe is a phenomenal athlete a really special athlete I I just you know Susan and I've been doing this for a long time and I we haven't run into too many uh players that have the physicality the leg does and what makes a really good as she not only jumps out of the gym\nA but she also hit about his heart a ball as anybody I've ever seen so you know when you combine those two together you have somebody who really is a special talent then what life has been doing a really good job of this year so far I think is is really concentrating on becoming a better all around player\nYou know again this kind of like your use of basketball analogy again but somebody who's just great at taking it to the to the whole ... can't shoot outside or can't handle the ball\nYou know she's really done a good job of working on the other aspect suffered game that are going to really elevate her to another level I think one\nNamed it might be familiar to tiger fan of the list of ... she's still there for you in the middle of fast Walker and and the zoo history when you have someone like her in the middle how does that allow you to do different things defensively well\nYou know she takes up a lot of space and she can you know we often talk and volleyball where you know if you can't block the ball we want to channel it to somebody who can dig behind\nAnalysts are you at this point with her experience I mean that's where you separate I think a list of from a lot of our younger really talented players right now is it becomes a real thinking game at times and you have just the blink of an ...\nTo see something happening and making a decision as to where to go and went to go up and it's hard to do that and listen to with her experience and and just just stabbing his right now is really making a lot of really good read making a lot of really good decisions and that just puts a lot of pressure on the opposing team to try to go away from wherever she's at\nA minute volleyball head coach ... we could go through your whole roster of at this point but I Do want to ask you got more around the time about your coaching staff dynamic well\nI think those two have added um a lot to our our staff I mean I'm ... volt high level players I mean both national team level players\nUm they're both professional level players so I think the expertise in the game that they bring is really valuable there obviously I think it helps to have you on your staff to balance out my wife uh she visited the you know she'll kill me but um that's just reality\nI I Do like to ask anybody associated with all I've all this do you remember the first time you've got hit in the face by a volleyball [noise]\nUm I don't know if that's something that you know volleyball players really didn't want to admit to it ever happens because that kind of harder to kind of like getting dumped on in basketball you don't want to be that guy you know what I mean\nGive up the good work out ... thank you coach wing crack low joining us was hosting Texas A M tomorrow

Kentucky cc in town to visit with Missouri's\nShare more as he takes us inside the numbers jet always good to see how are you can you not be good on this day and it's really amazing you got it going today that's for sure whether you talk about we help certain people are just like\nEvery time you have all all the time you all year round just never dealt with our weather it of course not just the other happens some doubt so the tigers unfortunately in this Jerry's Kentucky one of the interesting numbers which\nSurprised some folks who was actually lost three and a role in the series with the Wildcats and obviously their fans want that to and here's a few hours yeah when you take a look at those areas and you're saying\nHe's on a very strange or tier three games get today when did you join the SCC and she was ... to help the upper hand early on them is the one the first three games as part of the lead authors to even it up since then\nAnd then the last two years of it is kind of looked at those hands on back a little early on in both of those contests in a Washington last year Kentucky jumped out of them ever seen it up\nWell in a Washington\nLast year Kentucky jumped out to American ended up the lead they like twenty seven at one point fingers came back and made a game and you remember\nIt went down to the very end they had to hold to dig out which was written in two years ago here in two thousand sixteen again Kentucky jumped up to Twenty one nothing new liberty five seven early in the second half so there's obviously needs to be up to a better start to have a good chance today and then\nLook a little deeper and in the numbers possession has been huge an equal as new games against these two teams the quarters played and those two ballgames was do only held advantages that was actually in each quarter one time one out all those times\nIn two thousand sixteen here you have the ball for almost forty minute just twenty from ... to one time it was a shouldn't [noise]\nAnd then last year even though the game was more eat and the ugly but you still have the ball for thirty six minutes twenty brief um issue in almost a quarter so tigers got a you know you fall behind it's hard to come back and you don't have the ball very\nBut yeah that would be their recipe for success Kentucky and not a surprise to see their dominance the last three games with the physician category in their favor\nInteresting as we studied for this gave us we do throughout the week in crunching numbers you view and I have to say what a fun game to analyze because its strength again strength\nFlaw if you will against the law the strength of the team's going up and they haven't been the weaker units of the team to fill up they had then got numbers to prove that we are talking about ... it does make it such an intriguing match up in many ways but as you say that the strength of opinions I think it's fair to say is ... ...\nIt on the other side of the ball obviously Kentucky is not put up a great numbers but certainly recently at least on a while and soccer defence when you know we all know well documented that they've had their\nChallenges throughout the year but uh you know so many times it seems like in these kinds of games when you got the strength to kind of cancel each other out in his whichever one of the the weakest says if you will have a better day makes a difference but\nSo you look at those numbers of Kentucky a course of the brain deep it's coming in today there's there's often will break off into the terms of oil yards and this is national and international so uh Kentucky seventeenth versus the run and decency allowed a hundred and twelve yards again and they are twelve and ... it's not like to have a\nWeakness on that side of the ball\nTigers come in rank thirty seven groaning the ball just that two hundred yards the game and Eighteenth and passing just a three hundred so again it'd be very interesting to see what side they're in control things but then again the key should be\nThe other units has the upper hand today you know you look at the numbers are not real pretty but Mr whose deepest comes in Ninety six in total defense in terms of yards allowed Kentucky as often as right there are two one oh one of the nation and total opposite of\nWhen you look at the strength of all those to Dubai as soon as you as best they match up really well Missoula as best as stopping the wrong Frank thirty six nationally against their own Kentucky is best at running of all their rank Nineteen so again just many ways you can look at it [noise]\nIt it just to say I have no idea what's going to happen today we\nNever do sometimes we think we do and sometimes we're maybe more accurate than we are three other times but this is a fascinating match it but it really is for many of the reasons\nYou just described so well in Kentucky though you say strength is they're deep and say okay well yeah they got given up more than twenty points in the game to shoot at like seven games champ\nYeah the number there is Tony as you say at the most points given up by Kentucky nation so far this year that puts them at the uh allowing just under a Thirteen points a game with them as a number to scoring defense nationally so\nUh you know fans would like to think they maybe had not gone up against that often like well Missoula offers but again we'll have to see the motion\nThey allowed those twenty at Texas a and M. and they're only last year and that was an overtime you otherwise they also gave us her only to central Michigan the very first game and here we\nAre and you know again what they do well with specifically seventeenth against their own little short single out running this year was just a hundred and twenty yards to line up so obviously the zoo is you know we talk about cyber possession the way you control the clock is running the ball successful is so I'll see how the tigers can put that\nIn another way that you can analyze it on paper and the Jews often does appear to be the best one that Kentucky will face so far this year when you look at the numbers overall\nAre in South east side PS opponents\nComing into today for their previous five MPs opponents collectively average Seventy in the country in terms of total office you know what's your individual team rankings so and obviously we said no she was twelve and then the head of the nation and so often so again up steal that bears out\nNovels don't park resort is dirty private eight years of magnificent woods and unique stone

Kentucky is you know over the\nCourse of the last few weeks or played as good as anybody in the country um IT our our team is\nAs prepared are ready to go play in a bill put our best shot out there for we talk about your team let's talk about them for a little bit to me the more of a good team is when you're not playing well to be able to find a way to win I thought they did that last week against federal they did and you know the the conditions we had with the wind or they had the same thing maybe a little bit more\nSo they adjusted their their game and their attack or didn't didn't really attempting anything through the air but did enough running the ball or to score points and then they relied on their defense to carry them and and when the game and they were able to\nUm on the ground attack really manage the game like you need to and in a situation like that and and I'm adjusting and then it worked out for why he has been a smell so good at what he does or they go up front there they're really good outfits whine there's solid they play well together\nA but also he's got tremendous vision and he's okay picking up for yards and lining up and going and doing it again so\nThere's a number of reasons one it starts with her off into line too I think he's a great vision good power finishes the runs the right way they're off into blind will test your poisons Walker ever stop you know they they play they play down there will coach but also uh they play through the whistle man you know the thing for our team\nIs to make sure that that we probably wants to have the

remind them to drive this joke in a story that you know he he is a basic stuff does I respect that a pretty simple like yours are true\nYou know you got to take it with a grain of salt start with the ownership because what your number one you still work with the team so obviously you have to be considerate in your tales about the the blue notes but I\nThe only real ownership I\nGot to know and I knew very well is when Sidney Solomon\nWas at the helm of things 'cause he and dad were they were friends in we'd go out to the farm and hang out in the pool and I'd hang out with his kids so I knew that family but you look at the lower reasons some of the other piano hands jackets and she and her hands I didn't get that close to but they seem like on the surface\nAll very different personalities how would that trickled down to a player did that change things much for you\nHe did John I mean I I really I mean when you look at it I mean there's but eight different ownership group so that was a sense I care and that's all there's been there's been a cause I was here last year the salt before they see the ... so yeah it's changed I mean I I think when you look at\nWhat goes on with the with the ownership group I mean the the group that we have right now is is that is their study buddy they're trying to win a Stanley Cup and everybody is aware of that and they've been very vocal about what they're trying to do here say all those but uh do you go back to the euro with\nA hurry or ... things were were a lot different than all the major effect on a ship even I'm going to solve it is

the kill much better team are very very quickly with it well France is at the helm was he was able to\nMake trade and spend money and so yeah it it it has a huge effect on who you're trying to play for the ownership is is very very involved in the war he was spent more money\nPlay for the ownership is is very very involved in the war he would spend more money I think that any body else a try to win to John told us this last do Marcia where we have now so it it it changes from ownership the ownership and certainly a when they want to spend money it it's a it's a bigger effect for the

we came here and of course I got married after two years to ... and my wife Bernadette\nUh when we came back here and we just we always thought this was just a great place to raise a family just the

General Robert would he was in the United states military\nAnd was a procurement officer for uh the Panama Canal projects so if anybody understood the intricacies of global supply and demand it was this guy\nAnd in the early Nineteen twenties\nHe saw the automobile was going to be a huge factor in changing the way that Americans shop and he was going to the executives at Montgomery Ward where he worked at the time\nWas saying look we really need to go into retail and the executives at ward said you know we don't want to hear anything about that we were going to stick with what made us a mail order and eventually fired Robert would because he just wouldn't let up on this idea of retail stores and so uh the day he was fired he went directly to uh to Sears, Roebuck\nWhich at that point was under the direction of a man named Julius Rosenthal who's really considered sort of the progressive of the company and Roosevelt understood that this guy was a genius and hired him immediately in Nineteen twenty four and by Nineteen twenty five they were building their first retail stores\nAnd a retail really took off and it was really that time that that she started to get on the map or at least regionally 'cause most of my research has been here in the south I'm\nSears really during the Nineteen thirties and during the depression that you really spent a lot of money and effort in reaching out to the American farmer who was suffering more than anybody at that point\nAnd uh here in the south they they tested all manner of things here at the Atlanta plant they actually had a farmer's market to try and get farmers to come into town and sell their wares diversify their crops and those types of things they used to have like a home canning demonstrations and had a a\nSummer a

and Hartford, Connecticut and San Francisco and uh I always sort of say\nThey they put all their eggs in sort of the beta max basket they invested millions in this program and by Nineteen Ninety five Ninety six had been surpassed by America on line and Internet Explorer because\nThey were a little more user friendly I think but uh yeah Sears cheers had a lot of interesting things that they were doing at that time some people say that that was\nShe had a lot of interesting things that they were doing at that time some people say that that was part of their downfall as well\nAre still involvement does discover end of all the companies\nAll their separate entities now Sears just sort of help get them off the ground but um [noise] you know I I've spoken with a number of retirees who say you know in the seventies and eighties which many of us consider the pinnacle of the company a lot of them are retirees who are workers shoes at the time so that was really where they started to lose touch with their their working class roots\nUri all state insurance named after a tire that's you\nKnow it was actually made an actress Mississippi at one point they they that was one of the first plant fears helped to bring to the south that was another thing that Sears did\nFor the southern region was as they came down and and invested heavily in industry and are at contracts with factories around the region like the uh the tire plant nachos where you know they were not only supporting farmers but also expanding and industry\nClearly you love to see her as well and then what [laughter] what sparked this fascination with seniors\nWell much like you guys I mean I grew up in the Nineteen seventies and and the rural south and\nAnd I was an only child so that makes me a little special I spend a lot of hours with that catalogue and and you know by the Nineteen eighties the economy improves and we all start going and shopping and the brick and mortar stores and and almost forgot about fears and when I went back to college\nI was sort of shocked as you read through a particularly southern literature and history this constant\nMention of fears is this an integral part of southern culture and I'm like wait a minute this companies from Chicago\nHow did this happen and so I decided to sort of dive into it and\nLet me tell you it's been it's been one heck of a rabbit hole\nOr you're going to become a historian on Wal Mart now that it was on her made their bed\nAnd again you know we mentioned this earlier and I just missed it because I didn't believe there was this huge thing but somebody texted is a ... animals a serious thing\nI'm not sure if that was the Sears brand or not I know skins was and I know that I had some gr animals you know you match the tag\nI'm wearing them now you\nGot a job and it got to make it to be on the website out that people want to go down memory lane on line\nI actually I don't know you can find me a jury a jury underscore Hancock at Yahoo dot com um but other than that yeah yeah I I as a public school teacher I have a lot of time or resources or anything like that 'cause it's it's pretty demanding job\nBegging for making time for us we pay to appreciate your ideal meal\nAnd I forget sometimes that the Sears Tower yeah the Old Spice years\nI mean this guy is obsessed with ... that it's like you think he brings that up on dates\nI'm not sure he has a lot of those I don't know if you could be a married guy\nHe's he was a nice guy was a nice guy like upset and he got a chance to chat ... I'd be interested to see if anybody's selling one of the old Sears catalogs\nAnd and what they're going for I mean they've been gone for a while like we should buy it and send it to this guy might send them into or drive man he is home might be made them already got them home ... years used to sell houses\nI'm home now and a lot of these how they'll banker right are still standing lands and was this here's a thing to well if you own a home if you're buying food goes she's here comes something I can only lead\nAnd you need to get your carpets cleaned and I'm just ... years didn't do that is a true clean carpet spot I think maybe you could rent one of those ... may be you don't want to know that when you can have the green stuff now when you could have a different green organic pre spray on\nTrade he asked they don't use shampoos no residue is left in the carpet to re attract dirt it's true\nClean carpet and I'm telling you call these people and this is you I use\nTo clean the carpets in my home and I'm pretty per se ... when it comes to my ...\nRight now to Glenn carpet is offering this value that you won't believe you're going to think I'm renting it wrong chances are good that I Am writing it wrong but I Know I'm not look up ... on the jury room special Harvard cleaning protest one hundred and thirty nine dollars I don't know how to spell it\nFor rooms of carpets cleaned for one hundred and thirty nine dollars and when you mentioned my name's Julie Bach you get to room Scott scarred protected or pet owner treated for free these carpets are\n... going to happen I Will get to a legal stuff will start at one of the stupid question John largely known for these um I saw a story you spend a week or so ago I'm\nOn Facebook about a guy who had committed a crime in a pretty serious crime I don't remember exactly what it was\nUm but there was reward offered for information leading to the rent and you see that quite often you know thirty five thousand dollars offered to information leading to the rent so there was a story that the guy who committed the crime\nOh there was a story that the guy who committed the crime seriously considered turning themselves in show he did collect thirty five thousand dollars or whatever it was and I thought you know why\nWhy why couldn't you do that because basically saying I'm your guy he's pretty damn good information into getting your man\nI think it's great [laughter] it's it's so funny you can't believe is you can't make this stuff up\nNo so did he get the money does he get the money\nWell you know he's not going to get the money\nHe got his son in law were you benefit from your own ... and you know they're not\nGoing to reward him for bad behavior but I'm\nNot as much as I Do not get anything\nThough he's not going to get it um you know I mean you know they're not gonna pay 'em I think it's a great way to do it I Hope it happens more often\nYeah well I just like I Love the stories of the police departments and a note to people that have more and saying hey congratulations you want a new flat screen TV and then he'll come pick it up to twenty two eighty five dollar but this Saturday\nBetween five and then we'll give you your TV and behind the building there's the budget squad cars and budget people with in God's in is these people come in are you Mr John ... science or\nHow Bo yes okay that you know we uh side warrants out here as for parking tickets please the officer so and so you know television they are just ... to the pokey\nYeah they don't even get a TV in the ...\nYou know you don't get a TV but isn't that entrapment I mean I wasn't one of my schedule questions for you but what about that situation\nNo that's actually not entrapment because you're not trying to lure them into breaking the law [noise] um it might be you could call it deceitful you know your your but um if not entrapment entrapment would be to encourage you to actually break the law what\nCan they still get out of it because they were brought in under false pretenses\nNo they they get a brand new pair of Greece located\nJust go to jail alright so I'm gonna I'm just going to play to save and buy all my TVs\nRight okay go to Best Buy All right good to know\nBut you know a whole right everyone's got lottery madness talk about that\nA ... eight hundred million or more than that and you know the legal question becomes say it's you and not do that it's going to happen any of his sadly\nBut is it is let's talk about how you get your ducks in a row and some people that say how many to twenty five year pay off where you give me thirty nine million a year or I Want to be three hundred million right now and take what you needs why do people believe in\nI Want to spread it out why not give me the money All right now and I'll do something else with it why the option even there\nWell I I think it depends on your age and tax consequences um but I think a lot of people will say the first thing you need to do is call a lawyer and I I think that's not that's not a bad idea I think you're more to do than that I think you want to call a financial advisor\nOr you may want to call a lawyer for a state planning reasons because you know now you do have a large estate assets they're going to have to determine what's gonna happen to them once you pass\nAnd I think the other thing you really want to look into as asset protection a once you're given that kind of money but whether you take it for twenty five years or a lump sum I think there's tax consequences there or you might want to look into and a financial advisor may may be the right person to talk to\nNearly cos\nYou always can call lawyer especially if it's me and you want to share\nYeah yeah I mean yeah that's always a good idea and it did say you've got five kids you knew when you want to get the money to them without them getting smacked with tax consequences I Know you're not a tax attorney\nBut is there a way that they can be awarded some of that cash to directly or did you have to go to you and then you get to do my twenty grand a year or\nWhatever I minored in it as it may you know\nThey're going to first give it to you okay because I don't think the lottery of their agreements not to give it to others but surely going to give it to you but then you can gifted and then there are there's other means other ways to transfer\nHe may put it into a trust and then there's different types of trust that they can either have control over it immediately or later on so you know what if you're going to get eight hundred million dollars I think you're going to want to get some advisors and consultants or talk to them before you take that back\nOr the drones on friday on Saturday mornings now for the story on the legal that's making all the news internationally now at this point is the girl downtown and the law to wouldn't let the black guy in the building because she didn't know if the necessarily lived there and he\nSaid I live here and and kind of\nAnd he was filming her while she was all happening so we've all seen the tape or among the most\nWas seeing the tape we kind of heard the story what is the legal stunk here I mean it's it's not a stand your ground because you know the castle doctrine said you know somebody comes into my house I have all the rights in the world to do whatever I Want to them but what if they live in the same building thinking I'm an area where there's a ... yeah\nRight so you're the stand your ground or should not apply in a common area that would be more on your own apartment your own home you you may be able to use that some people are trying to use it in their cars other place of business [noise]\nUm so I think that would be an issue if it's if in one of those but in the common area really [noise] um it's it's not that wasn't were was designed to be use you may still attempt to use it there because really what stand your ground does\nIf it's just a burden shifting it used to be before stand your ground I suppose it was me I could use um the defense of self defense\nTo the ... you know why I don't even want to use it for myself to say I killed somebody but let's do it for the hypothetical but they were accusing me of murder I could say well I was um it was self defense so it's justified\nBut what they did was stand your ground as they shift the burden of proving\nSo now the state or the prosecutor has the burden of proving that it was something other than self defense or the presumption is that if I'm at home and I would shoot somebody that it was self defense now the state has to come in there and say no no it was in self defense\nSo even if it's in a common area I guess you could use that\nUm that defense and and shift the burden to the state but we don't think it's going to hold up and certainly not in this case where there was a video I'm ... and this is one where I when I saw it on TV the first thing I thought it was oh my God where is this is this New Yorker where is this a long behold I realized it was St Louis\nAnd so it actually happens here too\nYeah that type setting that that happened the way it did and then she ended up losing her job she\n[noise] yeah I don't know that I feel sorry for her losing her job but she didn't lose her job\nAnd they fire you for that even though that had nothing to do with the working hand yeah\nYeah that's a that's a great question and so the answer would be if they're if if she was working under some type of ...", "show_name": "The Carney Show", "year": "2018", "city":

how did you how did you get down that path\nTo pass the Haitian on it yeah well for me is not a vocation we're calling right I'm In Nineteen Ninety nine I was called to be a preaching minister and in two thousand three um\nTook over the church I cheer of calling and if this is too personal just tell me and go back to age jokes on but you know you hear about people with awakenings with calling ...\n... was there like a moment in time was it a voice was it something you saw happened that symbolizes that you should be doing something else or what what may determine what made you go the way he went\nThrough study through study of the Bible that laid the foundation and things that were happening in in life I didn't want to do this did you grow up in a religious home no no not really so where do I come from to begin with the study but I was I Would you even pick up a Bible\nMy wife yeah that way when ... when I say I want you to go to a Bible study with me right okay so I had a\nCouple of engineering degree so I knew how to study so I started studying and right and it just kind of went from there but I this is something that I did not want to do so that's why since that has a calling right because I was running from it I did not want to hear at all but uh\nAnd that's usually what it is calling us something that's the opposite of anything you were off when\nYou're working with kids now are what are you doing in the community to help lift people up\nOr right now I Am I'm president ... school board for the last two years and so my involvement in in that in trying to transform a

and also I Would think it also represents a growth in the community\nVery much growth and transformation because this was a twenty three million dollar bond that is the community pass so we're all in on education because that's going to be transformative to that particular community also also do some a mentoring work\nAnd he's with school district and the river valley school district so I'm heavily involved with the kids\nThat's great we love to hear that and then how did you and David meat and how did the two you get together for but\nSpoke apparel so David and I'm met in seminary

in the corner penalty time it surprises you may be\nVery intelligent very book smart that I'm not a big issue right he's trying to come up off the fleet [laughter] but I I'm\nYou know I'm David we we just we just hit it off we just started talking about things and I'm asked him what he did and he talks about the students and I was a pastor at the time so I said well what do you think about the um you know making me a couple of suits and um I think my first order was I think\nUm you know making me a couple of suits and um I think my first order was I think\nOr four suits and I'm just to let you know\nBack in two thousand ten they were they they were ... they had cos you still have my doubts other item out alive or they're they're done at that point there is the master was like two Ninety or two Seventy at the time really yeah when I when I met David I was about to sixty five\nI'm In the year two thousand I was three hundred pounds how'd you lose the weight or did you have a growth spurt\nSpiritual growth spurt rifle lost all the weight of focusing on a life what did I Want to do so that uh the motivation to have to come from you know not from me so that part of my my worship in is a part of my old to my family\nA need to live as long the life as I can so therefore for them this is what I Do so if the motivation is not me than I Will always be motivated to continue on especially on days that I don't feel like it\nSo over the course of the last Seventeen years I've lost about a hundred and ten pounds so right now I'm about five pounds over where I graduated high school it while\nI I actually way less than what my driver's license says which that's pretty rare\nI just never changed it I mean I just bought what they said after the lion when I was sixteen and I think I'm Still line today to ... know that a drought and\nNow there's fire but I always write it actually says if you're joining us pastor Cedric port is with us from the third Presbyterian Church\nWhich you will find on a Lewis and Clark and another satisfied customer of David ... spoke apparel\nWhere we are and David also allowed to and not to make this like joy is Sam but while we're on the road is safe and we're talking about such thing as long as we're better drivers first of all of them to join us there's a second they get out of the ...\nIs able to uh take stocks on prayer and his feelings are about faith to work because he's a minister year Colyer so it's a big difference so your philanthropy and your theology spills out in a different way here\nI Would think would be this this suiting up soldiers let's talk about that\nYes I\nHave always been focused on the ministry of my clothing business if not a\nCareer that really is a calling I've the athletes I've been around the F we get the Sunni business out of the way quickly and then we spend an hour and a half in prayer talking about a very serious situation in their life\nI could name probably ten right now that are still with us because of our prayer time together I mean literally with us\nAnd it really showed me I mean all along the way that this isn't about the clothing it's about the human relationships it's about building bonds between peoples that normally wouldn't necessarily interact\nAnd I'm not necessarily a soldier I was born in a little bit late for the Vietnam War and they wouldn't have taken me anyway not that late but dad was in the Korean War and it really struck home when I kept hearing stories of men and women coming home making that transition from a\nMilitary uniform which was given to them and provided by you know they cleaned it they did everything for it\nTo now have to be swimming in a pond they had no clue how to do\nHow do you do the stroke of business and they need the help so the idea is to hear the stories of these heroes yet this out get this in the community so that people know about them and their struggles and of course we'll pick four to\nTo close her head to toe so that they can then go to the job interview\nYou looked at by someone the other the other senses are constantly in in action\nBased on what you see and make an effort into making that first and second third and fourth and before you open your mouth you're making so many impressions and once you do\nThen you've got to be followed up with consistency you're nominating people or the public or the public I Want the public to nominate their heroes tell me about their stories we will choose what the panel of of pasture and some others that will choose for that we really think deserve\nAnd the rest were given Syria's discount too and we're we're actually starting a foundation that can\nThat can underwrite they can underwrite for hero oh that's great what is the timeframe on October thirty first is are cut off so we can sit down and and analyze all the applications and the where did they go to do this exactly yes or send us an email that suit up\nYou know so you you pick right up there last night we went back to the Americans after about three months off and not only could I not careful you what episode we left it took me about forty five minutes to figure out which season\nOh wow you left off and we found\nOur spot and I got about a sea is not a half left oh good okay\nVery very tiring almost his diaries listening to that explanation\nDid you watch ... and the uh the the ... the Roseanne\n... the the ... the Roseanne redo\nI did in fact I have a little story about that so NBC did not release screeners of it the way they normally network or they just\nPut it in their ... and you can watch it on your computer or whatever um you had to go to a special screening and either LA or New York to watch the first two episodes in order to write a review which is what I did I went went up to New York to watch it um but I've seen the first two I including the one that aired this week\nAnd you're you know um I liked it I thought it was funny and in a lot of weight as weird as it sounds without Roseanne Barr and that\nIt felt more uh in line with the original kind of tone and sensibility of um the\nThe original series and the really good um earlier this year so you know I don't know what kind of longevity and has a fairly but again I think I said before when we were talking about this a few months ago\nYou know you've got John couldn't you've got loyal Metcalf you got here it Gilbert and he's got a a really strong group of actors and characters that we've also come to care about and that and they can carry a show pretty well all by themselves\nBut do you think that they bite us not screened it um because they weren't sure they weren't going to fire anybody else before cable TV\nNo I don't ... the the concern which I honestly thought was kind of silly would they did not want people to talk about how they are going to get off the show and in fact we had to agree in writing that when they're not going to reveal the circumstances of that explained why look in hunter wasn't on the show any more even know\nIf you watched last year and I think even Roseanne Barr has said something because I figured out why she would be gone\nBut they did not want us to talk about and dancing with gang weirdly secretive about that\nShould we stay how it happened I don't want to do I want to know Goodman told us that though I Do want she tripped and fell into a raise the stranded\nYeah or how did they killed Charlie Sheen he got hit by a Bush yeah it was something\nReally it didn't not nice for me I got a got hit by a train or something\nYou're going to do a mall or gigantic it sank yell or got shot and they had All right then they couldn't see me will really of them to\nDo your benefit of the doubt if they haven't seen it by next week and we'll just weeks but Jen I'm Amazed I mean you worked for a an online and print publication it's it's a fantastic ... dot com it as well as New York magazine\nThey sent you all the way to New York city from Washington DC just to watch a TV show New York\nI thought that far [laughter] oh yeah big deal I mean the half hour ago I also got\nTo spend some time in the office I mean ideally I go to the office you know\nA regular basis just to see people in person and sell it served that are you\nGetting able to watch the show and write the review\nOr rebooting are alias and it was one of my I don't recommend it to anyone because I don't think the\nArtistic value is there at the end of the day but it was my guilty indulgence and not just seeing her in polyester but I talked to were slung corky little episodes and it was a good show I'm Glad it's coming back do we know who's playing her role or she can do it again\n[noise] I actually don't know and and I I Would I Would be concerned to have somebody else in that role that isn't Jennifer Garner um I think a lot of the appeal of that show was not only her but\nA lot of the other people in the cash including from nobody you've probably never heard of named Bradley Cooper\nRight oh yeah yeah the ... Bradley Cooper\n[laughter]\n... back up their Lady Gaga I Know that\nWhat it is and probably part of it being that she's tied up with a show on HBO Now\nYes he's in the show a camping um which is from ah Lena Dunham in guinea Connery dead at girls' high and you know she is terrific and\nI Wish I liked the show a little bit more than I Do uh it's about a a bunch of people middle age people on a camping trip people are constantly fighting with each other ah so your tolerance of how much of that you can watch a little a very um but there are parts of it that are definitely funny\nOkay and what about making of a murderer season too [noise]\nSo here's here's another fun I'm saying they they're in a bar go on that which we discovered today we accidentally published I review before he goes to a bar code it until tomorrow which is when it comes out\nAt night again I Believe that's related to secrecy they don't want people to to say too much about what is and the fees that and even though and I think that there's an issue for the second season like the making of murder sure there were probably people who followed the Steven every case\nBut if you didn't it just took a wild story of this guy who gets exonerated for for committing one crime gets out of jail and then just a couple of years later is back in jail accused of murder that he said he didn't commit um\nWe've all this story has become so high profile that you know I think a lot of people are much more aware of it and also tracking what's been happening in that and that's really what the season is about the tense you appeal I'm Steven every case or not the ... case and sort of how that has continued first came out\nI don't know how they're going to stretch this into another season the television I thought that eight or ten episode arc which probably two episodes too long as it was well I think that mother really carry the whole show you shoot shot [laughter] you know she's not doing news coverage or whatever I which I don't I don't\nThink I'll get in trouble with Netflix for saying that there are a lot of phone conversations go yeah yeah\nOh yeah are you sure their daughter was a bar good when they told you you had to go to New York for the screening come on Jen on which the pieces together and we got a scoop put thank you for the time will read your culture got kind of course five thanks for keeping us up to speed\nThank you I'd be well by Jenny Sanford\nWho I bet she wishes she was here is broken down because there's nice women's ... you know is a suit after the man's predicament or watch making a murder you've never heard anyone to put it off it seemed too long\nNow you've got to give it a minute if he if if you go you have to make that commitment and promised me you'll go to and a half episodes for sure\nWhether wife when maybe two episodes and she was like this isn't going anywhere so when she said that about you [noise] do you think you really just five\nOr six annual fine wine and restaurant holiday expo or as you know I was honored by acronyms you have to ... to live a\n... that's the that's the one\nNever mind it is friday November ninth and fans or wine need to go to this and you get a chance to buy some wine it's a great pricing and names like ... but and I'm getting lists every day a ... a robber Craig game is Paul Hobbs\nOh poor cat and you're a robber Craig cameras Paul Hobbs Alexander rally the prisoner or one of my favorite blanche they're going to be there also that wine tastings seven to ten\nOn November at night and because you've got the Hamilton's behind this there's going to be cooking demonstrations and food served complimentary food and ... and included in your ticket price from ... from eleven eleven and from Hamilton's\nSteakhouse so I don't know why you wouldn't go um sometimes you get a bit of a back up a bit of a line that some of the places like came is or whatever but you know what for an extra\nTwenty five bucks you get that special upfront preview or early entry ten dollar voucher towards the purchase very wind that night and limited only Seventy five people um\nSo that's a nice way to take it into either way if if you like the grape juice this is an event to catch probably the wine as I Am of the year in St Louis to six and you'll find one in restaurants holiday expo\nBrought to you by Hamilton hospitality get short tickets at ... events dot com and plan on coming down to move on friday November night to schmooze is next [noise]\n\nHere in Missouri has over two thousand bridges rated in poor or we restricted condition\nAnd getting more dangerous every day for our kids' school buses in emergency vehicles to cross it\nSays that's why ... on the ballot the gas tax was last increased twenty two years ago inflation's eroded sixty percent of its buying\nPower we couldn't live on what we made in Nineteen Ninety six\nExactly and ... have to be regularly audited and constitutionally designated
