didn't want\nTheir you're probably going to spray it to kill the crop that you didn't want to you're going to if you if you're if you're running beans and you got corn coming up you're going to spray and then you'll slowly she those corn stalks dry up\nAnd go away but now this time of year if you drive down rural America roads and you look out across the beat a cornfield that's been harvested cornfield that's been a harvest it say maybe a month six weeks ago eight weeks ago and all of a sudden now it's all green again\nIt's covered with corn\nCorn all coming back up those are kernels that were lost through to come by\nYeah and you'd think my God how much did they lose how can that be you know how many how much corn went out the back of that combine the sticker now than it was when they planted it\nWell there's actually a way to formulate whether or not you combine working right or not ... would you care to\nTell them about that no other year you're answering this question so you're you're yeah there yeah I'm trying to do anyway okay in a perfect world you go behind the combine and you take a a square one foot square one by one foot square\nYou take three you lay it on the ground behind the combine after you've shelled the corn not before after All right you lay it on the ground you brush away all the little ... and all the little corn pieces and all that and you count the colonel's inside the box laying on the ground [laughter] okay\nSo you do that in three places left side of the combined center they combine right side of the combat you take those numbers so you got five in one box in three in another and known in the other had those three up your bottom by three\nSo if you find that there are about to kernels of corn found in that area that's equal to a bushel of corn left in the field\nAbout that wow so then you you might say well how many she would've Bush will be to make it look like grass you might say\nYou might say I'll say so how many green ... how many All right so how many colonels or know this could be on the trivia question boys pay attention I'm trying to teach you guys something\nAll right you know ... in a bushel of corn Fifteen and a half percent moisture which is kind of word that she'd corneas when you're back\nNow I Do very just a little bit but Ninety thousand seeds per bushel\nSo have you lose a bushel of corn out of the back of your cornfield proud of your back to your combining the cornfield technically speaking there could be Ninety thousand plants growing on that acre ground\nThat's pretty ... now you know\nWell now here's here's what I Would have thought All right I didn't even really think about I I just figured the technology there probably wasn't much corn and getting out the back but when I saw the cone of corn\nWhen he was a down\nYou know combining in the field down below last week I saw all of the the the Conan corn a that was on the top you know I I figured that out as far as the hopper that's where it's fallen off for that and I and and you know let's put it this way\nAs as many seeds and and kernels that get in the field how many are left after the deer go pillaging because they've been out in huge numbers going through the leading court\nOh yeah they're eating the corn and that you have you know the the thing of it is the new combines years and years and years ago\nYou know you used to be able to go out there behind a combine and find all kind of car mhm when we were Boy Scouts now you got to realize that was eighty years ago but when we were Boy Scouts we would have weekend camp outs this time of year and we would take burlap sacks and we'd walk walk farmers' fields\nAnd we were filled sack after ... after sack\nOf corn and then we would take it and take it to the elevator the farmer would let us do it and then we sell the corn and we have that much money to put into the into our little kitty you know but now a rabbit will starve to death behind a combine\n[laughter] there's ... there's that little bit of corn is going out the back now it looks like a big you know you see those fields 'cause that she's been laying there long enough it's been warm enough there's moisture and all that corn I volunteer current coming up and you look across there and it's all green using man\nDid he replant that field or what you know that's what's coming out the back of the Columbine about the roughly Ninety thousand plants per acre if all and that's only if you combine set right now it doesn't take much of a um you know a little\nUh dragging your combine settings and that could be two or three bushel per acre\nNow you're looking at you know a couple of hundred thousand plants per acre and that's why those fields look like they do so there you go for it and I was French\nYeah how about all that numbers for early in the morning tolerable\nWhy that's why they number late classes in school [laughter] up till noon you weren't very good to go to Phil noon to fire
