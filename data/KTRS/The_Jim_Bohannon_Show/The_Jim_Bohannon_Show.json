show dot com you can follow me on Twitter at Jim bode talks and as I\nLook out on this great national crazy quilt of public discussion these days with all of its animosity like it's hard not to notice the glitter because goodness knows we are a celebrity obsessed society\nAnd celebrities have an outsized into very disproportionate influence on the national discussion to reason examples jumped out of me there have been many over the years certainly a\nA recall the the big discussion that President Trump had with Meryl Streep some years ago uh not ever face to face fortunately or it could have gotten\nA very confrontational but I Know the two recent examples of a pop stars who have become part of the national discussion Kanye West coming out end up strongly backing President Trump\nAnd before that\nIt's not that long ago a Taylor Swift recovery is our [noise] who up came out regarding the uh the tennis it did as a Senate race that what she of course as a a\nWho came out regarding the uh\nThe tendency you did as a Senate race that what she of course is a a native of that state and her opposition to Republican Marsha Blackburn over Democrats feel president [noise] and I looked at those first of all I Will give due credit to each there's no question about the fact\nThat the both of these people express\nTheir opinions as Americans for which they have every right so to do and uh probably did so at some jeopardy into their own careers are certainly a with a\nA a a fan base and as a predominantly African American Kanye West has not gain any support or a new listeners by virtue of supporting President Trump says\nHe's a he's probably suffered some economically Taylor Swift of course in the country genre wondering only look back to the Dixie Chicks remember them [noise]\nAnd ah I doubt that Taylor Swift will receive any a career benefit from her statement so I grabbed courage to both of them they spoke their minds even if it may have angered me the base of their uh popular support\nBut that's as far as I think it should go\nAt heart of course in such statements by each is the notion that we should somehow listen more to people who are essentially well known because of their well known ness [noise]\nTo find the best senior living communities across the country and free service that number to call a\nPlace for mom at one eight hundred for six seven

amazing\nWell thank you very much on on humble by that and then the widespread absolutely\nTrue you're ...\nI basically agree with everything you would have to say about ... except for this\nI'm not sure I trust their motives\nI mean ... there's not primarily country anymore she had been primarily up and that the question I get it that ... top probably more to the left and right there with a different story with Dixie Chicks I gave them credit because they were primarily country\nAnd they did actually they suck up the other day that that's a big yeah I'm not sure I trust Kanye West's motives either\nI'll have to wait and see if\nI'd have to wait and see anything happen and there's all this support [noise] I'll I'll just have to wait and see\nI see what you're saying and ... and

thanks very often what would have said are counted got up there and told him or ... or above holy was all this other stuff but he's still be a great man you know ...\nI think we know our president well enough to know now that no the the president will lay on the heavy\nHeavy a compliment if he liked what you say and heavy complaints if you don't so do I I think it is you use really of Andrew drone question there David no obviously a walk west said had everything to do with what the president had to say in response\nA Charlie in Manhattan, Kansas and the good evening Charlie welcome\nSurge jumbo or doing five well sir thank you\nWell you know a lot of people in this country running drone all the time about your age maybe a little over but\nPeople don't have a critically saying let somebody else to sink in for him and the one thing I heard the U.S or on the Internet today are sold it for ex President Carter\nWas a great thing because he said that Kavanaugh was not\nA because the layout burst and they wait inducted himself his performance in the hearings where you know he knows Carter been there a court room at the Capitol\nFinancial decisions he made I really do one thing you see what I mean\nThe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges have been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react very intensely he would probably out Kevin Cavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context that Kavanaugh wrote\nAn apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so [noise] yeah I I can I must say I I put Jimmy Carter the category of\nWho cares quite frankly I don't I consider him a has been to some extent never was and he was a better ex president than the president so yeah I see what you're saying and I I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie thank you very much for that Pam in Sioux City Iowa good evening them\nHey I just say hey listen show all the time on my way home from work and my car I actually calling you from my car that I think a west and that's how they slashed AL and I'm an independent\nAnd I am not a Republican and I am an end and and I think I don't think it's that they want to they're trying to tell people what to do I think their point if they have millions of followers\nAnd they kept quiet here let their followers now how they feel I don't think they're trying to tell them how to how much I just think that they just again just half a million followers\nOh they do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is merely the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well formed an opinion based on what some celebrities says that's the part with which I differ or that they both have the right to speak out oh without question without quest are great\nGreat great but I it again and like I said I like I I really respect your show a lot and again I think that I think I guess trying to reach all their followers and it's just trying to get the vote out there now\nThat that ... in which case ... together because as I say I firmly believe that each of them probably injured their career to a certain extent so if in fact it was that al ... a boy when you take a hit you in your career for something you believe in the well that's that's worthy of applause Richard in Durham North Carolina\nNow Hi hey Jim how you doing I'm well thank you\nI'm a on my way home also more not listen to you on a regular basis and appreciate your show by a bully I've always said this to my wife that\nI Believe that um celebrity have a certain responsibility when they get to a certain point of saying it is their thing\nTo get into politics that's one thing or they are actually active in politics when you have so many years today that\nAbsolutely do not know what's going on and they add allies each table and if they believe that\nTheir idols want them to vote a certain way that's the way they should go not knowing what the consequences are still that that's the wrong way to use your say\nYeah I I again uh I I think what they have to say and how they say it's both both does a couch a very much uh so I see what you're saying it and that would be

bit about it and just for we can expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control Dr Lisa gross cough a metro scarf uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say uh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it's going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states on flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming season it's going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it's going to be\nExactly and for those who say well I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty third team there is something they need to realize and that is a a flu viruses are very sneaky thing that keeps changing honest\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change and flu viruses change constantly um and that's one of the reasons that in most seasoned as we move from one season and to the next to vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be\nThe thing that we are going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year [noise]\nLet's look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nHe has so last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's your seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand that\nUm we had one hundred and eighty recorded so far a pediatric that's from last season and one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um\nThe activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did\nEffected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um all of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're gonna see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have debts and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um\nThose under five years of age particularly under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nUm all that said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young\nAdults can get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this here on the two basic types if you\nWant to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine\nShots are given with a needle generally and they are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been activated and killed so it can cause disease and then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't\nMultiply enough to cause any disease\nBecause most of us are not at all confident to make that choice ah [noise] ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm One of the\nMany things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another\nFor the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what that means they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can take against fluid is the blood every year we were told you sure do always wash your hands a lot\nWell CDC recommends a sort of a three part strategy for preventing flu and also severe illness from flu and one of those things is to um get vaccinated every year if you're within the age group that's recommended\nI'm the second and and this is one that can help not just with flu but with a lot of the other respiratory viruses that circulate around the same time flew does um that's a\nEveryday preventive strategy is things like avoiding contact with sick people washing hands covering cops if you get sick yourself I'm avoiding contact where you can spread of germs to other people those can help again not just with flu but with other respiratory viruses and finally um\nIf you do get flu and your doctor prescribes flu antiviral medicines take those medicines\n\nRed Sox won another world series Boston down the Dodgers five one in Los Angeles to complete a five game world series win over the Dodgers ...

George Soros\nAnything again you know that ...\nThat I agree with you hear a fake trials and you know he had these rallies take a lot I hear a lot of ...\nUh I don't know like throughout the rest is history to hear a sport it is they only had early elections\nThere's been no civility here and there was no way before we start that this is going on\nIn even scarier than news throws a ... ... email us ... if not all that and easy to Haiti or is it\nA car down or fall off the interest if anybody else out throughout the early ... there are always voted places that I tell you it it's pretty nasty there\nBut when you say when you say pretty nasty there are sort of you are you're talking about an actual polling place is that right\nHere you know you've got one side on one side and the other side and then the other side and you know ... at the other\nAnd talking about people who are effectively although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning with so many feet of a bowling side\nIt's like a hundred feet that thought what was happening if it wasn't as it was it's only three mean at the other people that day or I guess\nThat it was it with a different party at the different parties were actually at one that's out there in some cases party for at one another so even when they heard the falling on\nIt I think kids hey there and it'd be interesting is what happened and why is that the Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was Harris\nYeah well again I I'm\nA ... in other words you have in in the in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the uh the office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot\nBut I I don't think a lot of places that you actually have\nHave a normal polling places like\nFire houses in in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mail box if you sit in an absentee ballot or or or protest in the offices of let's say a a cow the a\nOf a county office building so these are actual polling places huh well\nYes well what they call it in the early ... anything that both his early ... gets\nBad after a certain state they have to go to David Crane thing just out of course you can see the apple two thousand but he is I Would say that one\nThe story broke get by with they're not doing that that is the the assets that ... I Believe that aired at thirtieth warning that wasn't that I feel like a fall out later that after that it occurred\nOf data that same on really ever not war\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering do you have anything to ah to say in regard to the specific topic of the arrest of the suspect in the uh the uh the only bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is at this stage\nThe Clinton Wyoming today at black people in this state it's fantastic ongoing arrest record in healthy people that it's in a restaurant for twenty five thirty than out on the street I guess that's the thing that for like ...\n[noise] uh yes it replaces me as well of course\n[noise] uh yes it ... me as well of course obviously you can be arrested to many many many times\nAnd convictions or or what would matter in terms of uh of any of what amounts to prior restraint but I see what you're saying and yes obviously something needs to be done in the in this regard I Would thoroughly concur Oleg ... calls in from Philadelphia tonight they're good evening\n[noise] yeah and what's on your mind to hire so I'm fine I'm I\nWas I got up on what you're saying where I have a lot and you know or something like that so many chances I was also looking at it from that angle where we have a problem with the healthcare system around the country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think the field of mental health\nIt's even more under served radicals that are all and so maybe after somebody goes that and some times yeah they bought the offer of Asian but people are oh\nMaybe they could have a thing where they put people on mental probation where they they are a specialized health professional\nAnd health and maybe if\nI got I think what's more acceptable at first place that person would never get to that place in our minds they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money the professionals are expensive that's part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI investigation that the financial part of it on the other side\nAs a mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent things from happening in the first place\nThat's just priceless especially after yeah especially somebody could be better building bombs and they\nI Would I say get lucky they\nAlso go undetected something actually happens and people get hurt as for something like that with a little bit of and that's something I see is priceless\nWell somebody that I Would agree that certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be so proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health to the science down to ... to such that we can offer treatment of give but let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that we've a fixture you're a defect your brain but a yes or the short answer is we do need more resources in terms of mental health and maybe some kind of a\nIf you will mental health probation might be at least something worth pursuing Greg in Sioux City Iowa on the jumbo having show on the arrest of a suspect in the uh\nSort of bombing case again since he has told authorities that they were never supposed to go off so what's your columns things I don't know go ahead Greg\nYeah tell me that there is about as a as believable as the ... this thing that has been and why did they set up for this guy from day one\nThe whole thing is that is to try to ah bring Cynthia and support for the for the Democrats older really hold there was one of the targets I could have latest ... six years ago\nThat sets it so much BS unbelievable\nWhat I Want to hold her was granted he tended to pick a has been or never was targets that's very true but there is a I I'm not sure why when you say a set up I mean it sounds like the guy said at\nJim Jim this okay how do you know he was at a quote set up and by whom and that's what I thought\nOh my goodness oh lord that the CIA who did that\nYou're saying you're saying that you have knowledge that in fact the Democratic party establishment a hired to seize are say look\nI Will not put it past that I Will not I would not\nWell okay so it's a lot of you know that at all it's the case of you know I asked bill\nBut I I like it I Believe at this point it is so phoney and it's so unbelievable that that are like why don't we just put a like a ... he asked me a thing on the outside say bomb inside it was so unbelievable from the start that this whole thing and it just\nIrrational buys this maybe they would have made it more believable for you either do more to come one eight six six five oh jumbo we'll be back in just a moment\nThis big five or

devices which were delivered this past week to CNN two former presidents and others\nFBI Director Chris Wray of course has announced that arrest in the case then the other suspect as we know is fifty six year old Caesar say are the rest of the Florida and charged with five different federal crimes that could add up to forty eight years in prison\nRe made it clear that the devices in the packages were real and dangerous\nThirteen IDs for Santa various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clocks a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet an energy reaction to heat shock or friction\nNow we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nRe also awards that there could still be other such packages out there and there does anyone want information to contact the FBI again as we know disease are say art has told investigators that\nThe uh of devices would not have heard anyone and that he did not wish to hurt anyone whether or not he had anything else to say about why he went to all this trouble to do this is not clear a lead in Champaign, Illinois joins us on the jumbo had a Joe Linda good evening\nAnd and I could say a lot of things and I I cried when I first heard this today I just decided to let it sit there and look at it for a while I'll think about you know wait until\nSomething started falling into place but I I'm just gonna ask pose that question and I can't answer this question actually 'cause I Can't see that other people could look and see pictures of him at Trump rallies number one ... what are they like photo shop\nMember and number two and a lot of people have said he had this van in Broward County\nAnd they they said even if you're in if you're in Broward County in the pace of people even if you want sticker on a vehicle you're going to get ... you're going to have your your vehicle attack scratched whatever it's going to be\nAnd these people are going to go after it and that Dana let you know like it was you know not attacked or nothing with that in ...\nAnd so I'm kind of interesting observation is out\nThere are pictures out there that the show him apparently at the at the Trump rallies although I Would agree that\nThat certainly this was the day and age when with bumper stickers are virtually any kind of a can can get your uh your uh your car uh vandalize the interview the ... says you're a member of the Rotary Club it would seem to this day and age of the big bucks to set off some people out there\nAnd then ... year old Broward County ... car is covered when and I'm kind of stuff and all kinds of stuff and it's just it's it's just curious and um there are a lot of curious thing about it that way you look at it so I just thought that I just think about those things\nWell I think those reports certainly to do worse the worth considering Lyndon I thank you for sharing that with us tonight when eight six six five oh jumbo Standley in Raleigh North Carolina Good evening Stanley\n... thank you for taking my call why your question I have no doubt that a ... up to date on this story as you are do I read as much from the secret service reports yeah we are records as you've been available\nSeveral times in the last Fifteen minutes you've made the comment that apparently this gentleman is not capable or was not capable of taking care of his own affairs a nowhere have I read that he was not capable of taking care of it on a fair so where where did you claim that Trump\nI get that from the all the various arrests that were made this man and the various activities threatening to bomb a power plant at one point or\nOther brushes with the law I mean it is abundantly clear to me whether or not you have a basis they're under the law for some kind of a of the preventive activities or something else again but I'd say his his record speaks for itself\nOr certainly but there are many people have been arrested who has a criminal histories pay their bills are that are able\nTo share them so they're not the fares are speaking of I I'm happy if he was able to pay his bills I'm Talking about able to manage his own affairs without interfering with others let's put it that way\nOkay All right well that makes it clear I Do appreciate your time is a great show\nOkay All right with that that makes it clear I Do appreciate your time is a great show as usual much\nThanks very much that we appreciate that one eight six six five oh jumbo at age six six five oh five four six to six ah Scott calls them from Utica New York Good evening Scott\n... um I just wanted to say real quick I Try to China and um you know first of all the Democrats and Republicans um there's you know saying you know there's no way around and I think that that uh uh more or less true um\nAnd uh you know I think that that guy for like ... people back into history to fish and a lot of different aspects of Mark Dayton the chat line or that and the kids from Columbine and Charles in ... school shooters it seems an easier isolating people\nA very ... people that are are they in franchise\nWill know who they say that they call themselves disenfranchised there was nothing about this man was disenfranchise\nWell I I\nWhat I really mean is I think that what I was trying to say is they feel as though they're not ... Indian and anger and also a need to strike I mean this guy Adams and like a circus away get Liza rats do we haven't\nSet any sign that one other thing I just wanted to say really quickly I remember\nA like an arsonist that will set a fire and that is standing there and watch the chaos ensues also a\nLot of the problem too is every time you hear about someone while they more or less stayed under the age time that they that Iraq is getting toward the Y. or\nThey these criminals and they say well he's got a very long wrap sheet and you wonder why they're still running around and one more quick point is I may I remember watching the ... I Know this is gonna sound funny but\nI remember watching Batman and Batman was trying to figure out why in joker was doing what he was doing and how far in central woman his father Albert and censor\nThere are some people in this world that there is no rhyme or reason they just want to watch the world and Bertie\nShadi area you can't figure it out you know you just don't know what kinds of things people are sitting there by themselves and we went over the stress and anger that they come up wish to do\nOr is it that\nYou accept the fact that some people are out there I Do not accept the fact that we allow them to go beyond certain limits and to but I certainly agree with the central point Scott thank you very much we back with more in a moment\nIs by E R s St Louis yesterday here who are\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard came to\nThe baseball season is over the\nBoston Red Sox or World Series champions there five to one when at Los Angeles closes out the Dodgers and five games with this year's fall classic\nDodgers are now in record territory a record they don't want only one other team has lost to back to back World Series on home turf he was in Nineteen thirty six thirty seven New York giants at the polo grounds now you can add the twenty Seventeen and twenty Eighteen LA Dodgers to that\nAfter losing the Houston last year and now the Boston ABC's\nAlex Stone at Dodger Stadium in Indonesia a search and rescue effort is under way but there's been no word yet of survivors from the crash of lion air flight J.

earlier on the program but put it is not really a caravan of it is a mob additives that tried to invade the country\nWhere to gauge did a a great national argument that really hasn't changed that much I suppose over the years it is the whole question of whether we are in fact a sovereign nation whether in fact sovereign nations are a good idea [noise]\nAnd uh so goes the theory of those who feel otherwise that the sovereign nations equal hatred that nationalism automatically equals tribalism and I would counter that by noting\nThat there is no one world we do not all hold hands we do not all sing ... we did not have column heritage is or beliefs or ethics\nWe uh existed a world in which there are substantial numbers of people who believe that women should be property that buying and selling slaves is not that bad a deal\nThat uh if you leave a certain religious faith that I Am speaking about Islam that it is okay for had that they have that person but to death and that's a significant viewpoint and such relatively modern it Islamic countries as say Egypt for example\nWe do not all have one view of this world will we ever will ever is a long time a lot of the lifetime of just about anybody listening right now I'm not I suspect of the lifetime of anybody who was alive at this particular time\nThe idea here is not that nationalism is good or bad\nNationalism is the only alternative to anarchy\nThere is no world community or anything else that they're remotely smacks with some of the utopian nonsense that his pedaled out there as a plausible and possible policy options they they don't\nExist as policy options for better or for worse and I frankly feel that at this time in our world development of this for better we are a world of nation states\nAnd it is best to work within the framework of that which does work at which is accepted and are\nThere you have of the nation state as such exists to a great extent of based on its ability to define just where

you could take an asylum that we need to stop them before they enter our ...\nIf you do to stop it before they head or you can forget about it because uh they're they're God they've uh they've disappeared at that point so yes we do have to do that literally voice well taken given thank you for sharing Charlie and Manhattan, Kansas ... good evening Charlie\nCredited with you know\nI\nHad worked on your life denied Charlie\nFair share my grandfather came came to this country Nineteen or ... they came through Ellis Island yeah and you know we were up there I got the documentation of his ... and\nYou had to have money to get in the United states and if he didn't they set you back on the boat and if you are sick they set you back or what do these people coming up through the other way they they check but they're going to check their uh\nTheir physical danger or are they going to be sick or what\nWell they certainly need to be vetted at a variety of ways\nI mean they don't have any any right to come up here I mean we got this issue about him and to sign that says you know\nIt's true you're right thing to do by letting a man if you don't command you can get excommunicated from the Catholic Church that's absolutely ridiculous where the Catholic Church that at all these other problems and they got you got to finish up talking about this\nSo well that vision of the point of view and fifty cents as far as I'm concerned will get you a cup of coffee you have a parade would have to be by attitude to take his views of what is there is not right and the stick them so thanks

people came into the country the right way\nThrough Ellis Island you know through the right process [noise] I don't understand and I am a Marine Corps war veteran and I've been to some of these countries\nI don't understand why Mexico is not doing anything they're letting them come through that show and we deal with it and they don't have to\nThat's right but uh they're they're doing it because it's to their advantage and that's why they have always until now suddenly had a very tough southern border with Guatemala their northern border they've always looked upon as essentially a toilet to flush the era of employment and other problems on to the United states\nThe editor medical or absolutely and\nI I I'm forty nine years old I Am a war veteran and I voted for the first time for a president that slashed election and I am a Trump supporter and I believe what he has planned on putting our military on the line to stop them is absolutely correct I I I don't see how there's an argument for that\n[noise] oh uh there there's no no rational argument you'll get all kinds of people who get hot and bothered about the fact that we're not being generous enough so is that there's been for me to hear all the people out there who were so generous with the your dollars in my dollars\nTo feel morally superior so thank you for your service DJ and for your good thoughts David in

apparent murder or on the Saudi Government territory a council edge of a a dissident journalist although I gather he himself was not exactly the the voice of freedom that has been made out to be but nonetheless it would appear\nFrom all the divers ... rather a high handed a outright a hit job took place in this case we I don't think most people have really any illusions about the Saudis there\nA dark ages a fascist state but they also come in handy on occasion and so let me ask you are in the world of real politic just\nHow much gossip can we take from them before we start drawing lines that we really mean\nWell I don't think we need to take any more or certainly the murder of the sky show he hardly which obviously the and the Saudis and they can\nTalk about what we did and whether they were under orders or not\nThe real question is well simple number one are we going to put sanctions on them\nWere already started I think this afternoon the surgeries they said that that we're going to put some restrictions and other possible sanctions on that people would accuse of being involved in the murder of your other question really comes down to what else to go to\nAre they going to be sanctions on the royal family on the government itself\nAnd quite frankly I just want to read from the Saudi oil is a crowded race about it and sell them or is he going to live there much longer than they do have a way of dealing with things so extreme prejudice oh\nYeah don't they do when we come back we will pick Jed bad but his brain about something else that's been very much of the headlines

things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI investigation that the financial part of it and then the other side\nOf mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent that kind of thing from happening on the first place that's just slice less especially if the you know especially somebody could do better buildings bombs and they got lucky they get\nThe opposite go undetected something actually happens people get the answer for that something like that with a little bit of an aspect is that something I see is priceless\nWell widely anybody that I Would agree

story Lawrence but thank you for sharing a I Would have to take a look at how you came across this story a Jason\n[noise] church so fucking about surveillance and wiretapping and sort of American attitudes about all of that I'm In twenty twenty Thirteen I was reading about the Edward Snowden's leaks ah you know the story and he revealed that the national Security Agency was gathering\nA ...

know there's a ... bus William Freedman head outside of the auditorium there's named in his honor and so he's he's considered to be the man but in reading about William\nA who was a code breaker famous code breaker I saw that his wife Elizabeth was off the hook brick here that's interesting right how ... how many husband their life cycle breaking team can possibly be [noise]\nAh and so I started looking for more information on that [noise]\nUm and there wasn't really that much out there but I did find a a a link to a library in Virginia [noise] private library that that happened to have twenty two boxes of letters and other materials that she had lost their before she died in Nineteen eighty one day I just decided to drive down I live in Philadelphia\nThat drove down to the

I\nGoing to offer and what you're saying where on the laws and you know a person can only got so many chances I was also looking at it from my my act and go where we have a problem with the healthcare

national security strategist one of America's most trusted authorities on national security strategy and counter terrorism\nA former deputy assistant to the president here's lectured for us special operations command the FBI counter terrorism division and the Green Berets he is briefed among others the CIA the defense intelligence agency and the national Intelligence Council\nHis previous book is defeating jihad the winnable war and a\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nDr ... you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of radiology objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend the wild that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling you call this in the cabinet or hearing the Democrats said at the starting with Cory Booker to use the phrase\nThe truth when talking about that testimony from Dr fold so telling the truth\nIs no such thing as truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what you get this is posed motives and this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics to be divided into two groups and those who believe there is ...\nAnd those that believe everything is relative but those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twenty twenty first century\nWhat if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states\nI mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction but what I just said I wouldn't subscribe do but how would a believer in subject the truth telling me that my subjective truth\nWas wrong with theirs is right\n... yeah that that may have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truthful multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically\nTo deny your accusations so this is this is the absurdity of of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon\nThat you can use against the the liberals spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam has a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean there's the theories as the theology and then there's the ... so the question is what what is the practice if\nIf it's a Muslim who's living in America a band or behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\nWhere it's all um become lose the legal system we're sure real law actually becomes the ... of the land ... than we have a problem because then the the truth is that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so\nYou know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies that is a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country than who we are actually talk about\nOne thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today\nHope you about one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left\nUh pushing harder and harder to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go or do you think that they've overstretched overreached I should say it in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\nYes they're very good question I just uh the ... in the upcoming Mitt to lose\n... the ... the Democrat Party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist a at a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of\nAmerican millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the may was socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party overall the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party\nHave managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two

eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly his latest in the killing series killing the ss\nCo written with Martin do guard is already working its way up to the top of the best seller lists and there were going to look a bit of just what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is ... you look at the title just say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until ah killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government [noise]\nSure um after Iraq killing Patton which I became an enormous salary at a lot of material left over because pat and\nWas an occupier in southern Germany before he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat and and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we got to use these captured Nazis\nTo spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember him from killing hadn't had one actually fight them he wanted to fight style and so that's what the new CIA or that took over from the judge did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and gift shop all people\nTo spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union and they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most of our human beings have it off the planet\nCalled Odessa and family knew about a year a before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose\nUh before the third Reich collapse of\nGermany was going to lose him with all he can negotiate except for peace is kind of crazy delusional stuff from him what he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they help these guys get outta Germany and we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the American not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland help them a elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to a general way Italy and on boats to Spain and South America and South Africa\nOr if it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took him big guys and we took it Eichmann andme Angola Klaus Barbie the Bush early on Martin Mormon\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we prove that in the book by dental work so compelling compelling a story almost on every page [noise]\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim ... the ... ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nDuring World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the ... go on a cap\nAnd ... and ran a concentration camps where they killed millions of people who just ordinary people\nAre just amazing I'm ... and when you read it if the people that couldn't happen yeah it it it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise in your eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand that the motivation [noise]\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two uh certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind\nOf justification for whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify what this country and others the Vatican another's did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil [laughter] that's what Harry Truman did ill and killing the ss we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male\nTo go after Adolf Eichmann and they had to say if you don't Mr President we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that thing\nThat forced force Truman to do it\nWho who who blackmail on it who blackmailed him\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear that we named the man that I have two men didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge or an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened to the concentration camps\nAnd an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people knew it\nBut he couldn't salad or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about them or just a a a a tidbit if you will of some orders for thought from his latest of the killing series\nKilling the ss and it is a a gang busters ... just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again our number one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six would be like to talk to bill about\nHis book killing BSS

mother and father\nAnd this guy writing for cold there who's still working at Kobe or to no action against it is is applauding the fact that we ruined his life like that's a good thing and I think Americans have picking that up\nPicking up that this progressive left movement and teeth are these people they're dangerous\nAnd and there's nothing in the world more tragic ironic\nThat people are calling themselves at an anti fascist who's tactics would be recognized by any member of the brown shirts the Nazi movement I mean they called themselves anti fascist is just tragic ironic at and sadly most of them would not even understand the irony\nYeah the good news is the good news is that there's not many of them\nThe the bad news is is that they're identical to the S. A. in Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boy so went out and beat up everybody that oppose Nazi isn't\nIt's the same tactics or like the same same thing but in America a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\nA lot of them do yeah yeah\nI'll take a quick break come back with more from Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S.

tower one of the original letter but his compatriots with the letter than these days [laughter] gotta G A Bobby pointed out have only been with the group well over Thirty years so their relative newcomers\nThis new CD we should tell you is called by request skin has some wonderful selections on it\nAnd what a number of album is this I Know you've just done so many yet Tony Abbott how many does this make\n... is our seventies total turtle sounds recorded in the last ... years we gr record the eight hundred plus sounds\nUnbelievable ... and over the years just go ahead hitting this was some statistics of of record sales and a and top hits and the like because the the numbers for the Letterman are extremely impressive Tony\nLee yeah thanks for bringing that up because you know we have quite a kind of quiet career compared to a lot of the groups seagulls just British in Beijing music and the beach boys with the surfing in hot rod music well we didn't get all the notoriety 'cause we never get drugs and we never were that\nAll his you'd never got in trouble but never a political we never got to juggle the\nWater's weirdest three squeaky clean boys from next door that happened to go out there do good show so a precedent media it was only\n... foot stories out about that boy so we were kind of under the radar all these years and I I Try to like it that way because we never uh we we talked with some of the\nBiggest entertainers we were just a Jack Benny we took the Jack Benny toward with George Burns we toured with Mitch Skelton as well as doing a lot of his supporters and special and\nJackie Gleason dean Martin the Jerry Lewis we were in that realm we were kids doing rock and roll a being that boy so I I like the fact that we had a clean cut career and uh it was still very healthy it's still around to this day\nWell it certainly is it didn't just burn across the sky like a shooting star the letter been have had to stay in power and I was amazed to discover this but in fact it is next year but not until next year\nThat the Letterman will finally get what they have so long deserved and that is a star of a Hollywood walk of fame you must be very proud\n... oh my gosh you know for sure if that's a great ...\n... oh my gosh you know for sure if that's a very big but it's in the in our little a bit of that it's a very prestigious thing to have millions of people visit Hollywood and millions of people take photos city on the star of the\nFavorite entertainer than the Hollywood Boulevard so it's it's\nWe have we are very very proud of it that the cheating that\nWell you certainly should be now I have to look at at this career this this uh this traveling around the country and the like don't you ever get tired of the tour\nAll the ways that you know I see people on television don't know Carson's show in the David Letterman show and there's the other day talking and they put their hands on that for ... oh my gosh it's so hard and they try to get pity for themselves I think they're trying to get pity for all the millions of dollars they're making\nThat I always say if I'm On the road and getting up some occasionally at six AM after one of the four and catch a flight and you know what I think at the alternative Jim his shirt peach digging ditches\nHuck does that do it it really does now you have such a beautiful pure sound and yet you interact with an audience so well so I'm curious about this you've got the touring the live shows and you've got the recording studio and of course\nUh with the live show or you have that immediate spontaneous reaction but it's it's one take mistakes but all whereas on the recording studio wild granted\nA nobody's cheering but maybe the a and R guy behind the window but but you could do take twenty eight if you need to to get a perfect so I'm curious which do the Letterman prefer the studio perfection or the on the road live spontaneity\nWell you know probably the worst interview or in the world is if you eat in the world because on the very positive guy I don't look to the negative and they make so when it comes to a question like that Mike I answer is I prefer to vote because it does\nIf you're in the studio for months at so and then you're on the road from it gives you that friday of seeing the country she in the world that yet being able to get in there and and just create Kennedy of your with your friends in front of my microphone\nYou guys have anything that approaches oh a a bucket list that you've done so much and you have received these honors an accolades and I'm just wondering is there something out there the letter but I haven't done the oh I don't know like a maybe a a Broadway musical or something I'm just curious\n[noise] yeah you know those are always wonderful thing that was a it would be great to have like the ... of you know four seasons ever we show\nHere of course they were controversial which they were very ... off stage it did some things but [noise] yeah well I'll tell you what Mm not really a gym 'cause she let me tell you one thing back in you know the first man on the moon\nArmstrong John Glen and on and the altar and well yeah a Armstrong his dad was a big fan of the letter and and his wife was a really big fan so when they won\nOr lost to the moon and you're listening to the moon Armstrong did they have this little ... they weren't sure if the chosen to work that they had in their capsule they would choose the music that they wanted the here just in case he got stranded up there for a year in the capsule and they all the bacteria that\nKilled what happened was he chose their heat at four\nLetterman touch with him and when he landed on the moon is spent the time on the moon\nHe left his packet by the U.S flag us flagpole and\nWhen they came back to earth so back in ... what is in Nineteen sixty eight sixty nine one one than the loan or he left a subtle Letterman cuts on the moon so when we were national act where international act and we're also ... intergalactic at\nSo not much more we can accomplish\nI daresay dot and are looking at the at what you have coming up of course you've got the the new CD out now a by requests you've got the Hollywood or a walk of fame anything else that is a new in the life of the Letterman\nWell we just start planning now a tour of Europe you know a lot of it are very very big in the Southeast Asia or the Philippines and Japan Hong Kong Singapore club port your car to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Saint Louis", "day":

a show at one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly his latest in the killing series killing the ss co written with Martin do guard\nIs already working its way up to the top of the best seller lists and there were going to look a bit of just what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is ... you look at the title just say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what it usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until ah killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government [noise]\nSure um after Iraq killing Patton which became an enormous salary a lot of material leftover biggest Patton\nWas an occupier in southern Germany uh before he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat and and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was [noise]\nAnd many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union which is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember him from killing a bad one actually fight them you wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA that took over from the OSX did\nThe enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and get ... people\nTo spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union and they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich Hamel or their head of the ss one of the most of our human beings ever walked the planet\nCalled Odessa and family knew about a year or before the third Reich collapse that Germany was going to lose him with he can negotiate a separate pieces kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they helped these guys get out of Germany we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the America and not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped them a elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to general Italy and on boats to Spain and South America and South Africa [noise]\nAh it it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took a big guys and we took it I man and mangled Klaus Barbie the Bush early on that and more women\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kinda we prove that in the book my dental work [noise] so ... it's a compelling compelling a story almost on every page [noise]\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim ... says people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university [noise]\nAnd you wouldn't World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the ... go on a cap\nAnd ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nWho just ordinary people are just amazing I'm ... and when you read it if people to all that couldn't happen yeah it it it it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation\n[noise] but I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two and certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth that is there any kind of justification for whatever intelligence these people may have revealed\nTo justify who want to this country and others the Vatican another's did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that's what Harry Truman did hail and killing the assets we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black males\nTo go after it off Eichmann and they had to say if you don't Mr President we're going to leak it to the press that you're not going to go after I who who did that and that and that forced force Truman to do it\nWho who blackmail on it who blackmailed him\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear that\nWe named the man I'm that if Truman didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened to the concentration camps [laughter]\nAn insult true very true and was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people knew it\nBut he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about the uh just a a a a tad bit if you will or some hors d'oeuvres for thought from his latest of

think he was inexcusable I think that one problem I had with it if these women had a problem with judge Kavanaugh [noise]\nWhy didn't they bring up the ... race stories back X number of years ago when

eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly his latest in the killing series killing the ss\nCo written with Martin do guard is already working its way up to the the top of the best seller lists and there were going to look a bit of just what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is ... you look at the titles you'll say oh well I Know\nLike most of the things that bill is tackled you look at the title just say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until ah killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government [noise]\nSure um after Iraq killing Patton which I became an enormous salary and a lot of material leftover biggest pad and [noise]\nUh was an occupier and southern Germany\nUh before he was a killer met his death in a hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat in and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember from killing a bad one actually fight them he wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA that took over from the ... did\nThe day and listen to a lot of these uh ss people and gift shop all people to spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union\nAnd they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich Hamel or that or the ss one of the most vile human beings ever to walk the planet\nCalled Odessa and family knew about a year or before the third Reich collapse that Germany was going to lose him with the way he can negotiate a separate piece is kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization [noise] and so they help these guys get out of Germany and we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened [noise]\nAnd also the America and not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland help them a elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to a general way Italy and on boats to Spain South America and South Africa [noise]\nAh it it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out what took and big guys I went to a guy men andme angle a Klaus Barbie the Bush early on that and more and more men\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we prove that in the book by dental work [noise] so ... it's a compelling compelling a story almost on every page [noise]\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you\nKnow Jim ... these ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university you want to World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the debt said just go on a cap and ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nWould just ordinary people are just amazing I'm ... and when you read it if the people that couldn't happen yeah it it it it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here at the moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation [noise]\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two uh certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification for whatever intelligence these people may have revealed\nTo justify what this country and others the Vatican another's did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that's what Harry Truman did hail and killing the ss we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black males\nTo go after it off Eichmann it they had to say if you don't Mr President and we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that and that that forced forced Truman to do it who who who blackmail on it who black males and\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear and we named the man I'm that after two men didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened to the concentration camps\nAnd an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people he knew it\nBut he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about the uh just a a a a tad bit if you will lessen hors d'oeuvres for thought from his latest of the killing series\nKilling the ss and uh it is a gang buster read to just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again our number one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six if you'd like to talk to bill about\nHis book killing the ss or any of the big issues of the day and of course we haven't even talked about the mid term

the s._s. no Internet or do you did in five ... sorry [laughter] I'm Sorry\nI'm you know look at these guys [noise]\nThat were involved with the extermination\nOf more than six million I mean they say six million but if you really added up to how many people died after the fact in the end of a deprivation because their families where\nYou know they died of broken heart some of them is they [noise] they for pets you waited and evil let's really never been seen before in modern times I mean you have to go back to a pill a and Jane gifts con and these people um to to see\nHow badly this evil um took root\nAnd eventually killed more than fifty million in Europe alone\nAnd and so when the war was over the prevailing sense was relieved [laughter]\nWe're ... which it's over and we don't want to relive it even the Nuremberg trials and and the um the action that was taken a lot of people turned away they just didn't want to hear it anymore and a lot of people in Israel did the same thing they didn't want to be reminded of it\nThey didn't want to be reminded of Israeli government [noise] their main thing was protecting themselves against the Arabs they didn't want to put resources into finding Eichmann andme angle they had to be convinced to do it\nBecause they kept saying we don't want to live this it wasn't like the whole nation was demanding that they tracked down I\nAnd and the guys who got away knew that they knew that there was fatigue and even sympathy in some quarters in Europe sympathy so it was my job as a journalist slash historian of cut through all that\nAnd to tell you look and this is what happened and it distracts me that younger Americans at no black includes\nYou know how much they ...\nShould in school it's not discussed\nTo this is what happened and this is evil and the reason it happened is that because most Germans look away\nThat they could have stopped it they chose not to\nCause they looked away [laughter] and here in America we have a rise any evil we people walking into schools gunning down students we have thousands of people being shot in Chicago by drug gangs clerics molesting kids evil\nYes and he's a word that the that needs to be

gentleman that evil sort of regime and they are barbaric against women and all kinds of\nCitizens of their country so that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me that they have generally been\nPretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this uh this kind of arrogance or maybe\nThat's why they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation they were supposed to do everything but ...\nYou know you know the ... that ended up ... this is a regime so brutal that they might very well think that that would somehow pass a oh okay you were only tried to made me a little bit ah maybe that maybe I maybe I'm wrong maybe they are that stupid Linda in champagne Illinois hello\nHi ... I'm not saying that says static government are nice\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that they are\nCertainly not at that and this this fellow um athletes came from a family of arms dealers have within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to some of these\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood supporter he is the other ... that Harvey makes him a savory character that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having the freedom to chat right in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed and now ... says that\nUm [noise] and I honestly think that the government would have been so stupid it's ... like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even know what happened\nYou know we do but but I was thinking about this rogue elements like consulates consulates these are not just places like boutique sort of the shopping center where you just wander end but\nPeople can decide to do something that's\nNot smart and I think that the fellow called in about John granted maybe on something and it meant and then the partly make Trump look bad and and make a ... you know because I\n... that that is the level of Machiavellian thought you'll have to explain to me I don't understand and I certainly make no apologies about John Brennan who's been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody uh on the American left especially given the fact that have been fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on uh everybody on the left in the United states I mean that I don't see any gain here for the risk of\nHabit but I Will say that like before the election this isn't you know causing the administration headache\nWell it's going to be administration a minor league headache I mean let's face it let's just not this was not Iranian nuclear deal is is not a a lot of jobs than anything else I mean that although we're we're making a big deal out of it because people get all upset about it but I cannot believe frankly Linda\nThat the one tenth of one percent of the voters in this country are going to change their vote because of this\nWell I think that the industry is handling it very well but I Do think it's being blown way out of proportion like yeah leave that we've been talking about it for many days out\nOf okay sit me or take\nA really don't have anything to add to that and then\nI just can't wait to find out whatever we can find out about it for ... and then you send going forward in any sort of dealings with any of the parties involved at something we need to know and factor into everything that we do face of the whoever the actors were\nAnd it may be extremely difficult to pin down exactly who ordered this done\nBut you know it was certainly people in the Saudi regime that were high up with the Saudi regime I think the lead person that was sent in to the\nConflict was one of the very closest persons to the king and and to his son\nI mean ... ... again it let's say hang these people out to dry and say that it was it

dialogue to be conducted at that volume\nIs it necessary it certainly is a\nConstructive it certainly isn't logical\nAnd yet there must be some reasons why it is happening well we're joined by

uh we uh we thank you for being with us or to my doctor grade so\nThank you for having me do you have a ... just as an overall explanation before we get into some of the details behind it why we seem to be out of control at this time [noise] uh\nI think it's probably many reasons but the point of the book was really to try to frame the whole political issue in terms of the underlying psychology\nAnd I I think the psychological positions are probably best trade with respect to the concept of religious conflict because I think there are many aspects of what's taking place now that really ...\nUh what goes on between a sectarian groups a religious level\n[noise] uh okay I Am a a a a a religious\nLevel All right uh ... please please amplify further on that are obviously we're not talking about\nUh two different religious sects per se unless you want to uh to consider a I suppose the more traditional a Judeo Christian ethic on the one hand as a religious sect and there's a new identity politics a political correctness\nAnd there's a new\nIdentity politics a political correctness and the like ah as being a mother a religious sect or this is a is grounded in which I'm not a perhaps a totally understanding what you're saying [noise]\nOkay well despite the fact that most of it is similar for probably very few individuals who don't ascribe to some degree of secular already a there are religious underpinnings to a secular thought and they do or fall\nIn line with the Judeo Christian ethic except it's in large measure breakdown of the ... Christian aspect of that\nCan you hear me\nYes you're on the radio go right ahead\nMy phone is I got a flip phone well okay for\nSure I don't consider myself ... fell ... percent but what I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot of it they were talking about George Washington when president he did not want to ... them and I think that I felt\nThat\nYou know if it got people that I don't care who's name it they're whatever letter earning base it on\nAnd that way I see we don't need any cell otherwise\nUp on Capitol Hill so whatever something happened at a port woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that up to me it's not it area the fact that Obama when he killed somebody for the for all we got to wait until after the election\nShow it on the other for for how to get elected\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one note before deferring to Dr Creighton\nIt was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions\nFactions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize\nTo try and convince others of their point of view it as an essential part of society ... be carried do far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that with the notion that you can have a free society without different factions is an impossibility by defer to Dr Creighton\nHas to agree with you entirely about that I think there's a psychological motivation ... leave for\nThe unified groups to ultimately break down into smaller divisions so I I think there's no way of avoiding traction is what you do want to avoid as you mentioned is the extremes polarity between two factions so that there's no workable solution to the system\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but the writing a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\nMartin has always enjoy your show who shake your says thank you when you get sort of point when you go to is\nThe restaurant or do you go out and so on I ... I don't know if the person who the establishment is left ... whatever the or I don't understand this really wants to who\nGets to a point where you can't go out and have reason to say without someone screaming at you spit you lose nothing and send things you can't [noise]\nI really don't care of or his positions\nJust let's say let's have a reason to bake them if we can talk to them screaming at each other for ... which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm I called the Clinton machine Clinton machine has his just use is to give up the fact\nThat two years ago two years ago [noise]\nYou know you lost the election of ... I guess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest [noise] then you're going to try to build it up to tear down\nAgain I'm not sure the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the boats Clinton's especially in regard to a uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a ... across the country\nBut I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nThat is that much of of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves and ... that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course that those tactics of the silencing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts referencing I\nYou shouldn't and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these\nPeople but that is a that is is the sad a problem and that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective that you are so few or that you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else than the only answer in my book\nAnd you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as in my book is do arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that he is out of bounds or you can let society it'd be reduced to ... to the level of but who can put together and more of violence on the street for you know\nI I think you're going to several important points or whatever the points I Try to make in the book has to do again with the underlying psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's ... for some time now that is an increasing degree or\nA ... of the offices within the society and then the increasing decree of moral perfectionism obsession all drinking is society\nAs a result when when one morning count as those types of psychological structuring individuals are those individuals are very prone to what we call projection and that is that they tend to uh take aspects of the the denied a self\nMake up and you place them on people around them\nA certain point you have a group like a ... a\nA claiming that the anti fascist and you look at the after it's very very obvious that that behavior is that if you're one would expect from the fascist group [noise]\nAnd so you see this kind of an accusation coming from the left projecting on the right for everything that they're doing\nA and and denying that are claiming that it's right to just doing it so that I think that motivation for some of this behavior in terms of how to deal with it I I agree with you entirely I think one of the greatest problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs the lack of enforcement of the laws that are ... that are\nCurrently on the books a from a place like a Portland for for the mayor of Portland to sit by and have people rioting on the streets issues have to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the\nNecessary a legal sanctions and boundaries or a free society must have and if that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah again it it it is not something that uh\nThat that could that could possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples of some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought a rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say that if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass are behaving like civilized beings and that is [laughter]\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that as it is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nWho's ... yeah go ahead [noise]\nUh uh yeah absolutely but it it's the role of the week of then ah both at the local level and the federal law ultra forced the laws of the country [noise] and if they fail to do that you can expect a increasing outbursts or for these groups because they're essentially unable to behave badly\nExactly are we are at the G telling them yes you're tactic at intimidation is working and ah people respond\nPositively win or are they are told that ah their tactic\nIs uh is going to be tolerated that stay with us more to come as a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology involved in the the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing

done [noise] also and one might be to significantly limit the number of a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all [laughter]\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here and not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options that we have to make some sort of statement about this [laughter]\nUm but yes I mean I see your point is there's this gym in our talking at the beginning of the show this is an extremely complicated issue there are good and bad nobody to know south herbal the Saudi regime is but it's better than it used to be in some ways\nYes in some ways and better than almost any conceivable alternative on that peninsula Luke in Madison, Wisconsin good evening\nEvening I'm I appreciate\nBoth of your pragmatic approach to the situation but I don't think they should give the higher pass to a group of people that intentionally paralyzed someone and tortured them over seven minutes by all accounts\nFarm not giving mass either I just ... there's not a lot we can do about it\n[noise] and that that is what makes this complicated isn't that the brutality of their act for\nThe parent brutality again what we have so far our stories don't pass it off no no we're just supposed to be clear about this loop we at this juncture did not have a definitive answer on what happened we have what is looking more and more like a probable outcome if that is true then you would be right but we haven't got that\nMany and when you look at the Saudi response where they said we weren't involved and now they say it was a interrogation that went wrong no one gets to be headed during an entirely sure why aggressive as soon as I heard that I thought okay that what that means they tortured him to death\nI thoroughly agree on it have you\nAs a as if this was never happened anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm not going to say what do you do about it do you cut off our nose despite our face\nAt some point when you have people who have sponsored the nine eleven attacks\nBut not wait just a minute or we do not know that the Saudi Government had anything to do with the nine eleven attacks\nHave won't feel the information that the FBI reports that and you know that too but that's neither here nor there no it certainly is when you have a ... when you have a group of people that are basically scaring the world ... act you have to do something [noise] and [noise]\nEven even ... even to the exclusion of our own best interests let's say that al ... to ... this hour in law just finished my state with before we get your answer a let's say al ... took control of the Saudi peninsula how does that improve things either for the people there or to this country\nYou think it's good to have a government that will take someone into a conflict poetry\nObviously not and I repeat my question to you in fact I'm going to pose the question now without interruption and then let you respond to it let's assume\nThat the al ... or ISIS forces took control of the Saudi peninsula every bit as brutalization ... regime maybe more so and very identical to go to the interests of the United states how is that an improvement Luke\nHow is butchering someone that\nKind of obviously you just don't care to deal with reality okay I understand your outrage but like so many people in this country today your outrage does not have any logical conclusion\nThe answer of course the one I pose was it wouldn't be better at it till you come up with some kind of have a better answer other than just were outraged and we're going to do something that will be\nHarmful to the United states and the Saudi people because it'll make us feel better I don't consider that a responsible answer a ... thought for abusive needs to go to the next call here\nYeah we do have to be very practical about it and we have to put the interests of American citizens first both whether they be in the region or in this country right now in our our strategic military interests around the globe and everything else [noise]\nIt'd be a little different if this will be the only time in history that any regime is ever active than a brutal way well guess what it is that I'm so sorry the human condition is as bad as it is but it is and the notion that never happened

call from Charlotte in Durham North Carolina Hello Charlotte and welcome\nThank you very much and I appreciate it real hot ... it's the main has been for many years that failed to comprehend it somebody could enlighten me I Would love to know why in the world\nWe give ... billion dollars every year to the Saudis Christiana poor reportage she went in undercover in several places but uh you know really she could have lost her life that she showed where\nThe Saudis have fourteen carriages go five states in their ... why are we sending money\nOr there's no question about the fact that they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although as I noted the Sydney Powell\nThey may be useful on occasion is hardly a usefulness that would demand or that they get our money that part I must confess or is a is a little hard to understand\nI don't understand it all I Know I have an absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we shouldn't give them down\nAgain as I say uh if uh they were someone useful to us who needed the money that might be different but they are someone who can be useful to his food doesn't need a penny and in that regard I think Charlotte sport is extremely well ticket\nA one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six Rick in Tucson now and the good evening Rick\nJim of just calling to ah suggest ah I'm trying to find out of the reason why the ... um wouldn't just when they've got this guy on the consulate\nWouldn't just for ... for a certain level in there or did you do show\nA U.S that he's violated multiple Saudi law was captured item back to Saudi Arabia goes into a jail in Saudi Arabia and his story on a stick in the New York times [noise]\nAgain he would be just as out of the way at the end I think that again we have a a very rational thought process for Rick uh uh get it and less and less we really think certainly power that the Saudis deliberately felt that only\nThrough a show of extreme brutality or could they send their message out I mean I Would think the what Rick just described would even the self be shall we say I'm a plus the buffet to send a message to dissidents\nWell it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier gentleman that evil sort of regime and they are barbaric against women and all kinds of\nAnd they are barbaric against women and all kinds of\nCitizens of their country so that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that the I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me\nThat they have generally been pretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this this kind of arrogance uh maybe\nThat's why they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation they were supposed to do everything but ...\nYou know you know the ... that ended up ... this is a regime so brutal that they might very well I think that that would somehow pass okay you were already tried to make me a little bit ah maybe that maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe they are that's stupid Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that they are\nCertainly not at that and this this fellow um I Believe came from a family of arms dealers heat within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to some of these\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood support or he is a sort of that hardly makes him a savory character that's very true in\nLike the journalists in in Saudi Arabia having the freedom to chat right in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed and everything ... says that\nUm [noise] can I honestly think that the government would if then so stiff as kids pull a stent like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even really what happened\nYou know we do but but I was thinking about this rogue elements in a consulate ... these are not just to places like boutiques the shopping center where you just wander in\nThat people can decide to do something that's\nNot smart and I think that the fellow called in about John Grant and maybe on something and it meant and partly make Trump look bad and try and make a ... you know because I\n... that that is the level of Machiavellian you'll have to explain to me I don't understand and I certainly make no apologies about John Brennan who's been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody uh on the American left especially given the fact that have been fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on the everybody on the left in the United states I mean I don't see any game for the risk of\nA habit but I'm saying that it like before the election this isn't you know causing the administration huge headache\nWell it's going to be administration a minor league headache I mean let's face it off and this is not this was not the Iranian nuclear deal is just not a a jobs than anything else I mean that although we're we're making a big deal out of it because people get all upset about it but I cannot believe frankly Linda [noise] that ah\nThat one tenth of one percent of the voters in this country are going to change their vote because of this\nWell I ... I think that the industry is handling it very well but I Do think it's being blown way out of proportion I Believe that we've been talking about it for many data that we met a okay\nSit me or take\nA really don't have anything to add to that\nI Can't wait to find out whatever we can find out about it for our own edifice occasion and use and going forward in any sort of dealings with any of the parties involved at something we need to know and factor into everything that we do face of the whoever the actors were\nAnd it may be extremely difficult to pin down exactly who ordered this done but you know it was certainly people in the Saudi regime that were high up with the Saudi regime I think the lead person that was sent in to the\nConflict was one of the very closest persons to the king
