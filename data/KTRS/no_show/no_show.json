through ... through a for for three and a half hours on Saturday I Want us to do our part to make sure that everybody comes back for the opportunity to have to be back on campus for homecoming for they see for those who are enough hours have great experience farther\nAdditional things responsibilities to come other than winning the football game other responsibilities because its own company that come to your football team deserves\nThere's been some activities on campus our guys are taking part with I think it's important to do for you look at a student athlete experience and this is one thing that they will always remember when they leave outta here um is is what took place this week\nAlso their focus has been on plan our best on Saturday\nHow's the we're we're going so far it's been awesome we had a great a Tuesday Wednesday Thursday practice uh probably one of our best Thursday's that we've had all year which is good and and we've talked all the time about\nHow your practice habits lead to your game day executions and I'm sure we'll cut loose and play on Saturday a move the way that we practiced for going to have an opportunity to play one of our best\nGame she knows Thurgood stickers you change jobs with less three if you noticed doing anything over the course of the last three weeks in practice there would be concerned in terms of their approach each and every day you\nAlways look at a red flag so to speak and the things that we're cautious of 'em at this point after the losing end of the last week and then a close one of the week before\nA you want to make sure that their confidence as where where it needs to be enough confidence to prepare the right way and you put in the work then and then you have the ability to go play the way you need to and and our\nGuys are ready to go back to the gym you lose thirty nine to ten in that game it hit you with what I thought were a couple of hamburgers early as they say they hit too\nLong touchdown pass on the second player from scrimmage then they get the interception returned to set up a field goal thought Ben at that point in time you're seem really settled in and kind of played played really good football during the second quarter you get a nice touch in a bathroom through rockets Thirteen to tend\nThe ... those those are have makers they hurt to add to the got one on arrival in on the left foot our guys continue to fight and bottle and then show some resolve\nA view this this is the best team up seeing ever um and for them to start out that way with to give up a big play that that's the recipe for free you're ... and I'm\nLike oh throughout the course of the game of the defense ended up and continue to play really hard and they got into it and some adverse situations we held on the field goals and then one or two of those and that is good but also you know the the margin of error when you turn them all over you know they're going to usually capitalize on it and then they did\nYou and I talked about this before the game jewels tell good today are\nExploiting every mistake you make throughout the course of the game\nWhen when you got players all over the field or like they do and every every position I'm usually if if you're you're misplaced missteps eyes on the wrong spot they're gonna they're gonna take advantage of it and then that's what great team and that's what they did and\nAnd we're not to that level yet we're going to get there were not there yet and um I I've seen some things out of out of our team and um [noise] we're still not that far off and then we got a chance to go for it on Saturday\nLet's turn to a bit of both from an officer standpoint just just a thought on the execution on Saturday just news over all read from your viewpoint on\nThe line of scrimmage was first time really that we didn't have the same success so we we did at times run the football okay um we also\nBecause of some some things within the game\nWe didn't have any any success for the vertical passing game and there's a number of reasons for that but um we've got to have the ability and then the third down and then you extend the dries up because I think\nMore than anything we're a pretty good football team with her off into our will on the field and we can drive that there were not always going to get a big play that's not always going to happen but we got enough makers around with experience to that we can go on at ten to twelve to Fifteen play dry the turmoil at points we've got to do that every time you got to\nFigure out a way to to try to get back into the vertical passing them to\nGet there I think there's some things that we continue to work on 'em so excited about some of the things that we have in store this week's it will will bring some of that back\nAnd uh drew is is really comfortable with what we've got a game plan was going in and he's had a great week [laughter]\nAnd it's not only how much even encountered protect it's also the receivers evening where they need to get ... says these back and get on top and then they need to get a cushion there and uh all of it plays together but I I like where we are on a on a Thursday night getting ready for Saturday to have\nThat opportunity as you know his his position as the most visible on the field is the one that draws the most attention not only from those on the opposite side of the field in the deepest certainly fans most dancers will evaluate just what you've seen from drew over the course of the last three weeks while\nI'm excited that told us that this the other day and I'm\nHappy that he's our quarterbacks are in um [noise] he's going to lead this team over the course of the next six weeks or days responsible than they used to Hungary to go do that and I look forward to the way that he's going to lead them\nAgain these had a great week I think there's some things that early on a couple of decisions you like to have him back but also zeroing in understanding and learning then I think if you ask and and really I have a conversation with him he's a better football player right now that he's ever been in his career fan that's good for us it's\nVery I don't mind my Kelly this is talk talk hurt each week from buffalo wild wings presented by academies fortune outdoors rights do low price everyday don't forget the coming up at the bottom

good for a season they're in practice and might be one\nMaybe why was one of our best practices or just because it was back in there there's a sense of focus in direction on on a very very professional practice practice it was\nYou know I I'm not a construction guy faced in which it appears these guys are are moving\nSeems to be pretty impressive\nFrom the time we started practicing our
