friday they announced that they um had captured the bomber in Florida right and we had talked to a couple of people that in the morning and I asked I think we were talking to the chief of detectives in New York City and we asked him a I said when when do you think you're going to when do you think you're going to get the guy\nAnd he said uh we'll get him soon basically like\nAn hour right yeah yeah we're actually closing and don't go anywhere ... will will get it yeah and\nYou know you just knew and I even think I said at one point when it the first ... the first bomb was Tuesday that they picked from George Soros his house and then they intercepted the bombs on Wednesday from the Clintons and then friday at ten o'clock they caught the guy\nRight and then it was Robert De Niro and has no man right and his running is is that right yeah here's how they did it\nThese guys are good by the way a single fingerprint was taken from the bomb that was sent to representative Maxine Waters\nThat was the key right one fingerprint\nSaid this is we're not talking about a criminal mastermind are we didn't\nWell listen to this okay um all of the devices captured throughout the week were sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia\nOn Thursday they were able to lift the one fingerprint from uh from Maxine Waters officials ran the fingerprints to the national database and it came back the name of this Caesar say Iraq with the name\nThey then were able to locate a possible phone number then went to the courts and got a court order applies a warrant if you will\nA that allowed them to triangulate his cell phone data to find his location\nAnd on friday morning at whatever was nine thirty ten o'clock they I'm pulled him over in front of an auto zone uh they said that they found fingerprints and a possible DNA connection on two of the Thirteen devices\nYeah they said that parents there was so much\nEvidence that they I guess with here between your social media flick printed in the United States Postal service uh and then you've got that the feds working on it from Quantico to Los Angeles and everywhere in between I but I Do think\nI Do think that criminals are getting a little less\nMindful is it too many things to keep track of them I don't know he used to just the fingerprints yeah hiding the weapon destroying the weapon destroying the evidence that now and now\nOfficials have a lot more tools and he ... on your cell phone use broken glass and the PVC\nBecause the a bomb maker or so they think want it to ensure that the device was was light as possible to avoid shipping restrictions\nCool how broken glass is a filler is lighter than nails or other metal\nThe postal service requires back just way more than Thirteen ounces to be shipped from the retail counter\n[noise] so um they return heavier packages that are dropped in the mailbox or the slot so he was smart enough to make it lighter than Thirteen ounces so he could drop it off in the mailbox and not have to go to the counter\nAnd I hate to ask this question but you have to today have you also heard the thing about the steroids where he was I mean he he was a male and he was an exotic dancer and he he was dabbled\nIn the mail service because he was sending steroids back and forth\nYou know I wasn't implying that at all I was just saying the the steroid does that make the

honest I'm a little tired but I have this is my favorite part uh when I'm Out every day all day from very early until very late\nI'm at a lot of hot and stranger\nYou know it's it's it's fun because people um you know because of all of a ridiculous television they recognize me and people are still kind of almost a few people that are jerks but [laughter] everybody is very nice it's energizing it's\nSounds like you went to a to a radio conventions most of us are nice but some of us are jerks go over the last Seventy two hours of the country has gone through quite a bit with this bomber and now there's a synagogue in the United States Senate or what are you thinking what are you saying\nI Do think um that we all need to turn the temperature down um and I\nIt has become very very\nTribal and very\nUm you know the rhetoric has gone places and I frankly never expected it to go\nA and some of that starts at the top\nUm and so I\nI think it's really important and and this is self serving and I'm the first acknowledge it that it's really important that we tend to be able to Washington who don't see the other side as the enemy\nUm I work with my Republican colleagues we work across I work right now that's why I get something done because I'm not one of those it just had a knee jerk reaction that if they're in the other party they stink\nI well there are so much stuff we agree on\nWhat gras there's so many things that we can come together on if we can quit tried to demonize\nAnd it's been hard for me in his campaign to get the other side has basically just tried to distort the facts and demonize me\nAnd um I got after Josh highly on what he's done with his job on preexisting condition\nUm I have it certainly I have not done a soul broadside character attack on him like that they have done on me by distorting and lying about my record that these kinds of politics is what's contributing to that and frankly it turns people off people just don't want to get sick of it\nAnd I know people are hungry for us to get together and and unite around things where we can make things better for people and so I Hope people realize that\nI think I can be part of that it failed\nOh people realize that\nI think I can be part of that if they will give me a chance to serve again\nThis election you mentioned is a a lot about pre existing conditions Josh Hawley has said that use in favor of having bridges in conditions covered but it can be done cheaper and less expensive without the Affordable CARE Act what do you\nKnow ... it's a press release um policy it it it does not hold up under scrutiny um if if this were easy don't you think the Republicans would have already done it they preached to repeal and replace for years before they got into power\nThen they got into power and they figure it out it's hard and replace proposal say put I couldn't even get enough Republican votes to pass because they were going to be so harmful to people\nThey were going to be so unpopular much more popular than the CIA so I'm ... and here's the thing about Josh Holly's deal about pre existing conditions he knew when he filed the lawsuit that he was going to wipe out all of the protections that people have\nAnd he knows there is no backup and all people need to realize is when he went to court\nIn September the lawyers asked the judge to not make a decision until after November\nThat tells you pretty much all you need to know that they know if they win in this case that there is no backup\nThere is no safety net and there will be chaos because I'll be a lot of people in Missouri that may not be able to get their insurance policy at the end of the year because we'll be back to the days where insurance companies can say no we're not going to insure you

that's got to be one of the toughest law says I've ever seen a football team give up\nTheir adding up a you know ... fans have a long list a\nTough and uh you know certainly at the kind of when that would really be a feather and burial Tums kept up you know I was one of the few people who are trying to tell people look Kentucky is a good team I'm not just because there are ranked twelve of the country because of how they played this these then the right fit\nYou know we do fans tend to have a perception problem when it comes to Kentucky football\nThey they think Kentucky is just a basketball school they know they beat them when they entered the Congress will they haven't beat them or seen the best Kentucky football team that that the FCC has seen during that time um so uh when it gets conduct you would have been a very big deal the problem in the Kentucky all season\nHas found ways to win games that they don't always do it in a pretty fast and they have a great defense and they are very uh very you know basic often that relies on it's running back\nAnd if he's not playing well and he wasn't on Saturday but they did a great job in the ... now that it's very hard for Kentucky to score but they just find a way and as soon as they turn that on the second half he thought oh no\nThis is a this is bad news from Missouri and they you know they just kind of fell apart and could not find a way to to score points and and this is what happens when you play a winning team they find a way and Missouri unfortunately more times than not by the way to find a way to lose\nI Know a barrier what I'm getting some criticism some of it might be deserve some of its ... ridiculous but the second to last play the one before the pass interference in the end zone where they laid off the receiver and the receiver just tried to get as many yards and then get out of bounds\nOh we're ... we're seeing all the way around could they have done it could have played that any differently\nYeah I mean you can play closer and try to force the guy down inside the you know inside the field of play like lock run there are few calls in decisions made toward the end there that are very confusing um you had you know July not take a second down there would have kept the the clock running you had\nThe decision from Missouri to throw a path on a on a um\nIf you if you have the ability to just ... o'clock in the second half when you're when you're up by a weapon on how you know a ... thing though I mean\nIt's worth mentioning that there was a bogus pass interference call late in the game I mean I think we all five it's all\nIt's easy to watch and even even you know independent observers can say that that was a bad event that pass interference call for the problem is research that I've ever been in that spot in the first place when you're up a weapon on on on our ranked team you have to find ways to put your foot on the road at the Missouri does the opposite of that\nYou know can we even though this pains me to admit it I'm ... with the red Sox winning the world series we have to at least acknowledge that if they're the biggest ones are one of the biggest one when it comes to analytics right so\nAnalytics or here to stay if the team that's heavily invested in it keeps on winning\nThe red Sox are kind of actually a a good example of the boy in um you know they they value every team values analytics and we got we got to be smart about how we talk about this\nThere's not a team in baseball it's not using analytics for some reason analytics has turned into this dirty buzz word of sorts and it's for people who don't have an interest in understanding you know what it's like or what it means and they just want to label it\nBig data analytics and throw it on the least throw it on anything that takes up starting pitcher out of the game too early and they're paid analytics says a lot of stuff analytics is you know how fast the guy runs around the bases analytic split the getting\nDifferent pictures I mean to some degree a batting average which is the most basic outmoded form of factors analytics talking right that this notion that analytics is the best thing we got we got to be better than that just information\nEach team uses it differently each team values that differently something's invest more in it than others the red Sox like anything use it but the Dodgers I guess for you to more the analytics\nNo guru in this in this World Series the red Sox for almost world school on that and that's why you're hearing some of the old school\nFans you know ... holler and beat their chests about an old school team getting down to the reds get the red Sox are not old school two terms or that they're not using\nNumbers and the only using scout every team is using it um the red Sox I think we're a little more traditional and some of their decisions when you saw them keep going back to the David Price will you found them what their picture go later you're gonna see you're in to see the Dodgers get hammered\nSomeday Roberts for for pulling a pitcher early and it blew up on him so he's going to hear that but really the red Sox I think did a good job of\nOf of showing a blend they also did they're also going to be you know the biggest the biggest reason for fans to point to their team and say hey go spend more money because what are the teams that spend a lot of money\nIn the right to work out for them [laughter] I guess the David Price when when it's all said and done I guess it makes sense right or they want a World Series with them so yeah I'm\nActually happy for David Price man he got he got really killed he got killed in Boston a lot you know for his on his struggles he could never beat the Yankees and\nHe got he got posted a pretty good for a lot of the time that he's been there and this is quite a redemption for him\nUm that was pretty cool to see it also kind of cool to see Joe Kelly a former colonel yeah playing a part in that um you know striking on the side in the in a in a huge eighth inning there he had only struck at the side I think one other point in the season\nI'm so it was pretty cool for for him to he picked a good time to have the second one how about David trees in the world series too I mean\nHe's getting older but he doesn't look any older and he's still comes up here to me it was one of the Dodgers best players all throughout the postseason on the team really turned a corner when he joined that so yeah it's pretty impressive to see David Freese still doing David ... the postseason\nYeah All right so the Bryce Harper sweepstakes began a timeline you think we're going to know sooner rather than later\nI think winter meetings will be everything kind of get gets role and big time I don't know if you saw that the word the other day but Scott Boris made a bit of a splash prices agent is super agents got Boris went on an interview with the radio show in New York and told them that it's all wrapped up it's done by those who he wants to play for it\nIt's all but it's all about a matter of time until he announces which would have been a little confusing considering teams aren't even supposed to be able to talk to players go after the world series and\nAnd also Washington gets about that three day window to negotiate with thrown player before he truly becomes a free agent so it was it was back channel after that that's got for us was only joking\nWhen that's not the case but I'm getting the sense that Scott ... is going to enjoy the Bryce Harper free agency socket and maybe have a little fun with this after he took some bumps last year\nYeah well speaking of Scott Boris apparently he has finally secured your deal with the big five fifty K. E. T. R. S.\nUh and so apparently this just coming across the ... will be joining the eyes ups in the afternoon here on the big five fifty gave us is that true\nThat is true and I I think unless unless you have a farm this and I completely understand I think where you and I are going to talk on friday morning now as well but ah I\nEstimate that has to be talked about with your people and my people that maybe will come to some sort of an agreement but some things in the works not to not to get premature news out there too soon\nYeah I Know you're a ten five ... five player so I get to the jak\nAnything management says All right so a guy in the afternoon the more I'm Ben Fred in uh the big sports show at night and or twice a week here in the mornings on the big five fifty ... as a welcome to the welcome I guess to the family full time I guess ... thanks for the Senate\nTo have the hope is to be on the highway patrol itself now I you know I'll leave it to them to make those kind of political decisions but I think I Would much rather have preferred to have kind of up or down vote on policy and a good policy is\nA gas tax that uh reflects a misery priority than folks that money on a roadway themselves as a kind of in a roundabout way but uh it probably is still a worthwhile thing to consider a as we look forward to the future of our roadways here in the state\nPatrick what do you think of the argument that are a lot of uh outside the state of Missouri a truckers\nPeople traveling through right we've we've got all these major interstates people from all over the country when they come through there they're going to buy gas\nAnd so they're going to pick up they're going to pay for the roads they use and so some of this money is going to be coming from Adam states which doesn't necessarily right so so why we don't have to pay it out of state people are paying a portion of the ... what do you think of that side of the ...\nI I think that's probably true um I you know I I'm not inclined to support things like you know hotel taxes for instance our tourism taxes because\nYou know we're we think that other people will pay for things that's not really a great policy in general but the idea that you know people who are from out of town are using our roadways I should probably pay a portion of the car so I think that's fair and I think that the gas tax captors particularly for those who are driving across state not course\nYou can get across the state or on a tank of gas and you know if you're starting in Illinois and you end up in Kansas you may not stop for gas but you know probably is still pretty good that the that you may have stopped some place and if you do stop someplace where gas here in the state\nYou're going to end up paying the gas tax that helps maintain the road so you can keep using them in the future whether or not you're a Missouri rather than\nIt is in terms of the gas tax that part's irrelevant now I think you're right it does capture folks are traveling through the state I think that's a good thing\nYeah what do you what do you think of a well I'll tell you what you know you mentioned tolls ... uh I really come around on told I told the way it's run now you drive through Illinois they'd got souls Chicago's tolls Florida has tolls\nUm it's not in the olden days where you had to sit and wait in the long toll lines and you know wait for the guy to give you change for us for a nickel I'm told what the fast pass and all that it's a great way to pave roads\nYeah I I I agree with that I mean I've I've got a a toll sticker in my cars that drive through Kansas or Oklahoma and I I had one of those turnpike\nIt you don't really have to stop and they end up hurting your your your debit card or credit card or whatever you're you're given them a and I think they made a you know charge yeah once a month or something like that but it really is kind of a no nonsense no problem kind of undertaking then\nSo you know do you want to pay for something that you don't think that you're paying for directly ah you know probably not I I get that but you're still paying for through gas taxes you're paying for it in other ways\nI and particularly if you're not using those turnpike or you're not going to using those toll roads how you'd probably want to folks who are going to use those toll roads to pay for them rather than you have to pay for it for some other tax and stab\nYes ah also all those electric cars that are on the road to right they're not paying the gas tax\n[noise] no but I think this this proposition actually imposes some costs on alternative fuels as well it could be applied similar kind of tax on those but you're exactly right [noise] you know over time Iran figure out ways actually funding these needs and ... and I have gas\nPowered cars have become I guess less frequent er or less kind of the focus of our transportation system will have to look into the future and see exactly how how best to\nA fund our road may be totally will become more popular but uh you know I think the question before it's mostly about gas taxes will turn a fuel and the proposition that you're gonna find out it's going to deal with a little\nBit yeah he was a great point uh you know we were not were might be driving as much as we've never been but with much more fuel efficient cars so are you not buying as much gas meaning the tax has gone down really in the in in real dollars thanks thanks the more fuel efficient cars\nIn your ear exactly and that's kind of problem that we're looking at from a you know the last time that we even increased the the gas tax no Seventeen cents in Nineteen Ninety six robot that for different than Seventeen cents a gallon and twenty Eighteen particularly if\nYou're ... you're able to make thirty mile per gallon rather than you know twenty miles down we I think over time we're gonna have to make different policy adjustments on you know what were the tax is going to apply I think maybe tilling becomes a little bit more popular but\nNow in the meantime we have needs that need to be met today and people still use gas powered cars and so you know a pack that applied for those cars and looks like three or is something that probably ought to be considered\nSmile director of government accountability at the show the Institute in Kansas City as well

I I Can't tell you\nBill you're on the big five fifty K. theater as bill good morning\nMorning gras how I was trying to be the first one up just so\nI could say something nice before all the shouting and weeping and gnashing of teeth started way I'd like to say thank you for\nLast week's coverage of Mr Merkel and Mr mark [noise] and I can't remember if you had ... and also on the Robert Prager medication we had a nice little ceremony group of people at Morgan for debates to sign for the poor fellow that was\nA victim of mop violence in college you know a hundred years ago and it was just so informative and soul relevant in light of the several gear subjects this morning at what\nAnd said hey what are you on Saturday I said I don't know what's going on he says I'm going to be a town Josh is a town can you do the yard sale and I was like sure I'll be happy to the yard sale and um I was I got now I'll I'll teach you really had to do the yard sale\nSo uh I went on the air and I said hey I'm I'll be doing the yard sale and then I went to the bosses of the big five fifty ... and I said oh hey heads up\nUm I said I'm more than happy to do it I just a farmer they've called and said that I was going to be a ... a asked me if I could host the wall tunnel floors five fifty yard sale\nAnd I said I said I'm more than happy to do it I'd be happy to do it but you know is there is there anybody else who wants to do it or can do it or should do it or I don't know what\nThere is there anybody else who wants to do it or can do it or should do it or I don't know what\nThe right and so the next day they go out to me and they're like OK Jon ... will be doing the ah the a yard sale and I was like oh what I what I'm not good enough there are also yard sale and they were like oh\nWell the John Jay will be hosting the yard sale so somehow I just talk myself out of hosting the yard sale\nAnd it sounds like you know you asked that question said somebody else do it and apparently somebody else it do it right well\nI Wish that would work for me yeah [laughter]\nI Try I was trying to get out of doing it I Would have to sort of like hey\nGuys I'm more than happy to do it but then all of a hold of a sudden John Shays agent got involved in reverse account all of a sudden right all of a sudden John Shay is now you know the\nKind of like trying to get out of it so if I say I want to feel for Josh today\nI won't have to well [laughter] I'm going to work for you I\nReally think that a farmer day was worried that I was going to be the Katy Kirk to his Deborah normal\nThey weren't going to be the Lou Gehrig is Wally ... so that's why he gave it to me knowing or are they were afraid of that I was going to take over and you serve\nA farmer Dave so apparently that's why John shaded it so they're so the wall tunnel five fifty yard sale will ... will continue next week everybody will be in their rightful place [noise]\nUh for the three one for McGraw thanks for insulting my wife's job of twenty seven years calling a checker at a grocery store as a bottom rung job but nice try try dealing with a B te cards and W. I. C. vouchers ... now that's not what I was saying\nThat a check here's a bottom rung job what I meant was\nAn entry level job a a working class job as a young boy as a young man are just tired or or just newly married Bob Kelley took a job as a cashier\nI wasn't I was saying how there are people who are cashiers and it's a wonderful and his ... I wasn't ... whenever I disparage somebody getting up and working no matter what the other job is but the man started off as a cashier\nAnd didn't go to the finest them schools and didn't have the finest of private schools and colleges and didn't have all the benefits of other people and he rose to the ranks of being a very powerful person and being the right hand man to congressman Bob the part\nThat was my point I wasn't disparaging anybody who was a cashier I was I was complementing the man on starting off\nRight well I said last week hey if I had to do it all over again I work for UPS wife because they're looking for drivers and you know what you start off at the bottom and you you you work your way up you start off in the mail room and you work your way up I'm not disparaging people who work in the mail rooms I'm not disparaging UPS drivers\nBut UPS drivers grow up to become the c._e._o. of\nUPS right cashiers grow up to become head of the labor union that's my point was disparaging anybody going to work as a cashier really I mean\nAlright there's another one in here um\n[laughter] uh\n... why can't the Hondurans just immigrate legally\nAnd why is now the time to leave one of the problems have been there for many years surely there is a better way to come here than just show up without vetting first of all can we say that we really we were really that worried about five thousand\nStarving immigrants walking in the heat through Central America somehow they're going to invade the country\nIt's not illegal to present yourself at the border for asylum\nOkay can we get that it's not illegal to get to our shores and say you know what I Am I I'm being persecuted in my own country\nThat's not a legal there is a process when somebody gets to the border\nWhen somebody gets to the border\nAnd says I'm being persecuted right and what happens there is a process they are vetted they are screened they are take they are dealt with in a humane manner so that um if they are deemed to be\nUm a refugee if there there's all sorts of status it's not um they're coming in and if we let these people and they're going to overrun America I think it's safe to say that we can probably take five thousand immigrant migrant workers who are running from a burning building\nA Honduras or the look on doors in ... and Central America and some of the others are going through\nA massive amounts of change and there are a lot of strong men who are being elected I'm In right in all sorts of weird ways and um they don't have a very stable democracy and so people are if you don't go along with the party platform\nIf you're on the wrong side of the majority right you are being you are there's all sorts of terrible things going on and these ... these people would rather take their chances walking through the desert\nNorth and hopefully there's a better way right\n[noise] uh they're wandering in the desert\nJust to find a better place and so uh I think we need to be a little more sympathetic to them [noise] um no one's calling for open borders\nBut there is a process and there was a process in place when people do get to our shores uh remember alien Gonzales remember\nHe did not get to our shores he was rescued both his mother died\nA and it was a boat that they tried to rescue a they tried to escape Cuba they've gotten a boat the mother died that that child ailing Gonzales in what was his two thousand Nineteen Ninety Ninety thousand um he was picked up by the coast guard's so we never made it to the shore and then ultimately he was had to be sent back\nBecause the law is the law\nAnd um if you would have gotten to the shores he would have stayed but the laws very specific if you don't get to the shore right there's there was a different type of status\nI'm certainly no I'm In a legal immigrant scholar um\nBut I Do find it interesting that at that point president\nClinton wanted to send back the illegal immigrants and he was ostracized for it now the the Republican Party is against all these illegal him are immigrants but what they ... they were for it I find that somewhat interesting um\nNine forty seven here big five fifty K. T. R. S. uh let's go to a a dam Danielle the big five fifty good morning\nIt was going to bring up the Cuba thing you know they used their boats are over there trying to get them before they hit shore so they get to board them right\nUsed to vote so they try to get them before the shore so they get to board them right back yeah but what happened last time we let a bunch of people in the United states and that we tried to go through a vetting process oh heck no clue\n... with a restaurant your memory and well just recently uh separating families of their job and all that there\nWas a vetting draw those certainly wasn't but what would it be and there wasn't a vetting process\nWas attempting to do a vetting process what now\nWhat you can bet that you can bet that the family without taking the kids away\nYou don't know their their kids or not but I'm Still what I'm saying is we went ahead and let it ... the company and er into the country and they were still a big big mess so you do with the letter man everybody complains you don't let them and everybody\nNobody's talking about letting anybody\nIn your\nNo I wasn't I was talking about what if these if these are ... asylum seekers come to the border there are things there are plenty of things that are in place\nWhat what\nWhat do you meet all the all sorts of things look at ... dollars there were prior implies look let me let me ask you this question Randy why is it that there is no vetting process from people coming north\nYeah that's true\nRight so why why is it has to be the southern border when they talk about open borders there's a massive open border from seeing assigning see in the north afternoon complains about that\nIn ... yeah\nWell that's true too but I guess the you know everybody's complained because that's our last I guess we don't want or are you all and illiterate people come in the car", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The McGraw Show", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "29", "locations": [["Pittsburgh",

week to go to talk to you about your pets\nUm please give us a call here at the questions at three one for nine six nine Katie arrest we did get a text for a question about\nCatnip yeah absolutely I'd say I'm definitely if you have a cat that gets\nI'm excited and happy and a active on cutting up put it on those toys spread it around get him that might get him going some cats just want to roll around in it and take a nap so it might not help those cats\nKind of get 'em all adults like a stone yeah an ally but it never\nHurts the cat ever so you can give it a try\nSee what happens they make ... make toys are infused with now so I mean you couldn't they buy you can buy bags of catnip to having all over you know for those scratching posts and scratching hardboard things but also our towel flat out they do make toys and yeah I can literally you know we've had catnip infused bubbles\nAt our house before is that none of my cats unfortunately have gone for but like if your cat did go for that would be great exercise that I guess the plan is for them to like jump up and try to ... above bubbles I've never seen that I'll leave it to my husband he's bought every cat toy they're interesting\nIf Logan weren't so darn old and can't really jump I Would totally be granted right that'd be pretty cool oh my gosh that would be awesome for a cat in up in general yeah the cat and it was fantastic it using for weight loss obviously you want to make sure that doesn't cause them sleepiness and take I make him take a longer nap in the Eighteen hour nap that they take all day anyway\nSo [laughter] um catnip it's very cool and and you can get those at any any oh anywhere that's absolutely I'm so let's do a little diving into the consequences of overweight ... nobody knew yeah yeah so there's always consequences to your actions and who you're a\nLifestyle lifestyle choices unfortunately [laughter]\nSo ah let's see ... well I guess most of this really applies to both cats and dogs sure more heart disease a tension yup absolutely hypertension high blood pressure uh insulin resistance so\nType two diabetes basically a witch death as I mentioned I dealt with in my own chunky ...\nExtra fat leads to insulin resistance so it makes them not being able to respond to insulin as efficiently and you know we've got fifty percent of our all these cats have a decrease in insulin sensitivity and that it really really increases the risk for diabetes\nAbsolutely and you guys I had the sweetest cat and the universe but still I Do not enjoy given him shots twice a day oh no not not fun for me\nIt's a little bit uh limiting and the freedom to go out and enjoy your evening from the selfish human point of view and so we had to get shots twice a day well unfortunately\nDiabetes decreases our life and it turned out to you know they give you an average of of from diagnosis of diabetes to lung you know tell they pass away usually for years now and and unfortunately unless obviously the you know it's some cats are easier to regulate than others but they really you want your animals to live as long as they possibly can\nYeah and it's if you think about it you know if your cat is as big an early age and gets diagnosed with diabetes it six you know you've real shave some years office\nSince we're talking about cats yeah how about ... fatty liver disease I mean just the most simple is like hold of not eating for a couple of days can push them into fatty liver disease\nAnd this is where their body is taking energy from the liver and replacing\nThat with fat and so that can pretty quickly lead into a situation where the cat is in liver failure has to have be hospitalized have things like feeding tubes place it's a pretty significant\nDie from yeah I got I think so yeah so it's certainly you know if you if you have a overweight cat uh hopefully you are working on their weight loss but if they ever have a period of time even you know twenty four forty eight hours of not eating\nThat's a phone call to your veterinarian because we don't want to get secondary ramifications of the not eating um and unfortunately some cats can kind of just go on\nStrike to eat without any underlying reasons sometimes just a little bit of stress can trigger that and so it's really important is that does happen to to contact your veterinarian there are some appetite stimulant and maybe even some testing to make sure that there isn't anything else going on\nBut [laughter] but um anyway I I don't know a little out of power I don't know for that one that are in um both cats\nThe dog parks and recreation six one eight to Seventy seven twenty two Seventy five or take a tour on their website anytime\nThat lucky dog

S. or you can text us at eight for one to six\nUm we did have someone who um\nMessage over the last segment and asked approximately how many calories her a female spade eighty pound Labrador Retriever would need and I I Know this is a frustrating question but the answer is we don't we don't know\nYou would really have to put our hands on her and determine what her body condition score is and what her current weight and then what her ideal weight would be in order to be able to calculate that so\nIt would probably be a very good idea ten maybe have a consultation with your veterinarian about that and they can help figure that out for you ...\nIt will tell you to just off the cuff I have an eighty pounds neutered male dog and he gets about two cups of food a day but that that is really I Can't really kept his ... he's really high energy not a couch potato\nAnd he is on you know I don't know what kind of food right food ... the kind of food also makes a huge difference because we also need to know what the calories per cop are for the food so in short\nContact your veterinarian and they can help you determine what the ideal weight would be and then the calorie requirements for her as well as like\nYeah yeah that would be my number one recommendation I'm ... and speaking about foods there are there really are huge\nVariety a of number of calories in a cup of dog or cat food so I'm just now if anybody tells you oh all dogs that way thirty pounds need this number of ... per day don't believe them because it all depends on um\nWhat kind of dog how how accurate that dog is is he neutered and especially what kind of food or see on that certainly and and be sure if you have an adult dog or cat\nTake a minute look at your bag of dog food and make sure that that food is for adult\nAnimals if it says for all life stages that means that it has enough calories\nTo maintain gross and either puppies are kittens and your adult animal is not growing and does not need those calories should not be growing up we don't want any horizontal gross and\nNot even necessarily just gross leads to use also are higher and protein they're higher in some requirements for that growth which can also have a negative impact on an older dogs organs kidneys livers et cetera so he's all life stages foods are\nJust they they they need well may sound great because you've got a puppy at home and you've got a twelve year old dog at home we we can feed the same food\nBut it really is not how you're supposed to feed your animals each one needs to have their own the puppies kittens need to have their own poppy kitten food I\nOn the on puppies kittens need to have their own puppy kitten food adult dogs need to have their own adult food\nAnd we know we know that they all want to eat each other's food I Know and it is hard and I don't have a magic bullet for how to solve this problem it takes creativity and you sometimes just have to stand there and be present while they're eating and then pull up their food\nWell I you know I I have two dogs and their their Labrador Retrievers and as if everybody's had known Labrador Retrievers they live for food that's all they think about twenty four seven is food\nAnd both of my dogs eat and completely separate area as one dog eats in one room and the other dog eats and the other room behind closed doors when they're done with our food the bulls get picked up and it's not left down\nAnd it's you know people people who feed their animals free feet free fat meaning they leave the food down all the time and just fill the ball as it's empty\nSometimes that can play in your favor if you've got a dog but just kind of takes the cable once or twice but there is no way in the world that certain breeds of dog and certain dogs can be fat free sad because they will eat until\nNow all of it completely down and you know three back to the food layers yeah so it's really important to be able to and and honestly when you are free feeding food you're leaving the food down all the time it's really number one difficult to measure how much food they're eating number two it's hard to regulate the other dogs or cats in the house that are trying to get to the food as well\nAnd it's it's also sometimes speaking of not even obesity but if you have any animal that's free fad sometime you don't catch their lack of appetite ... until they haven't eaten for three or four meals\nWhereas if you've got an animal who is fed at a certain time you know immediately oh they didn't eat there want to eat their breakfast this morning we keep rise pray\nAnd hope they didn't want to eat their dinner time to call the veterinarian mhm so so all of these you know it's it's important to be able to to know how much you're feeding measure their food and and it helps control their their intake\nYeah and and guys they're annoying like they are annoying my cat's drives me crazy from about if I'm home three thirty PM till five pm get fed at five PM like I I totally get it these animals\nAre they love food I Love food I sympathize with them I Wish I had somebody saying to me no\nNo no you don't get to eat anything right now\nYou have to wait till dinner and I had to listen out I I said I suppose that's why the celebrities are often and beautiful because they do have that person so [laughter] it's just thinking about it that way your dog or cat is going to be thin and beautiful just like the celebrities because here their their personal nutritionist keeping them on track", "show_name": "The McGraw Show", "year": "2018",

All right thank you are there knows well the news this week cp snow number twelve or so there you go All right do we have Molly hunter\nMolly hunter ABC News correspondent assemble turkey covering the I'm a bizarre story I'm Molly hunter or over the weekend it seems like Saudi Arabia has changed their story once again\nIraq in the morning I get my cat is that the third radically different plenty to what happened to Jamal ... twenty two and a half weeks ago\nFatty official originally sad you know it's a show he walked out on his on a on a kept our second and we are getting pretty quickly that probably true\nThat over the weekend they cut out a official government statement that said okay with a thick accent and he came in the fifth grade\nAnd that's how he died and I didn't even tricky for like six I use the word for all of which I think we can all agree that commonly commonly used and we stuck with a fatty official yesterday and this that you said actually it was not like\nHe came and he tried to reverse that physical altercation and see what else F ... fighter Eighteen guys spend attain credit card and not have the guy\nDo we know where the body is\nWay down and the guy that had the big question that is that everyone talking today about the same fatty fish that we suffered yesterday\nAnd told us another narrative that runs counter to the Turkish narrative at least I Am and they said if I was given to a local coffee trader and ... percent gay who gave it to cooperate and who is a local cooperate or whether they decided that\nWe have no idea where he can have a report that the body was brought up in Iraq\nThat the last three weeks Turkish officials had said ... he was brutally killed inside the conflict he ... his memory and that that wouldn't have than a body per se ... found the Turkish officials instantly through cold water on that\nYou know what a Molly hunter watch the endgame here what what is I mean the Saudis are trying to weasel out of what I mean right I mean what's the endgame here if if they come out and said yes she was murdered he was killed we did it a little what's right I mean what's the what's the plan here\nRight the game it's I think every from the states I think President Trump is going to have to decide if that if what if I Am saying that\nWhat the us is going to dinner and we have heard of ... from President Trump where the last couple of weeks is that we need to wait for the investigation into it kept the president's access to anything that the next ten days he said we need to wait and get the cat is a time\nAnd finally over the weekend she exercise or at least to voice a little bit of caution and is that a narrative that he called the Washington Post and said okay obviously they spend a lot of conception there for

I don't know what exactly happened but\nIt is not uncommon for those injuries to happen at the same time if it's a you know a lot of times it's you know they're both they can both happened at the same time um so that that's not that rare but it does suggest it was\nIt was not you know a subtle tweak it was a you know a bad one um it's it's really cool because just the day before\n... who had its tip off of there where after the football game they had a you know folks go over to the basketball arena dumped contact and did a little scrimmage just to give folks kind of a teamster of so many players things like that and Dante we really\nLook good I'm to the point that you know he at one point jumped up and threw down to put back dark that we've never really seen him get up like that before and he was asked about it\nAfter that scrimmage and he said that you know he deals with you know need ten tonight at sea have had some he has always had you know sore knee you've asked about\nUm you know his family has a you know a long history of of the problems is from starting with his his dad who who you know as you can tell as he walks around the court he's got you know he's got problems with with Disney is er\nWhich aren't they using this as a positive way he was saying I feel great you know my knees are behaving I feel like I can jump and fly in and do the things that I've always wanted to do but haven't always been able to show it can be\nAnd then the next day this happens just the cruel thing for him to have to talk about you know how good he feels in that area and then the next day you know one bad move and all of a sudden you're season's over\nSo last week you were on the show and then you went and it gives them a news conference a with Moe and everybody was all a foreigner over what most said did he say anything about Bryce Harper or allude to Bryce Harper ... in any way shape or form\nYou can't I mean you gotta you can't you can't say a into free agency officially begins you can't talk about a guy I mean you'd ... you'd face you know ... punishment in front of the league right he did\nSay you know he said they need the hitter he said that that's just the top of their shopping list um he did talk a lot about you know\nHe his decisions are going to look for off in ... and you know there's only so many positions to upgrade um at least ... that makes sense on paper right now that could change and he talked about kind of the need for for someone who stabilize the middle of the line up he also said that look you know\nSome of the decisions that we make might not be the popular ones um so I think he's trying to acknowledge that they need in office of booze she's also trying to think\nFanned the flames a little bit that it's hard for a bus this off season because that's not ever have the cardinals operates so she did not he did not throw gas on the fire but he did say we need someone who's going to be kind of a middle of the order presence on the line up because we once\nAgain lacks that he did throw a little shade on those you know what that shoulder injury\nA little I'm no more than that yeah basically I think is to get it got tired of being asked why the cardinals didn't get it was you know shoulder right any I mean he's very adamant about pointing out it's a two way street when it comes to that\nI think they felt like march so\nFor whatever reasons was you know kind of stubborn when I came to getting treatment and that's going to be a big theme of the off season those guys being diligent getting a write in coming into spring training ready to go not coming into spring training ready to find out what's wrong\nUm you know and it makes every ... since ... to\nTo do that this off season I mean he is entering a contract year he's not just playing for the cardinals the season is playing for every other team that might want to sign him\nSo you know he he made a commitment to the team to be ready to go um they told them they will help him in whatever way they can no matter where he is this off season he just has to follow through with that you're supposed to eat meat with his doctor\nAround the end of the month and and they're going to decide what exactly is the plan is I guess there is still you know some sort of a chance that could be some sort of operation but it did not sound like that um at least at the press conference so it sounds like it's going to come down to rehab and you know physical therapy which if he's not diligent and like I don't know how he could expect much different\nResults next season and then lastly Ben ... today dot com singles posed this dispatch a columnist sports groups do you agree with me or for you wrong headed when it comes to\nUm the bullpen use right the brewers are great bullpen was it just burned out and abused and exhausted so over used that that that they couldn't overcome the Dodgers\nSoil I mean they didn't have any other options ... I mean they if they had that they had a bunch of good starters I think they would have been a more traditional style the ... the bird we all season that's been there starting rotation\nSo they they tried to find a way to to work around that and the way to work around that is to lean heavily on an elite bullpen that only got better as the seasons are more alarming that's risky anytime you're doing it but the more and more teams are doing it\nToward the toward the post season when every game matters so much so if they were sitting or pulling really good starters all the time to do it I Would say yeah I don't know five ... if I'm by that if they're pulling Clinton Kurdish off the mountain to weddings that I'm maybe I'm not the greatest idea but they don't have that guy\nThat one good start or one of their other starters dealing with down um you know so so he had the ankle injury so they even lost one of them and he was just okay so\nThey really didn't have any other option I I think what they were trying to do and I understood it was they were just trying to pitch their best pitchers as much as possible and then their case their best pitchers were relievers so\nInevitably you know it didn't it didn't work out but they got further than most teams\nOr who were some of the states there are above the Missouri [noise]\nWell I think notably is a state that went on about Missouri state of Tennessee and for a long time we have compared herself to\nTennessee as one of the faith that does tax all the right and this is the year and we actually moved past them and you look at other states that do it pretty well and you're looking at states like Oklahoma you're looking at states like Florida generally speaking they fight taxes\nBut I think Missouri has been a pretty good spot I don't think that we're quite a low tech state yet I think we still have a long way to go particularly on the sales tax and with the fact\nThat is less a question or or you know direct problem upstate all the more problem of local uh taxing district and local policies that kind of stack up sales taxes overtime [noise]\nUm but I think by and large where you're looking at is a pretty good taxing environment for the state I think there's you know work to be done as there always will be but I think that we're having the right direction and and you know fortunately after this you know this past year were ahead of Tennessee So that something could be very optimistic about\nYeah you know you mentioned Texas or Florida or you can't drive to the gas station without having some type of a toll road on your car so right they got a bunch of toll roads the easy pass\nSo we don't have that here so we we we tax or roads right this prop ... is going to be a a sales tax or a gas tax so you know it's not always apples to apples when you compare state like Florida having a low sales tax\nAnd and no state income tax as opposed to Missouri [noise]\nYeah I you know you you end up having to weigh those uh you know costs and benefits of having toll roads are having higher gas taxes or instead if you want to provide funding for those\nThat infrastructure or whether you're going to do it through like just a general income tax we long talked about how important to to make sure that if you're using the road that you should probably be the one that pays for it first and foremost the best way to do that\nIs through gas taxes answered going in your exactly right you really don't see towing here in the state of Missouri media at all I Can't think of a place off hand where we actually do that here\nBut they do it in Kansas they do it all across North if they do it you know in lock places across country an antique that you're trying to mitigate the tax burden on everybody and and try to concentrate that caught people who are using it I think that you know polling is an option but if you're not going to be telling like gas taxes and the next best option\nYeah Patrick go more on the website about this stuff yeah gosh I mean that trick is my I have a good day Patrick thanks for taking it very too big five fifty a K tiara let me\nTell you about speaking of vehicles Johnny loaned up Chevrolet highway two Seventy or the Washington those are the ...

tip they ask you a zero\nFifteen twenty twenty five percent so if it's over ten then you're into the percentages before that you were in the one dollar to so if it's five dollars they're asking you hey how about a dollar tip\nVery you know the tip jar it's I Know is the twenty first century version the digital tip jar but the tip jar is they are right and if you feel inclined that you ... there is a place I go I'm for lunch often times\nAnd I go there I go there quite often and I've become friendly with the people and I usually tip with um my phone or my debit card and every once in a while I've got cash and when I have cash I stuff that tip jar full of cash because these guys work hard and I don't have cash all the time whatever else right\nBut I don't I'm not asked every time for a

the corner saying ah you know please I'm I'm I'm homeless give me five dollars or\nThe overwhelming majority of those people\nAre going to take that money and to give it to the drug dealer so my argument was or is if you really want to help the homeless\nGive money to St Patrick's center do you know who says that\nSt Patrick's center the people who run the homeless the right the people who are our job it is is to run the programs to help the homeless get back up onto their feet if you give money to a homeless person you are not solving the problem you might be making yourself feel

idea\n[noise] um\nI Do know that I Do know that we do have a statue of liberty that says give us your poor your tired your hungry yearning to breathe free I Do know I Do know that sort of one of the

have always in the past been open to refugees right people seeking political asylum people who are afraid for their life right so I don't know where the whole thing goes in there but there's something there's something over the weekend that that I heard and\nSaw [noise] and I just sort of a it just sort of\nA it's it's not easy I\nAnd I don't know and I don't know what to do and that this isn't a political comment there's been a political statement one way or the other\nBut and I don't really quote the Bible much in this but isn't there a saying in the Bible that says what you do to the least of me you do to me isn't that isn't that a passage in the in that in Matthew somewhere\nAnd so as we try and figure out as a country what to do with these five thousand seven thousand people who are taking whatever they have on their backs and walking up to Mexico and they don't know where they're going but they know they're getting out of\nHarm's way that what you do\nTo the least of my brothers you do to me isn't that what Jesus said at some point\nRight and so isn't what we do to these people\nWhat we do to Jesus\nAnd I see a lotta people praising Jesus around here and around the country and for years right praise Jesus\nAnd so if these are the poorest among us\nIf these people\nTired poor and hungry you're earning to breathe free that would get on\nTheir shoes whatever type of shoes they have but whatever they have in a nap stack and start walking north\nUm that's the least among us and so as a society as a person who is\nLiving on the earth in the richest country in the

still not judging either way the outcome here they're waiting for the results of this investigation and while it may seem to many many around the world really that the Saudis must be responsible for this company ... still pumping the brake\nAlso President Trump is sort of a looted and and and and my reading list this right counter President Trump has sort of a looted and sort of thrown out the trial balloon well yeah\nHey it's tragic that one one guy might have been murdered but we've got a hundred and ten billion dollar deal on the table we don't want to clear that deal it was one guy\nYeah exactly you know and and the other thing he has said that was in a U.S you know this was in a U.S lawful permanent resident and I've heard that from some folks within the administration that this isn't really in our lame they don't they don't seem to take a for lack of a better word care about it because\nUh it doesn't directly involved someone that's within their jurisdiction the end of the you're right President Trump doesn't want to spoil that a hundred and ten billion dollar memorandum of intent that he signed with the Saudis ... arms sales ill\nDown the line you know that would affect not only his bottom line in terms of you had to go but also American Jobs on the line\nI'm line in terms of these armed go but also American Jobs on the line and that's something that he continually says\nA lot of people do including Republicans on the hill senior Republicans who really need to foreign policy circles like Lindsey Graham Bob Corker it could be a turning point in us Saudi relations you know it's not it's not the first time that the crown prince\nHas sort of disruptive things in the middle east you remember last year a there was a ... it's actually kidnapped the Lebanese prime minister and hold them off the trip here at the time and this is just perhaps the straw that finally breaks the camel's back for some of those Republican Lindsey Graham yesterday on Fox News\nSaying that he will not step foot in Saudi Arabia until crown prince Mohammed bin Salman goes\nSo what's the next step on this we sit and wait for the Trump Administration to do something you know\nIt's actually that that's where we are at this point um they say they're waiting for the investigation to to reach some sort of to finish the conclusion\nThat could be a wild and in the meantime as you said earlier you know we've got these\nExtraordinary leaks coming out from turkey and I'm sure more of those details will come out now been a couple of outlets are reporting equipment to Wall Street journal this morning that their audio audio that where you can hear Jamal shocked the\nAnswer to count and be killed almost immediately upon entering and so we'll continue to hear these things but you know leak out in dribs and drabs and until until the conclusion reaches end though the district and says they won't do anything\nA kind of an ABC News correspondent I could talk for an hour about this because there's so many different angles to it was only but they're kind of and again at the state department ... thanks where are you a story came out yesterday that they said that he was dismembered with that\nBones or a ... still alive you are they also say that the other thing too as I'm\nPresident Trump keeps talking about this hundred and ten billion dollars that sort of um [noise] that's not a it's not a receipt it's not a done deal there's all sorts of contingencies on that and so this half a million dollar jobs no one knows where that numbers coming from either so I'm ... and then\nNine eleven right we promised we promised every one we would never forget Fifteen of Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and yet we turn around and say oh the Mexican rape is\nThat we don't talk from Wall around Saudi Arabia we weren't talking\nAbout the the Saudis post nine eleven when it was still fresh in our minds and we found out that Osama bin Laden family members right members were were allowed to\nTake off of a a cable Clarence Thomas has somebody in a high place that they should\nAnd and and I guess rightfully so during the election people were apoplectic over somebody some Saudi prince giving the Clinton Foundation some money to find out now that you know Trump is has had close financial ties with the Saudi Government with the princes all throughout the last Twenty years\nWell I think if you are a person is means if you have been successful in business at ... at that level of course you've had\nSome ... you you've had ... with the Saudi royal family but what I Love that man and Lindsey Graham God love and we saw during the cabinet hearings and he was no longer a senator from South Carolina he was Rambo right I mean he says well it's very fiery but he's ... he was saying he's got\nTo go a prince is out in the crown prince some I ate he'd sit crown prince or does he think do you know they're not gonna they're not going to send him into the salary they at the consulate\nWhile you're in front of you have a president of the United states that has financial ties\nUm and close financial ties hundreds of millions of dollars with this country which is now a a a accused of murdering\nJournalists as they walk into an embassy in a different country well now I mean how how can a how can any individual separate hundreds of millions of dollars of business interests and the interest of the country he's running\nA weird place to be in a specially when half of the country was complaining that Hillary couldn't do it\nRemember when that was it George W. Bush or George H W. Bush was at forty one or forty three I there was a famous photograph of him holding hands with one of the kinks out or whatever his name was and everybody was so you know kind of taken aback by that\nAbsolutely there's a there's a company called ...\nAnd then you will live yeah mhm so it's pretty clear Netflix's more new economy consumer economy five yeah there's more the old economy there great new product watching but still the company is more old economy\nAnd they both reported hurting after the market close yesterday idea will be awesome today because their earnings were disappointing [laughter] um what should be very very strong early in the day is like the numbers like quiet\nVery very strong earlier today as they think numbers like quite a bit um [noise] so it just\n... what's taking place between the two economies\nYeah Ali I'm Sorry I didn't mean to cut you off there\nNot just the two economies whether it's a Netflix or you know service with pizza or [noise] you know home delivery or where consumer economy much more than we used to be\nYeah and that was a lot of people bad mouth that Netflix met with that subscriber base in those ten dollars and Fifteen dollar a monthly fee is coming in every month that is a great business model right they're they're bringing in millions of dollars\n... billion perspective last year this quarter they may twenty nine cents a share market Alice we're predicting sixty cents to share it made a DUI wow\nTwenty nine to eighty nine that a lot of gross\nThat is a lot of gross um imagine how much they make if I stop giving up my password on my neck Netflix account getting I'm getting I'm getting a U.S bank what did they say\nThey had excellent earnings report it also and that was about thirty minutes ago just the sporting um quarterly profits up Seventeen percent revenues increased as well I talk with your all week about\nThe good earnings report by the bank Trump last friday from Monday here's another big bank report and good earnings what's interesting when you look through the numbers they're not performing at that decreased\nBy Nineteen percent so that's a good sign for them it's a good sign for eight out of the economy\nMm All right you have a note here us back on top of the most competitive economy in the world explain yourself\n[laughter] I've had that quote before explain yourself to leave anytime you left the economy on top of the world\nThe world Economic Forum right the economy is a hundred and forty countries we're not there and the top economy since Nineteen I'm Sorry two thousand and eight so it's been ten years\nUm we were rated number one single for Germany Switzerland Japan right behind a\nCandidate was twelve and this is the interesting when China was ready to twenty eight ... ...\nAnd you know I think most of us know us as really had to pass the economy in the world but they're rating the most competitive and competitiveness to remain one of the best show innovation freedom of movement in income inequality being future ready sustainability\nA labor market practices ethics transparency call they won't go into the rating it's good to just be on the top the top all the way our number one a lot but it also is as much as China's growing and when we talk about them\nSee them all the way down to that want to get any kind of seeing with\nSustainability labor market practices ethics transparency where certain countries lack as well\nSo basically what you're saying is you can bad mouth America and the economy and everything else but remember where the best in the world\nWe had a lot of good things happening here yeah I'd like Thomas markets today how do they look\nIt looks like a start down about a year Ninety points um ...

short I know I Know and it's meant to show that hair Adam Kelsey\nEnjoy this ABC News local correspondent talking about the polls three weeks from yesterday is election day couldn't get here soon enough Adam Kelsey ABC News political correspond thanks for joining us hey thanks for having me All right so I heard somebody say uh the other day\nThat Beto O'Rourke in Texas has a whole lot of energy in his in his base unfortunately has base lives in New York\nI I think that you could certainly say that\nOr work has gotten a lot of support from around the country now that's not to say that he doesn't have the support in Texas as well and we've seen some polls that happened within single digits of of Ted Cruz down in Texas but if you take a look at the fund raising the better or worse than thirty eight million dollars over the course of the last three months [noise]\nOdds are that that's not all coming from Texas so he's seen as a democratic rising star uh people are opening their wallets from California out to New York as you said um but that doesn't necessarily mean that he's not going to be able to drive people out to the polls in just under three weeks\nWhile it sounds like a Ted Cruz is starting to to pull away a little bit\nYeah he's looked a little bit better in some of the polls that we've seen in recent weeks and and things got a little bit ugly last night to beat it again\nOr down in Texas Ted Cruz really portrayed Beto O'Rourke as as a member of the Democratic establishment he basically said that you know shouldn't believe all of the campaign talk that you're seeing from him ah you know don't get sucked in by him riding a skateboard through water burger parking lot as we've seen a couple of times\nUh and Ted Cruz basically saying that once he gets to Washington as a member of the Senate ah he's probably just gonna fall in line with with Chuck Schumer and the rest of the Democrats\nYeah ... uh the national peace talk about Texas they talk about Nevada they talk about Heidi Heitkamp a\nThey seem to gloss over the Claire McCaskill Josh Hawley race here in Missouri apparently this is neck and neck\n[noise] it it's going to be extremely close and I'll say this about Claire McCaskill is that this isn't\nHer first rodeo you know she's gone through close races every single time she's run this is her third in a row Josh Hawley a good candidate another one of these young rising stars this time in the ...\nIn a row Josh Hawley a good candidate another one of these young rising stars this time in the Republican Party\nUm but I keep bringing up fundraising because it makes a big difference in the in these last days of the campaign and Claire McCaskill reason thirty million dollars over the course of this election cycle Josh Hawley just eat point five million dollars\nOr something to scoff at there but you know twenty two million dollar gas is part of the reason why Democrats feel as if McCaskill may be okay or that that's not to say she's a lock by any means a necessary but\nAh you know that twenty two million dollars extra as far as getting her on TV on the radio to get our message out there are certainly helps\nYou know that shocking I Can't believe that Josh Hawley zone a hard time raising funds the whole time I find that shocking if this is such a a nationally watched race that he would have a hard time raising money\nI mean he's still is relatively new to politics I you know that attorney general election or was his first real foray into things I'm so sometimes it's about kind of building up\nYour brand and for Josh ... donations may have come from within Missouri but he may have a tough time attracting donors from outside the state which sometimes is a necessary evil like we talked about with better or him and that in that respect McCaskill more of a name brand\nThere Adam Kelsey let's leave the house for a second and stay in the Senate I haven't heard that the Senate could go anywhere from fifty seven Republicans all the way down to a Democratic Senate\nYeah we were seeing a wide range of possible outcomes here in the polls have been inconsistent ah and you look at some of these states where are you know you would have thought Democrats never had a chance a state like Tennessee for example were Phil Bredesen is really running from the middle he said he would have voted for Brett Kavanaugh he said he would sit down and meet with Donald Trump\nHe's been able to attract some of the Republican and some of the crossover voters there in Tennessee Democrats feel optimistic about that on the flip side you know there are still a lot of Republican red leaning Donald Trump states out there where there are Democratic senators\nOr that we can see flip you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota a little bit earlier Jon Tester in Montana is another one Joe mansion in West Virginia these are all rock solid Republican states\nThat have crossed over to vote for Democratic senators in the past and when you talk about as many as fifty seven Republicans perhaps uh in the next set it a lot of them would be coming from those states\nYeah uh what about the house what's the latest on the house\nWe still see the houses as most likely leaning towards Democrats or we we partner with a recall the nerds at five thirty eight who do their forecast they give him a big if the Democrats a six and seven chance of winning control the house one in seven chance of Republicans\nKeeping control and whenever we talk about these numbers people think six and seven that must be a lock for the Democrats but\nYou know if if I told you they're seven doors and there was a million dollars behind one of those doors you might say to yourself wow I got a pretty good chance of winning a million dollars so they're still they want us to one in seven chance Republicans keeping control as far as five thirty eight says uh so it's certainly not out of the question\nI just won the record I Would pick the door with a nothing behind it [laughter] it's just just shows you're my luck Adam Kelsey have you seen those political corresponding for checking in\nDriving me All right now a Heidi Heidi a Wendy

the morning Dr Michael em good morning how are you hungry so uh there's been a story that's been sort of um making its way through the news of the last couple of days and weeks I guess last week or so backed um there's a some polio\nLight disease or virus or sickness that it's working its way through it seems to be hitting kids and it started in Minnesota but now it's going and uh being being shown in a number of different states what's going on while the update a\nA came from the CDC and this is the CDC job is to monitor dry or things like this is is a a new illness not known before a polio like a affects the the spinal cord and to\nResults in some paralysis especially the upper extremity soon a CDC updated instead sixty two confirmed cases this year in the United states or and they've been tracking this since two thousand and fourteen\nStates are and they've been tracking this since two thousand and fourteen or then locally apparently there's one confirmed case in St Louis area\nA there's a lot more cases in Illinois but they're all in northern Illinois there is no confirmed cases are sort of in Illinois closer to the St\nLouis or when they say polio like\nWhat do they mean by that it means that say a a disease which attacks the neurologic system of the nerves and so all of a sudden you don't have the ability to use\nThose cables to control the muscles and so you lose that and then all of this and you can't you can't use your arms is showing up in kids it is showing up in kids that's part of the the diagnostic criteria now is I think this is a a illness that are kind of\nLooks at Eighteen year old folks are younger uh\nProblem is and the scary thing is there's no known cause as of yet\nOh they've tested all of the known cases for actually polio and turned out that there is no actual polio in any of these so the\nThe polio vaccine itself still I think remains good and true to the test meaning the polio has basically been eradicated for the most part of but this is possibly a complication of another virus and so there and\nYou know common colds are caused by viruses there at new viruses are intro viruses are names\nUh some of those viruses we know from a heart standpoint or more closer to my business\nCan attack the heart and can cause severe problems from heart standpoint called market is\nIt possible uh but not confirmed that some of these viruses or a certain strain of these viruses might attack the spinal cord\nAnd uh end up with this type of condition um they're putting in a lot of resources in it uh they've put forward a updates for conditions and hospitals diagnostic criteria if you see a case like this is the samples we want running a bunch of tests to try to track down what's causing this is it\nPermanent or do you regained your your motor functions after awhile\nUnfortunately as of right now it looks like that's permanent really a motor functions or her not coming back when\nYou say polio like I Know you just said that they didn't test it tested and it wasn't polio but there are kids who are not getting the polio vaccine for certain reasons and we know that some viruses mutate so any evidence of any of that having to do with this\nWell I think you'd have to uh get to live the concrete like bottom line answer from that from the CDC but as far as I can understand from what they said earlier this week\nUh this isn't a polio type virus and so nothing it was it doesn't the only thing that has to do with polio is that the syndromes and and the symptoms have some similarities but it only affects the upper extremity so that's a little bit different yeah\nUh yes viruses mutate so certainly the to viruses that I named to add new virus and the ... virus\nThese are these are viral strains and a highly possible that there's been so mutation along the line that allows them to kind of a hone in on the neurologic system and the spinal cord\nI grew up in a world where we didn't worry about polio polio wasn't in our wasn't in our\nConsciousness was polio or is it or was it\nCould you catch it from somebody else was it like a common cold where you had to stay away from people with polio\nWell it was a virus and uh the the spreading of of viruses varies depends on the particular virus or a but the ... there were polio epidemics where it did spread and there were a significant outbreaks where large groups of populations came down with it and this was pretty devastating\nAnd so the advent of the polio virus was one of them are dead vaccine for this virus was one of the first\nUh to come around as a vaccine to really\nBe proof of concept of what we really can take a serious infectious disease a virus and and kind of basically\nPut our shoe on top of it and squash it like a bug and and it really work as phenomenal concepts are proof of concept and we've been waiting and looking for every time now how many times you hear\nA well maybe there's a vaccine for this condition or maybe the vaccine for that condition or about a decade ago there's a concept of\nAll we can we were going to work really hard at a vaccine to come up to treat HIV and then keep moving forward right among other aspects of so you know that there there is a great story and the polio vaccine it really has worked um\nThe this a diseased state that we're talking about right now this is in its infancy we don't ... before you can come up the vaccine you have to actually come up with the specific cause right so it's not just that type of virus it's the specific one and how it actually works and then you can targeted or to be able to try to\nSort of all we know is that it's a virus but now we don't know they don't know that that's\nThe leading at the leading theory\nA we actually don't know it's a virus or could be an environmental toxin or it's possible you have to throw in there is some sort of genetic predilection to getting us as well uh\nUh it seems to happen only kids so what's different about or maybe the immune system or the growing nervous system of young adults and children are I think there's a lot of things that are wide open and again that's why I say this is a little bit scary because we're way more questions than we have answer right\nYeah um but as of today sixty some odd kids have been diagnosed sixty\nTwo in the United states this year a but there's about six hundred and some cases since two thousand and fourteen around the world ... ah you know just in this kind of just in the ... he's been tracking it in this country while ah so he could get on the CDC website they can give you the table\nNumber case into those fourteen Fifteen sixteen Seventeen and so foreign aid\nDo they have a name of it or they just keep calling this polo full you'll like we'll have a name\nFor you can go the polio like illness or for now until we find a real cause for it and and be able to give out specific information uh that everybody wants like well how can I avoid it right or in in what what can I Do to prevent my kids were getting these are important questions but unfortunately we do not have answers to\nLive from the studio by fifty immigrants you on the\n\nCity is in half which every single

that's where you can read his column and also you can get the newspaper right at your soup or or online at the kinds of mourning Tony\nMore immigrants are mourning Shelley how is everybody today\nSo I'm a ... a last week or a couple of weeks ago you did a story about I'm being arrested for being poor and it was a pretty interesting story you're now back with a part too which is even more disturbing than the first one you talked about\nWhat a lot of counties throughout Missouri is is very similar to what\nWe're used to here in St Louis what we reported on a lot\nBack in twenty four and a twenty Jay related to them you know it's awkward throughout St Louis county only what's happening in rural Missouri is worse basically people are getting arrested for small offenses are one of the women that I've written about actually two different women that I've written about\nRelated to this case both in ... county got arrested for shoplifting makeup and and I'm not condoning shoplifting but in one case it was twenty four dollars worth of of a nail polish and in another case it was literally an eight dollar Cuba mascara\nThey get arrested actually get jailed rather than just issued a summons because they the judge that's bad they can't afford bail so they're in jail for\nFor a period of time sometimes thirty days or longer before they can get a public defender get a bond hearing whatever\nThey end up pleading guilty to something that maybe they only get probation or they get time served so they get thrown in jail for their shoplift\nChin or they get time served so they did thirty days in jail for their shoplifting which isn't necessarily unreasonable if that's the standard you set in your community but then this is what happens the county status them a bill for their time in jail and it's about fifty bucks a day\nThese are people that couldn't afford\nA ... a small amount of bail a couple of thousand bucks to get out of jail now they've got this bill\nFor several hundred dollars or a couple of thousand dollars for their time in jail and then the judge said some months we're hearing called a show cause hearing come in and show me that you're paying your bill or that you pay down and not be your ...\nSometimes they missed one of those hearings sometimes they show up and they say sorry judge I don't have any money I haven't been able to pay ... stand it puts them in jail for a probation violation\nThe woman that I wrote about this last week broke broke and did a year in jail after her eight dollar shoplifting charge because she felt behind paying her jailed bill\nHer jailed bill now I wrote in the column is more than ten thousand dollars\nI Would stay spoke with her last night each Eighteen thousand dollars now she's got to go to court again in November to show the judge sorry I haven't been able to make payments on it you keep kicking me away from my kids and away from my job and then you get me an extra bill when I go to jail\nShe may get sent to jail again in that Eighteen thousand dollar bill becomes something something else can committed any other crime sense that\nIt is it is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen it is purely a debtors prison\nAnd it's happening I've written about it in St Francis county it's happening in ... county it's happening and Crawford county it's happening all over the state and this was a massive problem for the Missouri judiciary\nTony I thought you mention debtors prison we all learned about it in high school it was illegal how does it will be legal in the state of Missouri\nBecause what they're arguing is that\nThe the jail bill they call it a board bills don't bore during all they're arguing and the public defender's office just before the appeals court all three appeals courts in the state saying that there's this constitutional\nWhat what these county judges are arguing is that the board bill is part of the fine in court costs\nAnd so they're arguing that these people because they aren't paying they're fine they haven't fulfilled\nThe original sentence so they're the judge is arguing that says and debtors prison I'm not putting them in jail because they're poor I'm not putting them in jail because they can't stay at that I'm putting them in jail because they haven't fulfilled their probation\nBash the argument I think it was on its surface\nAt least one appeals court has already ruled that you can't keep adding up these court costs on decay suits and and and then put people in jail that the the judge just wrote it creates this endless merry go round that um\nThat that these poor people in these rural counties are having to deal with and\nUltimately I think the Missouri Supreme Court is going to have to not only rule on these cases to tell these ... just you can't do this anymore\nYou're gonna have to have the Supreme Court issued new rules in some guidance so these judges no it's just not reasonable practice and down and watch the county's realize they can't fund themselves on the backs of poor people you're going to have to face some of the same questions we're facing here in St Louis county\nEvery one of the hundred and fourteen counties in the state need their own courthouse need their own uh you know judicial system or do we need to start talking about some form of judicial consolidation so that we're\nSo that the initial courts that people are dealing with in our society are are run with the same sort of professionalism and expectation that we'd like to see and all of our judicial system\nTony this was an amazing story of this one woman how do we know it just isn't this one woman out any more evidence of this being widespread happening ... scores of completely\nWidespread I've been emailing with public defenders all over the state and I will be writing about this nonstop for a period of time there are all sorts of cases and every time I find one I get three or four more calls from others I'm working on cases in Franklin County St Francis county\n... county Crawford county down in southwest Missouri it is widespread and there are fewer judges that have been identified as sort of the worst offenders a but it is something that is happening in lots of rural counties all over Missouri\nOr is it working its way to the Supreme Court or you just stay on as it is\nThere are three cases right now before the the the the three appeals courts in the state eastern southern west or\nA affecting different parts of the state and those three cases are all brought by Matthew Mueller who works for the state public defender and their cases on behalf of poor people who got minor charges but\nThen it ended up doing larger in jail time because they couldn't afford to pay the jail bill and and they're asking the court to declare that practice on last\nNight ... is it we got a text message here on the line and they're saying that these are the cases in states are not the county charges\nCorrect these are there any ... and my my one of my columns explained why the reason they county wants these people convicted on stage charges it is because they're they're holding them in their jail on state charges they get reimbursement from the state\nWhich means you and I our tax dollars\nAre paying for this and so they're double dipping\nHere's what happens there counting pills the stage because any state charge that you're holding somebody in your county jail on the state reimburse if it's about twenty two dollars a day but then they go ahead and build a poor person who was

just put a final\nCap on the woman with the video and the condo downtown St Louis\n...\nOh is she filming anybody know there was no the media probably look below my just wanted to see what the layout was\nSo yesterday late late in ... in the show I floated my theory that she wasn't\nIt wasn't a racist um wasn't racist that she was asking the guy first key fob it wasn't safety\nIt was that she was hitting on the guy\nAnd it went it was she was hitting on the guy and it went completely wrong and then um what happened was she got into the elevator where oh where do you stay and then\nHe was kind of like well you're a bit of a ... and so I'm not I'm a black man I'm not getting into an elevator with a white blonde woman in downtown St Louis who knows what can happen let me turn my video on I turned my video on she's like oh well where do you live follow me to my house right only to keep this on and then she got then then she was like\nOh my goodness\nI put myself out there and I was just rejected by this man ... he is going to pay\nNothing worse than the woman scorned so I was explaining this theory yesterday to a couple of people off the air\nAnd they're like no no no she was drunk and I was like yeah OK\nYou think she's drunk\nAll the more reason she was sitting on the guy [laughter]\n[laughter] I I Am not kidding I Am getting events this woman was hitting on this guy he was like a bit of a creep her black man I better turn on my video camera you don't know what can happen you don't know what she can say who wouldn't believe me if I got an elevator and she had a rich blouse\nSo let me just turn on my camera and let me go into my apartment\nThat's my story and I'm sticking to it\nI'm Still with you on that really so then he went racist with\nNo he didn't go round on just he just posted the video won't notice caption though was all about how he felt the victim of racism\nOh well yeah I'm sure this crazy woman was you know it was such a\nBad hit by her yes\nYeah no I'm convinced that discredited I just I and and it's just better it's a better theory I had a really bad something well and she if she was married to a black man so maybe they already has the inkling that she was attracted to a darker skin man\nIt was a quick rejection that they both that she picked up and so then she got all sassy and that's\n... you know she ... let's just you know maybe she was maybe she had a couple maybe you know maybe she was ... she was and I don't know but people are saying she clearly was drunk okay well if she's drunk and that\nLends itself to my to my side of the the argument we all do dumb things were drunk right and it's all of a sudden she writes once the guy was once a woman\nOnce a woman initially\nPut yourself out there and then the man rejects the woman you got to find some way to cover yourself that strikes me as a man asks a girl out\nThe ... hey do you wanna go see the images that she was like you were discussing ... leave me alone the guy's like well I I tried who walks away girls aren't that way and go hey would you want to go to the movie I usually like ... thank you very much but I think you know really well you're a jerk you're going to pay for that around here are gearing idiot\nYeah because women can't accept no as an answer\nTrust me you're on the drivers went\nCrazy speaking from experience that's why you know you want to drive over crazy tell her no\nI'm ... now but not all women know what I'm saying there are there are the ... there's eight eight eight the ratio of women I don't know what ratio it is it's one or eighty six percent or forty two point five percent but and this isn't I'm not being\nI'm not being sexist I'm you're right I'm I'm being anecdotal right there are when when you tell women know when when women especially a drunk on when women are told no they tend to sometimes\nUm lose control a little bit\nI won't fly off the handle\nA girl and the lights right\nNow I Know so I'm sticking with my theory and a lot of people were like no and then some\nAnd so I'm sticking with my theory and a lot of people were like no and then some people ... ... that's an willy willy doesn't want to admit it but that's a pretty good theory\nI Can't describe it as a theory got ...\n... ... it got totally blown out of proportion she then called the cops because I had to come and then of course she couldn't say well I was trying to hit on the guy and he rejected me so I kinda felt bad\nIt's got a safe is so right she has to do what's that that that's where I draw the line she can't say racist because that's a ... so then she's got to say no it's safety\nSee that's where that's where I you lose me because she has been vilified she has been smeared she might that change your name cetera et cetera if that were true what you're saying I Would have just admitted like you know what I hit on on that went badly [laughter] forget this yes\nYou would and I would want\nTo raise that no matter
