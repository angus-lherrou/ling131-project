S. you know every year thousands of men and women are released from prison and they need jobs and you know how hard it is to get a job it's even\nHarder for ... well the laughing their bakery in St Louis requires a pass felony as a condition of employment\nOr joined in Studio by to board members that the laughing ... Jackson is a secretary and George Lombardi recently retired as director of the department of corrections George started so many programs that to Missouri department of corrections puppies for parole and required all Missouri prison to engage with were sort of justice projects and we'll have more about that\nIn a moment but Georgia's nationally known for his innovative leadership and the feel of corrections so thank you both very much for joining us on the inside um\nFirst of all how difficult is it for a former offenders to find employment\nExtremely difficult from you know they have a cell phone number back and people really don't want to take a risk crude somebody like that\nSo even if you've done everything you possibly could while you were cars ready to take advantage of every program whether to sort of justice education substance abuse treatment when you go out with the best of intentions\nFor mom or you walk in the door to apply for jobs and they tell you that we don't hire felons it's very disheartening and if you have a propensity already as you've shown by being incarcerated to kind of say oh\nYou know it's very easy going to fall back into what you did before you came in most of the time it's going to be drugs or alcohol so it's very very hard and you\nGet such a wise investment to hire an ex felon\nBecause I'm\nBy doing so you keep her family together sometimes you saved that particular individual um what what people don't realize is that you don't\nThen that person may commit more crimes so it's a public safety issue in the long run for communities to take a chance in hiring extra for members\nWere you mentioned the fact that I'm even asking the questions sometimes can be like the end of an interview there is a movement in several states to get rid of that on job applications Danny by western up right exactly does it work is that the right way to go\nWell I think it is a providing that I'm\nThe founder that goes in there as honest about their background donors thing that could happen is they go in they don't talk about what they've done then six months later the boss runs out and out the door they're gone\nAnd they've got something to hide there was a sword of Damocles over the whole time anyway\nZach worded exactly so but I think it is a good thing but only if in fact the in the ... shirts with their background was and gifts the opportunity to explain how they're different now than what they were before they went to prison\nHas to wear is laughing bear bakery and how does it work well\nRight now we're located in a small business incubator kitchen in the basement is engineering Methodist Church that's at sixteen and olive oil and by the way it is ... days so if anyone wants to drive by\nAh we are selling pies are and how it works is that a quite easily people have been finding out if they are released from prison that this work a work skills ... program as in place for them and so we have a line of people waiting to to have a job\nWe hire them we train them to work we establish a work history for them so that when they go on to apply for other work they're they're more qualified and we pay them up as a minimum wage has well does it\nPay for itself or do you get outside funding\nRight now we're still in the early stages and so we are not paying for ourselves you know with every new ah ah\nOutlet that fills our products every new person that makes a donation where we're getting closer and closer to being south and there's like any small business\nAs exactly but laughing they're basically the nonprofit ... cells that some of the desert straps\nAs one of the first to a local uh\nOutlets to carry on products and they carry are their candy which is highly addictive and delicious and we're very grateful just drives for taking a chance on us and and we've been there for\nA little over a year to how many employees work into laughing Barry bakery right now I I think we have about five you know and we can't really uh hired many more people than that right now in our in our circumstances but uh you know like I said with that with every news\nSale and and every new custom era where were better able to fulfill our mission of hiring more ex offenders George\nJennifer mentioned some of the things that you've been involved in in the past before laughing better bakery why the interest or did they come from with us her story behind that\nWell you know I my background is I have a master's degree in psychology so I you know I've always been interested in\nThe fact that people can change if you give them the opportunity and after forty one year\nThe fact that people could change if you give them the opportunity after forty one years in corrections\nOr which correction started in corrections I've come to realize that if there was a characteristic meat missing in offenders\nHis compassion for others tend to manifestation of compassion witches altruism giving to others so if we can implicate\nAnd two people who never eat an added to begin with or the lawsuit because of childhood trauma and I'm telling you there's a lot of offenders who are in prison there had childhood trauma in their background\nYeah if we can do do that then I think\nKept a Journal of what he did and no one ever chickens and I don't I make a book of this where are you worried that people weren't going to be interested in this\nYes this is a book about botany about science fortunately it's a book about adventure also yeah and an added some energy to this very scientific\nAnd transformative work he was doing but this was a man who circled the world he went to fifty countries all of them by boat in search of exotic crops what year what time started an Eighteen Ninety four I went through the Teddy Roosevelt administration you know that's where the Taft administration all the way after World War one\nSo were these sanctions by president saying go find something delicious yes\nAh in the earliest days of America all the way back to Thomas Jefferson there was an effort to find crops in other countries are very few things what we eat today where in our markets are from

was\nYeah that rates are actually sterile there is no seeds so they can't reproduce naturally but ah but then how do we have more see and that's the way we called them we graft them take cutting Z replant the cutting that's why every great that you have is similar to the great you had last week it's also grafting and and cloning is why you have\nGranny Smith apples and Fuji apples and a naval oranges you have a uniform crops diseases watermelon yeah but you can expect season after season that are exactly the same\nBuys the seated grapes anymore\nI mean who wants to deal with that\nYet [laughter] you could buy them or they're around it's a matter of taste if you're making wine sometimes the seed provides a nucleus for ... for the fermentation\nTo his ranch of that to make your own wine from grapes from the grocery store and I used to I used to be elite to have see the scrapes an elite to buy seated grapes yeah interesting so limestone exceeds either so they climbed\nA lot yeah

extent of the government behind training who did it and and prosecuting them but then he turned around and and and seem to go after the media\nIt shouldn't be surprising at this one this is the president returning to a playbook he is not accepting any responsibility for the tone and tenor out and of course there is no responsibility to assign yet as of yet to anyone around these attacks\nBut I I think it's a moment that it's sobering for everyone and whether or not the president recognize it I think I think it is widely recognized around politics that something has to change\nThat this is not healthy that this was very close to being absolutely tragic an awful this week and then not just about threats but about actual violence and\nUnspeakable violence and I think it's a moment to to reflect on where we've come and where we need to go and that we are\nIn a political season and there are a lot of awful things being said or across the political spectrum but truly no need to know use and and no role whatsoever for this myth sort of a ... actual violence and threats there oh\nI think the the what about is a more the both sides is around looking at the other side of it is a is a totally unproductive exercise and I think if anyone were to say I am totally blameless them is a bit in the conversation and\nIf you're going to see a change I think it has to be a universal

yeah um did you see is van they the guys van yeah with all the Trump [laughter] now let's let me be clear here as I say um [noise] I couldn't believe for a second that\nI'm ... that the Democrats quite frankly had anything to do with this I also still believe and this is going to play itself out this guy is a mentally ill or there is no doubt in my mind anybody that would even consider doing something like this is mentally ill\nHas nothing to do with that and I think it can uh I think it would flip me out if I had as thin as some of the things that they do I like I could probably do the snakes on me that's\nNot a big asteroid I can I picked up snakes that I've had snakes wrapped around me and so and that's ... that's fine I'm not a big fan of the water modest income and downstream toward me I'm not a big fan of uh you know playing around with a poisonous snakes like the snake ... or whatever those guys are the snake is you know the guys at handling of the ...\n[laughter] and I think as the religious guys that they I Know I Know not a big fan of that um\nWhat do you ... what do you think about the just this kind of off on the side but what do you think about the ministry where they use the snake charmer ...\nSo ... uh one first of all I'm never going to necessarily you know suggest to anyone that their way of practicing religion is crazy short of\nIt causing serious harm to themselves or others and there have been bad so that was number one number two is the whole idea is that God's going to\nTake care of you and yet we see time and time and time again\nPeople that are practicing this dying from state bites ... now I think others will say well apparently they didn't have enough faith know nearly for more than I Am yeah and so that's I again I I guess I

that I thought oh yeah yeah that's important\nThat's one I can grab hold of I mean I've watched them and I've even watch the\nDocumentaries they have on TV and it's it surprises the hell out of me as

I\n... as you once you get to an adult then you have absolutely every right in the world to act accordingly you get to choose and I believe that people have the right to choose to deliver die [noise]\nUm I really bothers me when I see sometimes the kids yeah um because they haven't had the opportunity and um without offending anyone I I mean no offense but\nUm you know we we always say God will provide yeah he provided for doctors and he provided for all kinds of knowledge and so you don't die right it is and the plants and the and that's and different things that we make 'em medicines out of and\nUm you know I think God's right in there with us so I'm against that\nBut if you choose to do that but just with the kids that always hurts a little bit because you know I look at that kid

going to be abusive to his wife anymore I just stopped but he never said look I'm I'm Sorry\nFor abusing use and that he just gradually stop beating there but\nHe's still ... still treated or wrong but never abused dirt and eventually at the age of fifty sixty years though may be searched treating her with a little respect do you think that that woman\nIs like yeah I Am so happy in this relationship or do you think she holds emotional baggage\nI see where you go on and she holds the emotional baggage ... so way I'm saying is way like eventually there was no slavery eventually we

Munich Casey treating people rice skills you can stop doing something\nBut you can't expect people they always say just apologize people always want closure there was never any ratio closure and it was like four hundred years of treating people like this is that like what we\nWas fifty years ago fifty years ago who couldn't ride in the back of the bus so it during my lifetime right you're like whoa hey\nWe're okay when I was saying and that was ready to go over it but no that's not a natural it's not a natural thing to get over it so whatever it is whatever you feel I don't like I'm not\nLike I Can't waste that negative energy like I just teach my kids like do you get pulled over you just got to be smart\nAnd yeah I hate to tell you live in a suburb yeah as soon as I moved to the

changer here let me because I don't want to turn it into your comedian you're here to make people laugh but this is very interesting I I like your your your analysis I really do your analogy\nBut you you brought it up about the kids what do you tell your kids I mean you're living in the suburbs you um you are not a living in the ... you are a professional yeah now what do you tell your kids when it comes to um ... their place in in this world that we live in today\nOr what I was the first day it's ground one night I tried to teach them about the\nN word and the history of ... and I tell them that uh it was a word that uh that makes people uncomfortable but it was also were that was forced in vocabulary it was it was literally for us\nThat was forced in vocabulary it was it was literally for ...\nAnd we didn't get like hey we're [noise]\nWe let you go you're no longer slaves and in there and black people like we did more to fly like it was forced enough vocabulary so when people like you can't say that word you can't like you can't do that like it's an uncomfortable thing but I tell them I'd go\nYou have to do if you're going to use that word I'm not telling you to use their I don't use it like that as your call\nWhether how you use that word you have to deal with the repercussions of it if you use that were around your white friends and your wife ... says if you have to deal with the repercussions of it I treat they were much like white people treat defined\nChina [laughter] I only bring it around my close friends [laughter]\nGet out of friends who are\nThat's right I don't use it around like sometimes I use in and jokes\nBut it was very like I don't see any transitions I'm not saying that just to say\nA lot of comedies do that so now I just say you have to deal with the repercussions on it and if you want to say that word and you put him in your music and this and that\nYou want to sell albums you want to be mainstream but you don't want people to sing the lyrics that's not natural ... like I like like I Believe in hold myself I don't it's not natural to say\nYou treat people a certain way you don't apologize and you want things to just disappear is not ... it's also not natural\nFor the you want now want people to say the N word and you put in ... and you want people to buy the albums but then you don't want them to say the word\nIt's just you can't have both so I'm trying to get to the point where I don't let that were have that much power over me mhm\nBut then again I Know when people say that word to me negatively they are saying that it's like spending in my face ... like there's hate involved in it it's it's it's different so it's like yeah\nLike what do you do it's it's like nothing is perfect you try to be the best the best person you can be but there's a lot of awful people out there and then you got to survive I didn't have the game when ... when are we getting\nOut of the electric car gross you got some baby\nYou know that's

so\nOut here is ... live on the big five fifty shades ers\nAll access is Jay cancer Halloween is right around the corner\nAnd one of the places that has lots of interesting sometimes scary in our minds a creepy crawly things is the St Louis ... it'd be blue in the zoo was going on now through Halloween\nAnd so we thought it would be interesting to bring in someone who oversees the decree peace in the ... the things that we kinda shiver a little bit when we see Dr ... is the curator\nOf invertebrates and he is the director for the center of native pollinators conservation and one of the great things about the St Louis zoo is the insect carry him and a doctor a speed ... works as part of the zoo in the insect Terry I'm welcome to the program\nThank you for having me so let's start I'm just what the definition of invertebrates\nInvertebrates are those animals are technically without backed by so vertebrates are the mammals birds reptiles amphibians fish\nI'm at a few other smaller groups which most people don't see it birth or most of life on the planet those things actually keep them a planet running those things which we cannot live without\n[noise] I guess to go all the way to the single ... are they invertebrates or if I go out to starting\nYeah technically you know they're not in verb it's ever ever so I'd have to be multi cellular okay maybe that they have more than one cell so ... means damn ... are not really regarded as invertebrate\nStill would I say spiders and bugs you does does that coverage gentle\nSpider insects slugs worm\nCorals a ... a jellyfish all those sorts\nOf things [laughter] All right so a lot of those can be found in the insect carry them down there at a at the zoo a really cool place um and I encourage everyone to get down there to kind of place where you are I don't want to see insects know you want to see these insects how long has that been there and describe it a little bit [noise]\nSo we've actually opened around two thousand so we're next year will be our nineteenth beer and existence um we're actually rather unique because most lose do not exhibited vertebrates the way we do or they may have a couple of here and there we actually have a dedicated ... average staff [noise]\nSo we're actually one of the ... and the country which has a dedicated building staff\nOr education conservation and research effort is devoted to invertebrates so\nSt Louis who is unique that's another reason why you want to kind of come um and the the St Louis do because we are one of the few out there\nAnd then I said this before in the show in segments on the zoo in otherwise when you count on one hand the things that make St Louis grade the St Louis zoo was one of them for many many reasons and as you just described this to do is is unique enhanced things that you won't find nearly anywhere else in the world\nUm we're speaking with ... curator of invertebrates tell us a little bit about some of the let's start with the Halloween e creepy crawly I Know you have some cockroaches down there that I've seen their gas they looked like maybe I'm exaggerating but the sides of football's\nWell that is a bit actually that's\nActually very common with various fares so often times you know people call up and say oh I've seen those cock roaches used as a ... foot\n... of spider the size of a softball\nUm we don't have those things around here but fear tends to inflate it I remember as a kid I remember saying I remember this patron at a three foot\nWingspan well they don't but that was just a little bit of a fear when I was a show\nSo we have a ... lot of different types of ever see the number of different types of spiders that we have on exhibit from ... some of those actually being threatened in the wall like the red meat translate from Mexico to those that we actually might find around here like the brown reckless we always try to maintain a brown recluse on exist\nWealth and doesn't touch the mosquito is not going to do anything right but you also have to think about the other bees\nButterflies other beneficial insects which can be affected by those same insecticides\nIt's far more effective look at where those mosquitoes are laying their eggs so it's understanding their life cycle so we need to understand more and more about these species how they live and that's going to be much more effective at dealing with if we have issues with control\nBut right now we're saying\nWhich some people are calling and infect apocalypse that insects are disappearing studies done in Europe and studies done here in the U.S are finding many insect populations are decreasing of paper just came out looking at the rain forest\nSpecies they're also declining and then those species would treat on them are declining whether it be amphibians birds et cetera so we're seeing things which um is changing drastically our ecosystem and we rely very heavily on all these and verb it's as I said from the beginning\nThey're the ones keeping the plight of running so whether they're pollinating our food pollinating or the food for other animals whether they're cleaning up whether they are the food for other animals to keep them alive\nAll of that as an connected and as we started pulling on each of these different strings or the ... of these in a relationship Web before pulling out the reverse of a plane\nWe're going to see problems which we may not have even thought about\nWe are talking with Dr ... he is the curator of invertebrates and the director for the center of native pollinators conservation at the St Louis do\nLet me ask you this when my daughter calls me up and says there's a spider in my room I think oftentimes our first\nReaction is is killing or there's another bugs or there's another insect is it OK to kill a spider\nUm for me I actually just catch him and put them up so high and my wife used to be very afraid of spiders or she's gotten over most of her fears and for something like the jumping spiders she now finds\nThem to do that but if there is a spider\nWe find in the house for most other species they've kind of inadvertently got in the house I wandered into that yeah so they actually do far better outside we usually have you know a cop for ... or something and just scoop them up and put 'em right outside okay there's really no need to deal with it\nNow for certain things yeah there you know we can be annoyed with various types of flies mosquitoes but as I said they're simple way is even dealing with those for example with mosquitoes\nIf you're bothered well being outside of very simple method of\nKeeping you from being bothered is to set up some sort of fans mosquitoes are actually very poor flyers so if you have sort of a fan if you're on a porch with the ceiling fan of conception other fan um there are also some very simple techniques to reduce the breeding population and some types of mosquitoes like the house mosquito which is\nRequires really no effort and no chemicals\nWhatsoever so there are ways of controlling these where it's not a problem with you and so he can start living in harmony that these other species which we all depend on and that's what we

all the way out there to the to the county line am all the way up to the crickets and\nSo they are both in here tonight as a we have a mark harder in here quite a bit every other Tuesday and he's brought mark with men tonight we want to talk about a number of issues local issues but one of them\nIs Westlake landfill\nAnd we have had lots of folks on the show we hear about it all the time and frankly I think unless you're living up there and living day to day it starts getting very confusing\nBut we should be more aware of what's going on this isn't a um an issue just for those folks to live right next to the landfill we all live in this area this is an area issue when my kids were playing um baseball over a bridge didn't it was an issue for them\nThat is right over there at the airport the whole St Louis county area\nThat's all right Jay this is really something that affects our entire region\nOr the wind is going to blow every direction right and there's a lot in the air that screen coming off that site over the years and it's all of our jobs to pay attention to what's going on that site but Jay I'm here actually with some good news alright\nI sat down with the EPA big group of is back in the last week of September ... as they announced their final resolution to clean up the landfill or at least get Seventy percent of the radioactive material out\nA earlier they put out a plan that just dug up the top sixteen feet of soil we've always known the most potent radioactive material on that side is sitting on top\nSo the EPA went through and\nFigured out where the most radioactive material is that at the ... and ... ... per gram level to ... the cars dirty polluted stuff that could affect people's health and racket\n[noise] [laughter]\nUm so they're committed ... they're committed to getting that material\nOut let me stop you just for a second marks for people like me to Jay only have a ... thirty six thousand foot knowledge we heard there's radioactivity or radioactive material up there and tell us what it is and how it got there just briefly\nI back in Nineteen Seventy three a Barry unscrupulous company makes radioactive material at topsoil and shipped it off to the landfill is clean filtered\nWow and that's how it ... this isn't the or the old the Nineteen forties we're building the bomb that\nIt is in the ah the old the Nineteen forties we're building the bomb that\nSpread exactly Manhattan Project legacy waste the same material but leaked in cold water creek and poison thousands of people up in\nThat area so it is the same material and they kind of looked at mixed it in and put it in the great that the ice\nAbsolutely I Would love to go back in time and find it a person responsible for that from the ... corporation die so we know that\nIt that it's there the testing and given 'em so is it mostly on the top in the top soil or hit ... down in\nThe top twenty feet and so there's areas are only going to dig down eight feet there's areas are going to dig down a full twenty feet\nWell for this site for this project we have the money okay so it's as you know I have been\nAnd at the ... got to spend years trying to get their money back from the responsible parties afterwards they'll do it at that time but they had the money for this product that's good as far as the administration just chop and the whole department of the EPA that's never been there a plan what they their goal for our EPA is to restore it to its original purpose\nGet these contaminated sites cleaned up that's why the ph their prevention of polluted air and\nCleaning up our sites [noise]\nLet me ask you this then um\nDo you think that the administration at this point has been too tough on the EPA we were here oh a lot of red tape we don't need these agencies the three letter agencies when in this particular case for you when the sun and because of your hard work and wanting to get it done\nYou know hopefully lives are going to be saved you know it's always yeah for everyone else it's a waste of money but for me right here do this was money well spent\nHighly kind of balance that the\n... what we need is just simply focus now you can never be too tough on the EPA can never be too tough on these agencies to to make sure that they're actually spending the money that they're given for the purpose that the money given to\nLocate outcomes are um you know kind of cost and benefit had been a an a cost benefit analysis has been performed but we're not just doing things for the sake of\nDoing absolutely you know one of the big concerns that I have I've got a framework it up the Hanford a musician side in Washington he's been there for years they're spending a lot of money up there nothing has been cleaned up yet\nSo you want to find ways to earn money I get out the federal government myself that it really is all there is a lot of busy work going\nAll right I put you on the spot there are I think the good news you have brought it is that uh for this area if things are going to happen now my last question then we're gonna move on to maybe some county issues uh with mark Carter\nWhat do we do again getting back to these people what can be done for these folks in terms of a ... you know what's already happened to them is their money I sugar I'm certain there are good lawyers out their Jake the fat man they're probably already rounding up a a you know clients but at the end of the day\nYou know one of the things government can do is we have access to the government to medical um you know kind of technology we have access to a assets and resources to help people that have been exposed is there anything that's been talked about along those lines\nAnd that is where my role is going to be coming in this next session because we're not talking about how we can get these people for a move from that situation because honestly even even if the risk has been lessened there still risk\nWhen we ... we put in a big I'm a runway shirt removed half a bridge in a way\n... ... ... over noise yeah I'm getting about the trolley a better you\nKnow like when is it yeah Dale you and everyone else but my point is yeah if we wanted an airport runway will move the whole town chair or if we want an end Ga will buy up three hundred houses these people have been sitting next to you've been sitting next to us the radioactive waste dump and now what are you going to do for\nWell first I'm gonna ask everybody who's listening who lives in that area who's been affected by the with their health on this situation show up a week from tonight at\nFive o'clock at the hearts of St Charles banquet center where the department of health and senior services are going to go through this one hundred and ten page document to just torturing\nFurther and if there are still alive right they'll get help by say ...\nThat people showing up one week from tonight to express directly to the people looking at these numbers how this has really affected their health\nRight it's not just a hundred and ten page document absolutely real people and that's where I marked with decent ... thank you for it\nWell that's right ... thank you for your work on this issue is so important it's been going on for so long\nUm gosh I remember when the thing first started on fire and we just kind of said sure and then ... ... as around the fence and while I'm good news [noise] All right mark Carter\nSt Louis county councilman\nA move what good news do you bring to the show to see you know it's always\nGood news [laughter] vacation pictures to go through that I'm no good news or the government still functioning\nAh we ah the government uh the console one hour lawsuit in court and uh uh the county executive cannot hold back our budget for the legislative branch of our government\nAnd for the first time the legislative branch of saying it was kind of government has been recognized as such and not just as a down their department of St Louis county government so that's a groundbreaking case uh through a judge in through a court case that we have so uh that that will set the tone for\nFuture budgets and so on right now come November first we will get our first peak at a executive stanger budget\nGoing forward for Nineteen Ninety or for for twenty Nineteen and we want to make sure that we're gonna start having hearings department by department hearings to make sure that that budget reflects the will of the of the council and the people in St Louis county\nWhere ... we've seen a lot of people leaving county government and top positions didn't the department of health the head of the department of health leave we\nHave a lot of a department heads that are being ... of those positions being filled by a deputies ... and uh we've got a number of people leave a starting from the department of health the department of public works and transportation I'm a number of ministry to post a so\nIt's there are a lot of it as the economy you know they uh some other jurisdictions may pay more than St Louis county we've never been on the top list of high highest paid jobs I editing level and um but we've been a steady employer and we have a pension for many people so\nUh in bad times everybody flocked to the government and good times or watch it ... back there you know so that's kind of the transition we're in right now tonight we heard\nA lot of ah employees of the county are asking for a pay raise a we haven't done a general pay raises for probably three to five years depending on the position\nAnd because of property which is the money for the police and for a ... safety uh those workers got races and uh the people that are not associated with the police are not associated with the courts are not associated with\nUh the jail [laughter] they didn't get a race and haven't gotten a raise in many years so\nUh those folks are starting to come to our meetings on Tuesday nights to say hey we want a raise and make sure you put it in the budget so what do you think about that as a kind of counseling it's one of my goals because we've been listening to us or for the last four years that I've been on the console\nAnd I'm a but we also have to look at everything else uh right now we're probably because the economy is so a heated up\nUh we're probably at the maximum amount of revenue that's going to be coming into the county this year maybe next year\nIf the economy takes a downturn our revenue goes down right has a sales tax and we're so dependent on sales tax and property tax so as long as everything's rosy out there that money keeps coming in and keeps coming in at a higher rate 'em but once things turned than we all got to start tightening up or boats\nWe we I think this time around we are going to really force them to the discussion\nAnd the conversation dealing with what is the role of St Louis county government\nUm we can't be everything to everybody Andrew in state government can't be that way county government federal government so the discussion has to be okay what is it either the private sector can pick up\nA ... can pick up or things that we just don't need to be doing any more um and we got to look at that because everything we look at it\nFor a\nGetting involved in involves salaries involve people in assets and a lot of money spent so we I think it is interesting I mean by what we want to do\nIs sure you look at different municipalities in what they do and we just assume that everybody does the same thing but a few months back the big discussion in the city of St Louis was trash trash trash we are a lot of our trucks are wording we after after all over the place\nYou look at a lot of other municipalities around the area they don't provide trash pickup that's a decision if that if you watch trashed picked up at your house we will contract with one or more folks to make sure that there's someone there but you're going to pay for that\nI think it's a decision you're right that if people have to decide what is it that cat a government you I mean they should obviously fix roads because they are county roads and they got to keep the police force going and\nI'm a few other things but then you say and then what at what point do we want everyone else to kind of do that because you might do it\nThis is a this is a big deal for you it's another place key most chop house and it'll be good yeah\nI'm waiting it we may get a chance to talk with Bob zany here we were a\nA kind of ran a little long with the uh the folks from St Louis county mark my teeth and and mark Carter thank you to them although as they were leaving they she barks at you know I saw your buddy what's that what's your buddy's name the bald head guy you know the comedian guy that uh\nAnd and he goes you know any I'd forgotten it Bob ... has been the informant\nWith Matt Damon a he has a uh he plays a lawyer by that day it weighs a lawyer in the movie the informant Bob zany who gives us the Zaidi report every Tuesday a hopefully we'll hear from him today coming up in the ten o'clock hour\nArtistic director of the repertory theater Steve Wolfe will join us and then after that Raphael Esparza will tell you what are the odds on the royal baby being a boy girl twins\nAre I'm sure there's some names you name it if there's a whole if there is a bet to be had there taking\nBook on it or want to know because there's a conversation I had someone I didn't know that um maybe it's taking bets on soccer's a circus doesn't [laughter]\nYeah that would that it wouldn't surprise me one bit although I'm I I don't know I guess if you can bet it you know the book I mean Megan she is American and we do know circumcised over here well I I don't know that I don't know whether they do or they don't over there I don't do it over there and she\n... who told you this [noise] ... yeah well you know it was world wide receiver ... way too much time in the men's room it over there they Rick said hey ah jacked up something to that good that's great\nUm eh yeah yeah she went and saw a movie tonight probably can't talk about it but you've got to talk about everybody\nThere besides Lynn she might have been like\nYeah I'm a court case was on assignment or watching a movie so that he can report back as part of max and movies can do to Portland to Thursday for me to\nYeah to me there ... I don't want to you know you probably have a contract with max and movies that prevents you from disclosing anything but actually do\nActually do what would you say if you need a movie review on Thursday night I got you there was three hundred people there to\nGuide [noise] what can you say what movie it was the Halloween [noise] which is I'm not a remake is it is it just goes to the very first one a sequel you know that makes it Halloween to than\nTo say to read to hotels like it's part of our way but the sequel was noted that no it's not if it's a sequel it's Halloween to\n... or for

name like make something\nMhm he's back but but he's a map gives me he had the ... the original market Mars person back in Seventy eight where the guy who played them that's the about the last time I saw that movie when it first came out and I said I got a speeding ticket on the way home from that movie\nWell guess what do you go see this one because it shows up right after that when I get I get a speed\nBut said it says I wouldn't know where to begin or end it since it's been since Nineteen Seventy eight\nOr a good thing then this dodging the movie would definitely help you with that so you probably remember there's a lot of cops their primary you got a speeding ticket to know if you're already been a\nLot of cops in New Hampshire I was coming home on a back road and I lost my license because I had just got my licence Seventy eight I was a Seventeen just going to get my driver's license and they hadn't had it long enough so when I got the ticket I lost my license for two weeks that

P. C. uh the things that we talk about\nOn this show we're going to be very general they're not going to be specific ... they are not intended to be specific financial or legal advice and we encourage all your listeners to speak to their qualified professionals for specifically ...\nVery good uh you know it's it's funny you sold me his mind how time flies a Tom are you sold me a life insurance policy it does it it can be twenty twenty five years ago now\nI don't know if it was quite that long ago by Twenty years there was a while ago\nYeah and and you know I Want my money back I didn't die\nGavin pay and all that money and I never died so I haven't been able to use it to okay well\nWe'll talk about that right off the air okay let's start with the first topic I'm ... ... people my age or my mother in law just recently passed away a Howard's mother just recently passed away\nA were at that age where those that's happening and we end up collecting something sometimes it's a piece of property sometimes it's money sometimes it's who knows what it is a ... and she\nThat's fine but often we don't know what does that mean are there any tax conflicts\nThat's fine but often we don't know what does that mean are there any tax consequences do we need to report it I'm a so maybe you can walk us through just in general ideas about\nThat okay well for one of like a lot of attention has been given in the past two adept taxes this this is specifically\nWith federal state tax right now the federal estate taxes all that at ten years ago if you died with a an estate over a million dollars you would probably be subject to an estate tax today after\nA Obama increase the the ceiling quite a bit on that and then Trump did again a most married couples can pass eleven million dollars or more without any state taxes\nNow let's talk a little bit of why we're on this topic um I Do a little bit of a safe planning work some wheels things like that and most people are\nVery surprised that the things that they own typically they can pass without even having a a will everyone comes in says oh my gosh I'm so worried I say well what do you have well I you know as a house I said you can indeed the house in such a way that\nUm you know that'll pass 'em to your children or whomever you want to leave it to a upon your debt your vehicle the same thing is just a matter of having a death beneficiary death beneficiary designation\nUm life insurance the beneficiary it goes right to them all these things and bank account you can put someone's name on the bank account or a beneficiary of transfer on debt cod all of these things can be done even without using\nUm any of that the typical estate planning documents will limit trust you still want those but um you know if you just can't do that there are ways to to get part of the way they're\nRight well there's really no such thing as dying without a well because if you don't have a well the state's got ... the ... and in my in my business that's always kind of a joke frankly I have a I don't have any children uh\nI Do not actually have a well other than the one that the state provides for me and it frankly I look through it and it's pretty much the way I've really I've done a job but the thing is\nMost of my assets have beneficiary designation where it's going to my life so I uh uh what what what's left over after that is not substantial enough for me to worry that much about it now you're an attorney and you might want to um tell me why I'm wrong on ... and maybe that's a whole other conversation\nAnd and it could be but you're absolutely right I think a lot of people are surprised by that that uh you know most I Would say most Seventy five eighty like you said um maybe even Ninety percent of what you have can be passed of who you want it to pass to I'm just through a beneficiary designations round you are\nNot by the way I Do want to say that that is terrible advised not to have a welfare anybody with children yeah anybody shouldering or a second marriage that's horrible advice trimming it actually was right\nAnd then I Would absolutely agree because I tell you I'm never underestimate ah what money will do to a a family dynamic right uh well but that's another day another conversation let me ask you this Tom Martin [noise]\nGive me your eye contact information because now people are saying a wild this guy is so smart and do so much I got a call him um I got to give them where do they find you add\nUp probably the easiest way to email me at the time and Martin natural by us you can as my website Martin financial by us you could call me on the phone at three one for seven eight seven seven for for one\nOkay now now they've got that written down because we are going to continue on I have another question first year under the new tax laws\nCorrect yes in typically at the end of the year people might be saying well it's time I remember I Would add up all of the ... the solicitations for\nUm contributions and charities and we'd been kind of make some decisions because you wanted to get them in um a lot of that doesn't matter anymore there if it does for me you want to be um generous but from a tax perspective\nFor the average household ... doesn't matter anymore does it she huge number\nOf people are taking a standard deduction where they hadn't before but uh the standard deduction is larger for one and the dachshunds are more limited you cannot deduct your state and local taxes any mhm I'm so huge number going to be taking the standard deduction\nUm that means and I'm not sure how the charitable thing plays into that kind of caught me a little doll\nYeah ... but I think as I understand there's still that the charitable there but I mean when you start looking at those numbers that you know it's kind of a bar that you have to get over um you know if you're just the person that was you know given a few hundred\nGet over um you know\nIf you're just the person that was you know given a few hundred or a few thousand even a but that's not pushing you up and over the bar it's you're under the standard deduction right\nIt most people ... their taxes are going to be much more simplified 'em and they are probably going to pay less most people um we didn't get down to the point that the\nPresident promised us where we can do it on a postcard as far as if you're just not the thing is if you're a business owner you have no idea how advantageous tax bill that\nWe'll see I Am a small business owner is the lawyer that's you know I'm a single member L.

acquainted with Mr Nichols when I read his article oh about a week ago in the Atlantic titled why am I leaving the Republican Party\nMr Nichols thanks so much for being with us\n[noise] it'd be wage a

as a back in the early nineties\nThat's incredibly impressive I watch the show if I get half of them um and you know I I feel like I got an brilliant but uh that's pretty impressive I'm going to read something much it's towards the end of your article and then I'm going back into it okay\nBecause what it says I spent nearly forty years as a Republican their relationship to began when I joined a revitalized GOP that sought self not as a victim but as the vehicle for lifting America out of the wreckage of the seventies defeating the Soviet Union and extending human freedom at home and abroad I think that\nAh describes many people who are my age your age that joined the Republican Party and have been part of the Republican Party for all these years now you have indicated in this article ... do you are leaving the Republican Party why is that\n[noise] well\nThe first thing I should emphasize with I don't speak for them or college or the government or anybody else you're just my own view\nUm I I because for one thing I was going to be a Republican you know when I joined the Republican Party at\nThe end of the Nineteen seventies I'm as we went into the Nineteen eighties I turned Eighteen and Nineteen Seventy nine and ... you\nYou're right I'm sure you'll remember those those were tough days for America\nAnd there was no way I was joining I grew up in western Massachusetts I was out in a you know an industrial area Massachusetts factories and mills and there was no way I was joining the party of Ted Kennedy and Jimmy Carter Mike Dukakis that just wasn't happening\nI think it is I I felt like the Republican Party was living up to its promise and for some years after that uh [noise] uh trying to rein in size\nKind of exert ourselves in the situation that we would shake hands with the Kim Jong moon 'em and say\nYou have a wonderful guy yes then love letters to him\nOr you know when he was asked about this when the president was asked about this on sixty minutes any and finally he just got to get me some just want to be what it's going to be ... you know\nThey I mean it's just weird behavior and not again this notion that well we're making America great we're strong America First\nThis is this is craven collapse to people like Kim Jong moon given Kim Jong un summit mhm and and you know treating him as though he's the equal the president and let's just

happen\nWell it happened when president decided that he didn't want to be investigated about I mean something\nAh and again you know talking to the president's use language about the FBI that again you and I are old enough to remember what was the kind of stuff at the most radical anti\nLaw enforcement left layers would use about deep state and the wall let's FBI agents and the the the scoops up the CIA and the intelligence community the rogue intelligence community\nThis is all the rhetoric of the far left not of American conservatives and I think it really has been a disservice to people who you know have paid a price to be members of the law enforcement and the intelligence community but not is not an easy job\nAnd and you really do kind of pay a price in your life to be a part of that community and the attacks by the press or just shocking to me I mean I really just astounding\nYeah I I don't think that I've ever run into um people that I Would describe the way the president described some within the FBI were of some of those agencies and I'm a lawyer and and I do see them I don't get it now\nI Want to make sure that the people that are maybe more in favor of the president does say well what are you going to do go over to the Democrat you don't um you don't pull any punches with the Democrats either you say I'm not ready to uh to board that train\n[noise] no and in fact they um when I wrote in that piece in the Atlantic about the ... the Democrats during the Capitol hearing I Believe the word used was extra ...\nYes and I look it up\nA you know that that the Democratic party is a I think the Democratic party is headed for its own crack up shortly in a way Donald Trump save the Democrats because I think they had they elected Hillary Clinton their

on the American left that makes me deeply uncomfortable makes me makes impossible for me to be a Democrat um I could have got a Democrat forty years ago when the Democrats where I come from working class family I should say that\nBy the way down in much Democrat\nYes and I could have my parents were Democrats until the late sixties like a lot of people who felt the party left them after the late Nineteen sixty move too far to the left so the idea that I Would become a Democrat is just laughable I mean it's first of all I they don't represent what I Believe and and they certainly would never have\nMe given many of them use ... still [laughter]\nSo ah you know that's just not going to happen I'm just part of that kind of center right a part of the independent\nVoters in America now and that ... you know I wouldn't dare Democrats I Will happily vote for um the Republicans I Would still vote for although not in this election I think the Republicans really need to lose this next election badly\nOr to kind of maybe shake them out of whatever they've fallen into but um I plan to engage in the great American tradition of ticket splitting for the rest of my life\nYou know Tom

Shakespeare production and the premier is Mick back\nAnd spin like shadows and\nThere's this is not your I'm the seventh grade they actually was ninth grade that's when most people out of that yeah it is not your ninth grade Macbeth visit\nIt certainly is not it's not even your Shakespeare and the park and they think\nIt is that even close let's talk about immersive theater you've been on before the last one was hamlet is that right yet that that ... the last time I was I right that's right and we talked about immersive theater but tell us once again\nBut right now and we're talking about a nurse or theater but tell us once again what is a immersive theater\nSo immersed in theater is something that I'm a group of friends and colleagues and I sort of dreamed up in um I Would guess somewhere between two thousand five two thousand seven\nWe were trying to come up with ways you know a lot of us were working on Broadway off Broadway and we've been kind of look out into the crowd when the show's over and we would notice that there was no in our age in the audience and it was so we kind of\nLike when I give a sermon a church and I looked up there and everyone who's my age but no longer than [laughter]\nSadly that and you know we started getting worried for the fate of theater and we thought you know how can we make our stories more enticing more exciting more emergent\nAnd personal for people who are maybe our age and what we've\nMade an idea so they can get her us either you're young you're both young but give the the listeners an idea of when you say our age because you know I'm like you to know and are\nMuch worse than you in and out and people I mean people in their twenties people in their thirties or forties or even talking about people up to their sixties but it's a different type of audience member it's not the type of audience who\nNecessarily has a subscriber to get to somewhere like ... or so we'll see both on last night yeah my buddy Steve yeah um yeah it gets about\nRe invigorating or the youth to have a reason to go to the theater and to reach out entice them and engage them in a way that they can grow up with that in their culture here in the United states certainly in London or some other places maybe that's more woven into the culture but\nIt's exciting them and getting them out and having them yeah absolutely\nYeah and that and there's it's just a different different method to do that I'm with an immersive theater you kind of blur or it in our case remove the fourth wall altogether so you don't go and you said in the theater get a ... sort of wait for the show to happen\nEverything happens once you walk in the door and it's an experience it's not like you're watching the play it you become a part of this world and you become invested into characters to inhabit that world in in the world itself and you see so many parallels to our own lives\nDepending on the story that we're telling and in this instance were telling the story of Macbeth or telling it in a very fresh\nIt I suppose you you don't want people join in you know ... bum Russian you up ... actors right right yeah and there's less they're invited to write a certain amount of his first patient and then there's disruption yeah Jay\nDon't [laughter] except\nIn certain moments where we get that you can send to Jay then you may you may tells you\nTo us no means no correct um what about somebody who is somewhat adventurous but doesn't really you know\nDoesn't want to be pulled up onto the stage and made part of the production can they still enjoy it can make participate be immersed in it without having to you know I I just want to participate I Want to experience I don't want to be an actor\nCompletely there's a few tracks and this where uh you'll get sort of ... singled out or one on one attention but we're reading that from the moment you come through the door and we're talking to each other and we have hand signals of this was the person tonight\nOr ... or re Malone early just want to watch that route want to be drug allergy to me it's like I get it I Want to say I really I\nYou know ... there are others who just are me\nMe me me me exactly and they're always there every every show because how they can look at you can look at your body language I tell if you wanted if you want to be of a deeper part of this story or not\nWe even have a whole safe word in a safe gesture if it just in case right we get it wrong almost never do word banana [laughter] well maybe it is that I don't know [laughter] you're going to say this on the
