you are\nVery good okay so ah let's talk about this I'm a current event it's heading north\nWe're thinking about sending up through a five thousand troops south at the border let me ask you a quick question because I haven't seen a lot of reaction\nPolitically about this from people who say you know we need to give them refuge hum let's talk on that ... you know and we're near the midterms I mean we can't be any closer were about a week away\nUm what kind of political implications does this has\nWell and a lot of it you're probably going to hear beginning tonight because the announcement was only held about an hour ago where all the details came out of exactly what this is going to be but\nIt's fifty two hundred active duty troops heading that way and the the timing on this can't be ignored I mean we are eight days away from the mid term is the caravan won't be here for quite a while because of slowly they'll go I got twenty five miles a day at most in there a thousand miles away\nThat they no doubt about it that this is something that the White House can use as look what we're doing here\nBut we haven't heard a lot of reaction from Democrats no doubt they're going to be jumping in and saying whatever they're going to say but\nThere is ... there there's some nuance to this whole thing because the headline is definitely that there are troops heading to the border but because of the coma taught us\nThose troops can't do any actual enforcement and this is the same thing that we dealt with when the national guard way than\nThere are there as a supporting role so a lot of it is kind of smoke and mirrors so that may be though is in the caravan get word that there are troops on the border but don't hear that they can't actually stop them that this is Jeffrey border patrol agents so\nThat the troops will build fences and won't put up tents and fly helicopters and do a transport to move the border patrol agents around but it's the border patrol agents who have to do the actual enforcement\nAnd Alex I'm Glad you brought that up because whenever I heard this news I just kept thinking let's visual going to be five thousand men and women can't scanning\nAlong our debate at least he'll be there as long as\nThey don't actually interact or do any law enforcement role is going to be different though that these troops if they are okay to to carry a weapon normally when they're deployed they are authorized to to carry a weapon in this assignment and and normally when the national guards men and women go down\nThere digging ditches I mean they really are when we went along with them they're digging ditches for fencing and you\nKnow building building there doing work they don't have a gun over their shoulder and they're they're not typically arm these folks are being told they can bring their weapons and they're shot out they could shoot back but but they wouldn't have a first interaction with the with any of the illegal immigrants trying to come across but\nStill were ways away this is right now forty five day deployment the troops are already en route they started even before the announcement today this is being called operation faithful patriot\nTheir route that attack this then they will go to Arizona and then they will go to California got it seemed to be skipping over New Mexico but but they're going to begin by doing their work in Texas where the first round\nYou know and I know that this is kind of a rallying cry for increased border protection and or is there anyone that feels that these people should you know have free access to entering the United states I mean I Can't\nMay I ask are you referencing my my world series pick that went around by\nBut that was mine as well [laughter] but I think it was more than just the ticket was wishful thinking yeah you know the best team in baseball wanted no question about it I don't know\nIf you guys have seen this kind of circulating around

well people thinking pictures she got the Bengals but you know most people when they grow up their parents tell them\nIf something's for free as you catch right it's generally true it was a gorgeous it's an inheritance ... well another usually catch\nRhino [laughter] you're right there\nAnd you win the lottery which\nWhich you have to explain to me why all of a sudden everybody now will buy a lottery ticket when it's seven hundred million dollars but when it's a hundred million they won't go running\nTo buy and yeah you you know it's ... ... people to call it silly to buy you know you're just throwing your money away are now in line to buy a ticket you know and I don't understand what the brake point is it's like Cuba same odds\nAnd what's the difference between winning a hundred million and and and a billion and all I'm saying it I Know what the difference is nine hundred million [laughter]\nBut um but yes it's true I mean we spend all that money where your lifestyle\nChange if you have a hundred million burned down six hundred\nNow right scratched change a lot from my lifestyle right now [laughter]\nNo right to change a lot from my lifestyle right\nNow [laughter] ten percent and the nine hundred difference none I thought a lego your lifestyle or will you just\nGo out on dates for free meals so that's not going to change my shoes are too big today so I pay she's\nThe fed and I sort of surgically have bigger feet maybe I don't think I Do [laughter] so ... free\nStates it's the same I'm Better rates so people say wait a minute what's the catch on that there really isn't a catchall there was a pretty simple math formula okay we're talking mortgages mortgages which you know they can be fun it can be fun\nYou know my wife always falls asleep in the show because we have a show not o'clock every Sunday and she says oh it's called mortgages and more with ... and then when we start talking mortgages she kind of like all this is boring shouldn't worry\nPlus you get to spend all the money so she's concerned about is actually spending it or not you know saving it sounds\nAs she's listening not to I'm Sorry to hear that you have the same we have the same domestication me I mean we make it they spend it and that's what we did was we eliminated the commissions that we paid to loan officers my officers in overland which is a lower budget been ... ... you know\nNow when you say a commission to loan officers I totally get than um than that immediately goes to the\nClients customers in the foreign paying all the closing of them got it so you get the same or better rates and with no cause and\nSomebody says and despair question to ask so how do you make\nMoney but we sell the lawns on a secondary market like most sure institutions do yes they're Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac ensure the government ... just as good a very few are held the pure hell leader as good as doing business with bank of America hair or any other institution\nAnd by doing that if the quality of the loans that we start or can we make enough money to pay the closing costs and just make enough money to do it now\nIf you own a mortgage company you're obligated with Dodd Frank which was this law that came out to not long ago not long ago you're obligated to pay a fixed commission on those loans that your loan officers originate well if you don't have\nLoan officers to pay commissions too you can take that money and pass along the savings to the customers so we built a model\nDid you hear that weight I Want people to get that\nI Want you know and and I say that it's because of the stewards American mortgage is a proud sponsor of the guy Phillip show and so I Want you people who are in the market for mortgages to hear this\nOut of the owners mouth okay now it may seem like well that's called out there for a bunch of people in your office you don't need a bunch of people selling the citizens like you know he's not trying to churn out these these ah [noise] ah mortgages but the benefit is\nTo you at every level I mean it's so if you get a lot of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more you get zero closing costs because you don't have any expenses stripe\nWe're so there is no title fees no appraisal feet every every day I got a call first of all the people you know advertise my cell phone number is some people can't really than they actually answer the phone but you know that's what I Would want in your place\nAnd then when we do is we pay all the closing costs for them is not nothing added no title fees no appraisal the nothing so in essence it ends up being free\nAnd we just built this model based on what Dodd Frank offered to be more competitive and as a result\nWe become I think the single highest producing\nOne officer your climax on our insurance I Am a vibrant am I talking points here okay right say they're like oh yeah yeah do you have a nice message here a while but now you have to listen to heart so it's the highest price somewhat plus I'm trying to come\nHome lately I learned I get back in ...\nHe says I guess ... bag a mortgage from age OK yeah tester comic by [laughter]\nPeople to make phone calls to

they were wearing\nAnd yet\nSo I'm going to backtrack a little bit but we know that bumble is up for the most part recognized as a dating app but recently it's increased it reached to promote women or to find friendships across the country as well as networking and so I'm\nIn an effort to kind of make sure that people across the country understand these different capacities they have now hired a different\nPeople to execute events that reflect those scenes business and friendship and so next week we're hosting any jak called um how creative dynamic women balance career in life and Laura gr is going to be one of our panelists and so what\nWas it was when I reached out to her she's like\nA ball and um I probably felt a joke like that and\nUm and so yeah I think that's why I'm here to to to make sure that people in St Louis know about this event and said that they can\nCome and enjoying the events is next Thursday one week from right now where is that cost yeah okay so ... is that rich Carlton and Clinton is ten dollar a man it's from seven to nine pm there next to over twenty five what other women are on that panel and what\nReally are we going to the\nCounty I don't have a

was really what are some of the strategies that you try to include in your daily life to\nTo to feel normal but still\nDriving a thriving in your country is a great question huh I I don't know I'll have to figure it out\n[laughter] really oh my gosh\nWhy why is bumble doing this now in St Louis yeah yeah um\nMe because bumble was always just seen as a dating app now that it has those features of friendship as well as business and networking we have to bring a B think that is to let people know like there are other options it's not just empowering women in dating but in those other places\nI like it I'm a I'm going to need a new panel [laughter]\n[laughter]\nYeah I'm going to say no\nYou introduce Dr ...

really wants to do on my\nKey places that I'd like people to look up is bumble St Louis on Facebook and that can be a perfect place to keep up with the events um obviously that break is where they can purchase a ticket and so they can take that in and find out you know bumble and clean and even right and so those uh\nThat should allow people to find the tickets one thing that I Love about bumble and for those who have not use that it really has women making the first to know if you have to both match do whatever you're searching for it but then it's up to the woman within twenty four hours\nWhoever you're searching for him but then it's not a woman within twenty four hours to contact that person and say hey I Want to kind of station with you at the same time once you do get in a serious relationship you have to have that conversation saying are you going to deactivate your abs and at that\nPoint I have not been on bumbling number in mind when I open it back up what am I

thank you very much okay\nJust wanna make sure we're okay from Washington All right sorry about that anti I was totally unprepared for you but thanks for coming on the show appreciate it let's talk\nThat makes [laughter]\nHello bigger that so so let's talk about this uh uh we know that there are ah you know somewhere I've heard different numbers between two and four thousand people\nThe Hondurans that are making their way through on tour is over the border into Mexico or maybe some people are coming up through believes going northern routes I don't know\nI'm at this obviously is a problem\nCaravan reaches the border here [noise] um\nThe problem it to this caravan reaches the border here [noise] um what are what is what's the country or what does the government trying to do to stay in the last\nWell let's get back to work or to Mrs Clinton Trump is very upset\nAbout that or\nAny immigrants are coming over the border illegally and correct doesn't seem to be particularly thrilled about the ones that are coming illegally but when he's what he did was uh he issued a statement saying that\nUh he threatened to close the U.S Mexico border frightening to cut off a financial aid Central American countries and he even said you know he's willing to blow up the U.S Mexico trade you just made if Mexico doesn't do something to stop people from coming now if you look at a map bears Honduras\nGuatemala and Mexico so Mexico loaded up two plane loads of police to seven twenty seven Boeing jets\nFlew him down to the Guatemalan border and said ah we're going to use these guys stop migrants from coming in to Mexico so they never make that long trek up to Mexico peninsula up into the United states\nAre extraordinary fast action by Mexico responding your tweet mhm\nAnd and so um you know I Know the president has made these are good [laughter]\nI don't know if they're grandiose statements before about uh you know closing the borders but but you know he has\nActually put into effect some real change in other areas people tend to believe that they have this may be something that comes to fruition I think he's trying to shock these other nations in just saying this is your problem don't let it become ours\nWhen it comes to the borders I don't think the ... the president's ... off because I was one thing you can take the back of people do anything and everything you have\nTo secure the borders of the very first words out of his mouth when he ran for office and he truly believes that a a it's either a problem or the wedding political large but either way\nHe stood by the sea of what the evidence that buys his guarantee that Mexico is going to pay for the sport ... knows he's asking for tens of billions of dollars of us taxpayer money to pay for it it was something more has claimed that somehow Mexico pay for one day with Mexico just got a\nLaugh sort of luck with that Mr President\nWhen you're speaking and he found an ABC News ... Andy as you mentioned meringue fast action by next to kind of send the police officers near border has the president tweeted seems next decode get about their responses please\nI don't know that he has I ever\nThem up on his Twitter feed ... hours he was talking about other things as he left the White House there were two uh although one of the things are actually that happened at the White House kind of blew up today\nAnd that is a John Bolton and the president's chief of staff John Kelly apparently got into a profanity\nLike screaming match outside the oval office today a report from a number of people in the in the west wing basically about this issue that I'm a God ball claiming that person bill sudden\nThe secretary of homeland security wasn't doing our job in protecting the borders and of course John Kelly who used to be the homeland security a director of\nThe secretary of homeland security\nA curse and Nielsen was his deputy and she became the head he was defending her and it appears that the president was on all sides so there seems to be a big brouhaha about this particular subject in the west wing today\nAndy uh I Know that the president likes to lay blame that the footsteps of the Democrats [noise] I have not seen any statement released by them as a whole that addresses the criticism uh this morning of this this tweet have you seen anything from them\nNow but I knew I mean the price of a basic blames anything he doesn't like other Democrats including a you know he says well you know the Democrats are or for having criminals cutting into the country well there is a Democrat in Congress has ever said we want criminals to come into the country\nWhere it's almost impossible to find a Democrat to say what the president says they do say which is we want to open borders no protection do scary slit while they're there is a Democrat I Know is that\nWhat they do say is we want protection for the dream or children who came here after no fault of their own that they want a immigration reform so that\nCompanies are this country who routinely employ a undocumented immigrants or or people who are on visa status\nTo let them have some pathway to citizenship if they want to get in order to make sure that they're not arrested just for coming here to work and provide for their families but go\nAny any kind of paint a picture of what this so called caravan is I mean are they coming by training and a bunch of buses I mean uh in kind of who are these people um I you know I Know the president is calling a lot of them criminals but is there any of the nation are approximate number on who they are and what their motives are I mean I assume looking for work\nOr if it's if you're a bit rich for the president they call them criminals you spent the last two weeks saying that weren't telling people or people are guilty before proven is that when it came to Kevin on the show so\nI'm not quite sure how you know the criminals and was they were all just let our drill and put on cars to drive your primarily families on people who are up ruining their lives they are afraid for the last card to find a better life and here they\nAre you there was one ... just a bunch of people that are all it looks like a caravan but they're all\nDifferent people from different cities are trying to escape the oppression of their country and come to the United states\nAnd and I know that ah the president obviously is been focusing on the midterms uh there's no question that you know this sort of\nWho's balls ... football\nThe Broncos are playing

R. A. Z. E. K. dot com\nWelcome back to a guy Philips rock to you I feel attack waterproof foundation for fair Katie R. S.\nHaving a very very gas ... regularly Anna ... caliber you've heard it talked about Kiki are at an entire station mindedness you'd ask her breast cancer awareness month as a woman who knows other women who have received\nThis diagnosed as I think it's just fantastic that Katie are actually doing that and when I was told how can you find someone to talk about breast cancer I instantly side of the amazing doctors that we have right here in St Louis area and we're very happy to have Dr around those with us today how are you sir I'm wonderful\nThank you so much for having me here Laura and guy I'm\nThanks to our ... were very happy to have you left talk credentials first off first of all talk about this back issue I've been all about breast cancer guy deal here back later the doctor and you\nAre with the Washington University school of medicine of course here in St Louis any do a lot of research at fattening Cancer Center\nYes I've been at site when Cancer Center for eleven years\nBeen a proud St Louis in for fourteen years um I have two children who loves to be here\nCut we are very happy to happy hour why breast cancer\nSo when I was a doctor in training for cancer I decided to focus on breast cancer because it affects women from all walks of life and with proper treatment most women with breast cancer will do very very well\nWhen you are meeting a patient and you realize that she has ... ... what is that like you don't record that diagnosis that\nIt's very it's a very tough thing for a woman to hear\nA breast cancer diagnosis is often a huge shock women are scared they're worried they're wondering how this their life can change how many how much time do they have what's gonna happen to their families so the first thing is to give them some calm reassurance say\nMan what we've got a lot of good options for you let me take you through them\nWhenever you do give that diagnosis I'm sure you start thinking about all the research that you have ... what is some research they are working on right now\nSo we're doing a lot of research about the genes and types of breast cancer so breast cancer is not one disease and cancer can be broken into different subtypes and there are three majors subtypes of breast cancer hormone receptor positive her too positive\nThere's just subtypes of breast cancer harm on receptor positive her too positive and triple negative we found through work on the genes and breast cancer that there is a common area between the Harmon receptor positive and her two positive breast cancer\nWhere we can bring some of the drugs from her too positive cancer in to a specific people that have hormone receptor positive breast cancer and have them work really well\nDr um how much does heredity play in a breast cancer and for those women who have not had a a breast cancer incidence in their lineage how do you explain that\nHeredity a place a portion but there's the vast majority of women more than Ninety percent will have a breast cancer that does not come from their family members\nAre there certain groups such as the Jewish population from a of Eastern European descent that have an increased risk of hereditary breast cancer but um\nBreast cancer as a whole probably Ninety percent or more is non inherited\nAnd so let's talk about a prevention of course you know we hear that word all the time um and and I think as women in family should encourage the men and their families to have their prostate checked\nA man should conversely do that for women to make sure that they didn't have those those breast exam so talk about the preventive measures that one can take a to at least a detect hopefully avoid [noise]\nYes so at this time in Cancer Center we recommend annual mammography typically starting at age forty for average risk women now across the nation there's been some controversy do started aged forty do start at age fifty I think it's simple is to say started aged forty once a year [noise]\nUm you can discuss it with your doctor if you've had a case of cancers in the family than maybe reason to start earlier but again discuss it with your doctor\nSo or just a moment ago you were talking about how they're I guess there are different forms of breast cancer correct yes so every woman's treatment but 'cause I've been lucky enough to not in my at least in my immediate family have anyone that's been a you know how to deal with us but so I guess every woman's a plan to beat\nCancer or breast cancer I mean it is much different well there are categories and so it's important to figure out which category and individual patients and so\nWe look at what is the subtypes the estrogen receptor positive hurt too positive and triple negative and the pathologist tells us that we look at what is the anatomy of the cancer how large is the cancer in Nebraska how many lymph nodes are involved those are all factors that play in\nOur talk with Dr ... and the guy Phillip show and lawyers got another question\nFor you I Want to brag about you know let that because you did receive a huge grant five million dollars for you tell us what you are going to do with that money as far as research goes\nBy a whole bunch of mega man has shed yes go ahead and be from the department of defense really stuck out to me [laughter] yeah\nIt's a ... surprises me to no end that the department of defense funds breast cancer research but I'm the department of defense or funds medical research across a wide range of a medical problems\nAnd some things are obvious such as that are better or militarily related such as head injury so our vets need treatment for head injury and that's one big thing uh but there's other things that are not so obvious in connection with the military um that's a\nKind of a ... of the congressional budget process but the the department of defense gives 'em up close to a hundred million dollars for breast cancer research they've been doing that for close to twenty five years and it's made a lot of difference\nOr their leaps and bounds in in treatments now a or discoveries of ... what are the latest discoveries for women in in breast cancer because you know we read all the time about fascinating things you're doing and I'm Wondering if you do leaps and bounds or if it's just incremental\nOh it's the pace is of progress is incredible so about two days ago the fed the food and Drug Administration approved a new drug for breast cancer it's a drug\nFor patients who are ... to a ... mutations that inherited foreign breast cancer last year there were probably\nA two or three drugs FDA approved outcome new to the market for breast cancer we've seen a whole category of drugs that didn't exist prior to twenty Fifteen come out and there's three drugs in that group for doctors and patients to choose from ... are moving quickly and really positively ...\nAnd St Louis is a wonderful place or cancer research isn't that\nYes the Simon Cancer Center in Washington University are very active in their ... a cancer research programs that breast cancer programs we see I'm\nProbably close to a thousand patients with breast cancer each year in terms of our research we're thinking about what are the genes in the breast cancer and how do we target them in a clean way\nThat doesn't bombard the woman with chemotherapy or radiation\nGo to the
