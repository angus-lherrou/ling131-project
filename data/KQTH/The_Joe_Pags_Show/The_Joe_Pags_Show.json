P. told Fox Business\nBetween the insurance industry and the reinsurance industry together those two industries have\nHundreds of billions of dollars of capital in surplus so the good news is and hopefully it will be some solace to the homeowner impacted by this storm is that the financial stability of the insurance and their insurance industry's is not an issue\nMeanwhile Florida governor Rick Scott has ordered the state's top insurance regulator to freeze property insurance rate increases for Ninety Days and to rescind for Ninety Days all policy non renewables are cancellations\nAmerica's home builders remain optimistic the latest National Association of home builders Wells Fargo housing market index mine's the builder confidence in the market for new single family homes rose one point in October ... confidence level has held steady since June one thing that's encouraging builders be moderating price a lumber\nComing up and a half an hour help paid off is your city Steven back to you\nAnd we have the latest information on contract signings for you today [noise] the national association of realtors reports that in September\nPending home sales rose compared to August no not a big jump only a half of a percent but still an increase however year over year pending home sales fell one percent\nAnd ... in the face of Paula Jones now that's just scratching the surface on Bill Clinton's the party of all of the sexual miscreants can they pretend now that they represent the interests of women when they what they mean is bimbos\nSay that the Democrats the bimbos must be believed we believe that the ... it's a little change from last time around because the last time around they were ... they were slaughtered they were ruined they were wrecked they still can't show their faces in public because the Democrats did such a job on\nPlants ... four one K. key th two sons news and talk [laughter]\nDave Ramsey show\nThat this is an unusual RadioShack listed a lot of\nA big talk radio fan big fan of some most of the guys that are major national figures I Know some sort of friends um\nThis is just a different place here people being real\nSo people actually are nice to each other [noise]\nSame Randy shower let a new one on one in four one K. GPA Susana Susan talk oh [noise]\nMe today connecting you\nBack again now with our special show scary thing about those parts of real estate that my view the shivers like borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars more putting down roots\nAnd when my first question to Elizabeth was are you scared\nAlways always Colleen is it is always a scary\nMost ... in front of in the air too\nSo what happens in Columbia, Missouri on Halloween Night\nTrick or treating you know trick or treating happens it's also the last day of October so like many communities the last day of the month is very popular day for closings with um homeownership and and so if people get ready to wrap up those mortgage payments and they move into a new home\nAwesome [noise] some people across America have thought about buying a home but it's a little bit scary to them should it be\nBefore I bought a home I got home ownership was scary to me any repair or anything that might have to happen to how it was always two thousand dollars no matter what I was if it was a roof for it so it was a leaky faucet I thought it was going to cost two thousand dollars\nBut that's not the truth and certainly you know sometimes homeownership is scary because you realize not only are you going to now be responsible for your monthly payment to live you're going to be responsible for the most ongoing payments and you know realtors that's a great place where you can use your local realtor who can connect you with\nThose experts in the neighborhood the plumbers electricians it takes away a little bit of that fear 'cause sometimes not everybody has those connections and they need to a realtor cannot make\nThose when you make a really good point because you're not only paying the mortgage also paying for maintenance but it's your house and you can maintain it so you can make sure it's done right\nAbsolutely and and maintain it the way you want to I think that's another one of the great benefits is now it's your home and you can do what you want to with it and you can add on a deck if you want or you can put that picture in a while or you can decorate the outside for all those trick or treaters\nAnother scary thing is borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy that house for some people that just terrified I'm\nSure that's one of the very first thing that's going to happen when you meet with a realtor you're going to have a conversation about\nThe mortgage process and you know and in a row trees are going to recommend some lenders in the area who you can talk to about what that payment means how you pay it back what happens is you know you feel you can't afford it or you or you can't payment and how\nTo manage that process but it's their long term payments and it's you're investing in you\nKnow you're not investing and someone else and with interest rates being lower rent being higher it's a very good thing to chicken too because it's very likely that you might be able to pay less in a home and investing yourself in someone else\nAnother thing we're here to visit some mostly young people are afraid to get tied down they don't want to put down roots they want to stay free and that's why they don't buy a house how about that\nPart of one of the values of this country is freedom and being able to move and do what you want to do but in order to do that it does require resources and many times those are financial resources the best way to build wealth\nTo have the freedom to do what you want to do is to own that home it's an investment in yourself and your future and so\nUm it's a great way to really establish your financial portfolio for life\nAs a matter of fact as one young person told me the other day they're going to buy a house but they still want to live in different places all across America so at one point dove rented out and they'll move somewhere else solid\nI mean certainly want to check with your local realtor find out about the communities there are communities that rent better than others and so but it ...\nWith your local realtor find out about the communities there are communities that rent better than others and so but it becomes an investment portfolio for you and we are seeing that you know as people want to continue to move and home owners today\nAlso become traveler and are renters in property for a vacation days so you get to have the benefit of both\nThere is a tough one ten years ago the financial markets crashed some people are afraid to buy a house because they're afraid that's going to happen again\nSure that's where your local realtor really is important to have a conversation 'cause every market is different and every market has recovered differently from that financial crash certainly there's been different changes in lending that are going to help mitigate that for the future so there had been some rules and regulations that have been put in place to try to avoid that\nWhich will help our home buyers and that but you want to talk to your local real chore about the conditions of the area where you're considering the by whether it's a first home or a second home you know our prices increasing it the inventory low or high you know that will give you more of a sense of a long term investment picture\nSo finally if someone gets passed all those scary things and they buy their own house we need to remind them that one of the most comforting things ever to sleeping in the home you know\nIt's what everybody wants to do at the end of the day\nWhen you're tired when you're excited you want to go home but it's also the place you get to celebrate so many memories get to celebrate birthdays and dinners and you certainly get to celebrate hopefully all those trick or treaters you come to your door and and the costumes and the sun and the interaction with the neighborhoods and that's a great fun thing about this week\nWell happy Halloween Elizabeth ... men and all

T. bank millennials outspent every other generation on Halloween to the one\nWe will spend an average of about a hundred and eighty dollars on candy costumes decorations and other random duty

scary\nHomeowner I wanted to talk about the best and safest ways to prepare your home for Halloween 'cause there's no reason Halloween can't be scary and safe\nZones grudging let's hear\nFirst for

little as three percent down conventional loans through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac\nThat is awesome Rob and so the thing that you bring to the table but is so valuable to homebuyers all across the country is that wherever you live in America chances are\nThere's a down payment assistance program right in your area and people don't know about and that's what downpayment resource does it tells people look here and you might find money for your down payment\nIf they're eligible for one program we say that most of those attached wires are eligible for somewhere between six to eight programs

infamous which trials took place in that year some three hundred twenty six years ago two hundred people were accused of practicing witchcraft and\nTwenty of them were executed\nBut the years since I've been very kind to stay on because now it's a great town and a booming real estate market it's location just north of Boston and right on the water is a top destination for homebuyers but do those

which believe it or not is a real religion that people don't realize\nYou're kidding no no and we have a lot of a story than and things that cater to that population here so it is a big draw\nIs that right so a typical homebuyer comes to your office and says I'd like to see what's available in our price range in Salem, Massachusetts how does that conversation go does the which thing actually come up during your talk with them\nYou know what comes up a little bit to be honest with you but most of our history is based on merit time and um you know our Eighteenth century architecture\nI see so tell us a little bit about that what what I find if I was looking for a home in Salem and if I was looking for some of the local attractions\nWell homes and Sam I'm can range anywhere from things that we're both at sixteen hundred wild\nTo you know converted loft in downtown to more residential neighborhoods with split level homes\nI see and you mentioned its maritime passed I imagine you have a Lindy interesting seaport area\nOh it's absolutely stunning and in fact I don't know if you realize Salem was supposed to be the capital of Massachusetts\nIs that right it is but um fortunately our harbor wasn't deep enough\nInteresting so as we mentioned Pam Halloween is this coming Wednesday when you see a lot of visitors to Salem because of his past involving the witch trials\nFor sure [laughter] they're our tour buses throughout the month of October but Halloween day we can easily double our population if not more\nIs that right just for the one day\nSo if I come there and I'm

and following the girls and\nThat is fascinating yeah [laughter] so Pam do you like working in a town with a Halloween themed to it\nFor the most part yes because you have to realize people come from all over the world to visit here just for that\nNow I understand your husband owns a retail shop in downtown Salem called the barking cat that all about [laughter]\nHe does sell cat and Don products\nOh I see so it's a pet supply store it is\nSo it has nothing to do with Halloween or which is or black\nCats know although that is mandatory and sailing by the way is it really yeah you have

thanks for joining us today thank you so much happy Halloween you to pay them Mickey real tour with the Keller Williams panicky team in Salem, Massachusetts [noise]\nComing up on real estate today just applying for a mortgage make you want to hide under the bed\nKnowing yourself going into the transaction can shine some white or those dark little corners of mortgage lending scary things might live and come out to make an uncomfortable\nThat's coming up on our special show scary thing [noise]\nBut first it's time for our smart home technology report\nSingle one of his does every single\nDay right there in our very own homes charging our smartphone it's an important topic because after all so much of our lives and our real estate happens on our bones these days so you need to keep that phone all charged up\nBut you know how phones keep getting better and better well part of those improvements involve charging improvements that can help make that daily chore easier and faster than ever\nThere are two types of new charging check you need to know about one is high speed charging the other is wireless charging we'll talk about both of them starting with high speed\nThe company Qualcomm came out with what it calls quick charge a few years ago and many of the more recent phones have it basically a charges your phone from zero to eighty percent in about a half hour now that's really fast\nAnd then the speed slows down to protect the battery and the rest of the charge takes about sixty minutes\nNow not all phones have it but you can find a list of the ones that do that the Qualcomm quick charge website just search quick charge\nOkay so quick charge is great but you still have to plug it in right well right but that's another area where the tech has gotten better\nThe old us be many conductors word the industry standard but you had to plug them in right side up or they wouldn't go in\nToday's a USB stick and actors can be plugged in right side up or upside down and they worked just fine same goes for the very latest thunder both connection called ... three\nOkay so that's high speed charging now wireless charging wireless chargers don't plug into your phone at all rather there cradle or desks or square blocks and when you get home just put your phone on it\nDone no plugs no cables just put the phone down and let the charging begin\n[noise] it's not as fast as quick charge but it's so easy\nWell knowing yourself going into the transaction can shine some light do those dark little corners of mortgage lending to a war scary things might live and come out to make it uncomfortable you know if you know who you are as a borrower know where your finances are no what you want to know what you can borrow\nYou can go on with confidence and that won't scare

while for one occasion the H. two sons news and talk about in reverse [noise]\nThis is real estate today in your home Nineteen your biggest investment\nI Know with our special show scary thing our annual tribute to Halloween which is this coming Wednesday [noise] and of course one of the scariest things in real estate is coming up with the down payment now in our first hour\nWe talked about new research from the Urban Institute about barriers to homeownership and how coming up with that down payment is so frightening to some people\nThey don't even try to buy a house but those fears are largely on founded because sure some people are not ready to buy but many who are they think they need more money than they really do\nAnd amazing as it may seem most people don't know that their state or county or city probably ...\nTwo and amazing as it may seem most people don't know that their state or county or city probably has a down payment assistance programs ready willing and able to help homebuyers get into that house\nLet's talk about that now joining us once again is Rob crane with the organization down payment resource Rob launched downpayment resource to connect eligible homebuyers an eligible properties where it's hard to find a down payment programs Rob thanks for coming back on real estate\nToday it's great to be with you again okay so Rob\nLet's talk about those down payment assistance programs\nFirst of all it's not just for first time buyers every time correct\nCorrect and I say that for two reasons one is that\nPart of that is because the definition that's normally used for first time homebuyer is that you haven't owned a home in the last three years so you could have gone on in the past and\nNot own a home for three years and for these purposes you still need the first time homebuyer requirement also there are in our database probably about thirty six percent of the programs do at any first time homebuyer requirement\nInteresting and another thing Rob about downpayment assistance programs you don't have to necessarily heavy starter wage to qualify I understand that people can actually be making a really good amount of money and still get the assistance\nThat's absolutely correct a lot of it has to do with where you live because the uh ... household income limits on these programs they not only the area for the program the program\nBut they vary from state to state city to city region to region so if you live in high cost areas the area and median income is going to be higher than low cost areas so depending on where you live you might be able to make over a hundred thousand dollars in your household\nAnd still qualify for a lot of these programs\nThat is amazing so Rob how to our listeners learn more about down payment resource and the down payment help that might be available to them\nWell they can go the down payment resource dot com and ... button that says find programs and to her about six or eight pieces of information about their\nHousehold\nAnd then the festival tell how many programs that are eligible for an a to hell and about those programs\nAnd where to find a money most importantly right that if I doubt you're eligible for money you better at a pass to get there and and it's just some well tell him that they'll tell them not only where the where where to find the money we were the participating lenders participating education spiders and so forth\nI see so Rob let me back up just for one minute if I learned that I Am eligible for down payment assistance they don't just write me ... all that happens during the mortgage application process\nExactly exactly so it's really important when you're looking for a home to find a lender as a lender before you go out looking for a while actually that's that's the first step because you don't want to get excited about home than trying to figure out if you go forward forward it or not really\nA but when you're talking to different lenders thing that you want to be sure and do is ask them what downpayment assistance programs they participate in because that I did lead to participate and even the lenders that do\nDon't necessarily participate in every program most large metro areas have dozens of programs\nDon't necessarily participate in every program most large that dozens of programs so really find out first when you talk to the lenders can do it with the programs\nThat is great advice and Rob I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about\nThe latest report barriers to homeownership by the Urban Institute and also the ways that down payment resource can help people find the money they need to put down in a house thank you for being here\nI guess David it's always great to be with you I appreciate the opportunity\nYou're very welcome Rob crane with down payment resource connecting eligible home buyers and eligible properties with hard to find a down payment programs [noise]\nUp on real estate today

how are you trying to than the fan on thinking crowd around your show\nCertainly thank you how can I help\n[noise] okay [noise] so I and follow your plan for like a couple of months now I had the emergency find that I'm working on baby step too good on that night and I had made progress not a ton of it's on our best\nAnd I ask you this idea of a chronic illness and I still work fulltime I Am not letting it take over my life good and my question is how do I I check 'em for my deductible\nAhmed ... recently I recently switched off ... started again I'm also the chronic illness you're going to hit the adoptable every year\nRight um\nIt's ... the guy that thing on the go it's not they don't have and it's not life threatening are you going to double every year\nYeah okay so now also they look at what what is the nature\nIt was very ... because it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced God help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing it what it's going to cost you in a year right right and you just put that in as a budget item so let's just make up a number\nOkay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand or the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three\nThousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know a\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands ongoing frantic medical when just call you call it chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up\nAnd leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something now yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so so thanks for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I don't\nLike the way I can make that happen so what I've been hearing have [noise] I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you can do right now on what I'm I'm hoping over time on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we going to get an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where\nOur identity ended that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand on that I make\nI don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition actually switch to a job I had more flexibility on some in a fee for service division as opposed to a salaried position mhm and I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck and\nI knew he had a device on Monday on line you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with that\nGuy gets them I'm living with a roommate I paying nine Seventy I rent it give us a lot on and I do that from ... from ...\nTo them and what is the nature of the debt student loan\nBig fat is everything credit card I also because they can hear it I was trying lot of holistic thing mhm on medical and then a student loan or most of it if I can get it out there that I have like a total of sixty thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things in the food pantry not

grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work as an end of the dead as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going in a pair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\nHere's the thing you're either going repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming [laughter] you're told me that that's why you're called yeah yeah yeah\nI mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying ... actually I've got ... how do I prepare for it you save uncover it so\nNow that's our short term long term we gotta get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your

yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\nAnd all the way we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can get later\nOn but what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of ... of all I Want to get your input on it we\nHave our ten percent fight it but we want to live without thinking about putting data and given back to the church and didn't have an extra five percent and kind of giving it to\nUm other charitable organizations that we believe in that are about doing day or a ... you know when the crisis mission is that we're trying to looking at trying to give what we can to people who need it\nUm but if she's on the other hand want straight ten percent a church and then you are or what we don't what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to get it from the church and\nWe had a big argument about high then yesterday I was\nI was as long as you know the the definition of dies the definition of the time is when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus reaffirmed given the New Testament\nIs tent it literally means chant the word means tent\nIt doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twentieth it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to tie they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker a plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave\nI'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you I Love ya [noise]\nUm you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to to gifts and all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is a time of the tens of your income evangelicals have taught him\nTestament and Jesus reaffirmed within the New Testament is a tie a tenth of your income evangelicals have taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years that that private is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top [noise] before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise]\nSo if you want to biblical answer your wife wins the argument [noise] that's the biblical not your wife was argumentative she was correct biblical re [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nOrder to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nNow where we have about a hundred and five thousand dollars in debt and fifty thousand and cars twenty two thousand and other debt\nLike credit cards and all that so one Osama includes cars yes 'cause the cars\nFifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's the ah about eight thousand on mine and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income [noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty ... a year where did you use to mount the old drum\nYeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why now I'm In\nReal estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day in real estate ... I've got to choose a house is sold ... things and ... by the end of uh the second week of November\nSo what is your projected income for the uh the that's six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand by the end of the year and that was what does your why didn't make of the ...\nFifty a she made a fifty one thousand\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you use to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out\nI'm only selling to houses that between that long span 'em and everything is she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [noise]\nOkay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for poor and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows sad\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape but if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just give them hell that cancer thing there by yourself and those groups that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nWhen we're married and and in ... in health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish and that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her is that we needed my my truck is for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these qualities of course we'll have\nIf I Can't get what I was asking for what you what what I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to is I'll get a car cash and then she sells her car and then what have at least one quarter right now [noise]\nMm well I don't know I don't ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're gonna move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay offs and other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are pending or clothing by then\nYeah and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are any or clothing by the second week of November everything should be close to St\nLouis just two and three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today\nI Would sell your trial today and I\nBut I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's your room mates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but uh but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of debt making about a little over a hundred but instead has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car\nBut if you are not wanting to do that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble then\nShe's not willing to\nJoin armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you have a marriage problem\n[noise] okay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit you run around and started selling mama's car is not weigh a good way get mom on board\nHalo so let's try that other approaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income is going to go [noise]\nBut if it that and then you might be looking at a different career and she's going to be looking at us on our car too and you get hurricane car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this mess cleaned up\nThis is the day Ramsey chef [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of\nIt they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share ... team they\nHave offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution\nThey've accepted thousands of timeshare owners this year alone they're the best in the business because they simply have more options\nFor exit than anyone else it could be a long process but there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit team is so confident in their acts of service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight for for\nNine nine nine exit and schedule a free\nConsultation eight for for nine nine nine ... or timeshare exit team dot com\nChris plants show morning moving on to a blissful future where a target market decides who's guilty of news innocent and we've had all these Democrats\n... brand and Mazie Hirono and\nYou know there is no presumption of innocence there is no due process they don't actually believe in the constitution of the law they don't believe in the last I also don't believe in human decency and basic human decency and then when I say they don't believe in basic human decency I made that I mean that they really don't believe in basic notions of human beings and see the ...\nDon't believe in basic human decency I mean that I mean that they really don't believe in basic notions of human beings and see the ... most of us were raised by her mother is and sometimes by our fathers or the idea that you'd be fair and a decent honest truthful that what matters is the truth or\nNot we use ... drew political snakes\nUh and uh I guess those days are those days are gone those days are behind\nThe increase blanche LA collected on one boy one K. key P.

[noise] [noise] Thirteen\nI these were sent to various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives in material they give off sheet and energy through a reaction to heat shock\nOr friction now we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nThat is Christopher Wray the head of the FBI and welcome back to the Lars Larson John First Amendment friday evening we'll get to your calls in a moment at eight six six eight large that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven you can send emails to talk of Lars Larson dot com well the authority\nOurs that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven you can send emails to talk of Lars Larson dot com well the authorities have finally caught the suspect but it was one week one week since the bombs began to be intercepted\nThomas rescue and joins me now the president of CNBC protective been investigated room in a highly decorated former New York city police detective a detective rescued welcome back to the program\nLarge thanks for having me\nSo how did they get to this man so quickly what's behind that\nGreat police work great police work but the NYPD the joint terrorism task force which made up of FBI agents in NYPD at New York state troopers and the Federal Bureau of investigation and what they did\nIs they took the forensic evidence from the unexploded bombs and went through it meticulously and forensic ally to be able to come up with in a evidence which led back to ... or say Iraq as well as fingerprint on one or two of the bombs\nNow that's not always going to be possible but even when a bomb has been set up and has exploded frequently you can still get data from it ...\nYou not only do get data but you can also recreate the bomb so one of the things I mean we can we can take it from the Ramsey Yusef a World Trade center bombing in Nineteen Ninety three where they exploded a car and the\nNYPD and the FBI were able to recreate that car to the point where they came up with the Vin number from the car and the type of explosives and put it together to be able to track it back to Ramzi Yousef to be able to arrest him and satisfactorily convict him where he's still serving time in federal prison\nNow let me ask you this introduced you know the physical evidence like fingerprints DNA would save our say acts a name naturally have been to some extent on the list anyway because he had prior terrorism on his record he had ties to both Florida and New York\nAnd would you work at this as simultaneously by saying who are the best suspects that we already know may be in the mix\nWell we don't know if they came to that of eventually they probably would have being that he was in that area the fact that as you\nProperly allude to he had the ... prior threat of a bombings and the fact that uh he was driving round the van that would have probably eventually led to someone making a call if they didn't already\nAt what point do you ... I don't view it'd be a monumental task I Would imagine but at what point do we need to start screening male or at least packages the same way that people get screened before they go on an airplane where where's that are ridiculous suggestion or physically impossible\nWell I don't know about the physical impossibility of doing it I think it's something that's come out of this case and I'm surprised that they don't do it more often I Know FedEx and UPS\nDe do some kind of screening and to try and determine what they're shipping but the U.S postal service handling billions of pieces of mail a year\nIt may be much more of a difficult task but you would think that if you're going to implement that type of procedure you would start so with packages and work your way back to potentially envelopes and or anthrax\nDetectors ... and that's exactly what I'm thinking of and I know that I fly I don't know a dozen times a year most of it for work but I Know that when I'm walking through the line and my my years being scanned that they're looking at a screen and the just\nI fly I don't know a dozen times a year most of it for work but I Know that when I'm walking through the line and my my years being scanned that they're looking at a screen and the to some extent that thing is color coded it makes me think that\nMay be an automated system could at least spot some of the more obvious ones because\nI you know I Know that some of this is a closely held piece of information but I Know just by looking at the system\nThat things show up differently on that screen depending on what kind of material they're looking at are they looking at ... or they're looking at mental are they looking at the inside of a laptop and what does a legitimate laptop battery looked like and what his laptop battery looked like and what does a piece of plastic pipe look like if it's filled with some kind of powder\nI mean it could be ... or it could be full of explosives and I would imagine in this day and age uh we've got such good technological tools\nThat you'd think you might be able to scan many thousands of packages and just have the computer said to say when you see one that ... that fits a certain set of criteria\nKicked that one side and then we'll take a closer look at it and then you might be able to do these packages\nIt's an excellent point and I'm surprised we don't do it already what came out of this case is that we don't do it to that proportion look at an airport when you when I go through the screener and no matter what line Iran it goes there something suspicious shows up in that package which calls for secondary screening it kicks it\nOut of the machine kicks it out of the conveyor belt to a second conveyor belt I don't know why we couldn't look to do that in the U.S postal service\nAnd you wouldn't necessarily have to do with the human beings sitting there slowly examining each one if you know that a computer never gets tired you know if his scanning looking for particular characteristics it never gets tired and never has an off dead him never had the day when you didn't get your second cup of coffee and the computers should and now I'm not saying that machines are everything\nBut if you need to scan hundreds of thousands of baggage is I don't know how you could do it unless you had an army of people saying they're looking at screens all day\nOr you wouldn't do it we don't do it at the airport we do is we have a screener\nWho is alerted by at a computer screen that there's something that calls for secondary screening at with this package\nAnd that's what kicks it out so if you're a package was delayed by my package was delayed by a day or so I wouldn't mind if it needed a secondary screening and therefore was put into separate line\nAnd had to then be done by a human or even the second machine to us to a third\nPoint where a human then looks at it because I think that the safety of our postal employees and the people who are delivering the mail and people where it's going into a male role in certain buildings around this country you know the safety of our people\nIn our citizens are paramount to law enforcement as well as everyone else in this country\nNicely said now tell me this what else have we missed and what else have we learned about this one that we ought to be doing differently if anything\nWell I I think what we learned is how well law enforcement can come upon someone who is looking to do us harm and\nHow quickly law enforcement agencies around this country this happen to be kudos to him why pay day the FBI and the joy terrorists task force and the postal inspectors but you know it it shows what law enforcement around this country\nAnd what cops do every single day and every single jurisdiction to keep our people safe and how quickly they'll find you if you plan to do an act\nOf terrorism in this country and threatened the people of any city or any jurisdiction the police will get you they will rest you a will spend the rest of your life in jail say Iraq is now looking at fifty eight years with just the ...\nDo they will rest you will spend the rest of your life in jail say is now looking at fifty eight years with just the five charges they've charged with today I think they'll add additional charges other things are failed\nIt will be a life sentence in a way even fifty eight years it's fifty six years is a life sentence for him and he deserves every single day of it if not the death penalty\nI absolutely agree one last thing in about forty seconds and that is do you believe based on what we know and I know you're not you know in the position that crime lab is do you think he intended for any of these to go up or merely to have devices that we're real old enough to really terrorize people\nMost of the Tea Party a protest ones that I went to and ones that I saw in other cities and in D.C on television they were incredibly civilized event whereas you you look at the average left wing event a good example of January of twenty Seventy\nThey were incredibly civilized event whereas you you look at the average left wing event a good example in January of twenty Seventeen after Donald Trump's inauguration the crazy women's march ... you know the fact is\nThere's nothing wrong with women saying we want to be treated equally and equitably okay it's already in the law ... would you like and we'd like to burn some limousines we'd like to stage a protest in which people have their safety threatened and that causes a lot of trouble and gets us on TV I think that's what's crazy\n[noise] although I mentioned the Madonna telling telling us fill us support Trump and that's not black oh\nIs often fantasize dreamed of blowing up the White House that's when Madonna said and that is wacko as well and yet you know\nThat if a Republican had said this very same words in the very same tone of voice CNN would be running it in a video loop but if Madonna says it they say look what a strong powerful feminist she there's adult there is a really strong double standard\nAnd done I I Love journalism I'd been in it a long time and I love the craft I was in it as a reporter without my opinion uh being being shown in my stories and as a talk show host I give my opinions every day\nI Am proud of journalism but I'm not proud of what journalism has become because we have people who are supposed to be reporters and keep their opinions out who are inserting their opinions I worked my tail off\nAnd the proof that I think I kept my opinions out of my stories\nIs that when I went from being a reporter on both television or radio to being a talk show host there were folks I'd run into both strangers in people I knew who say\nYou're a conservative and I said yeah I'm a conservative ... well I never knew that and I said what did you think I was a wife you worked on television I thought you were a liberal I said well clearly I kept my opinion out of my reporting which is what reporters are supposed to do the other thing that's dangerous to the entire profession\nIs if you tell people when we cover stories were going to cover them in a double standard\nAt ... in other words if one group of people says something or does something we're going to tell this kind of story but if somebody else from the other side does precisely the same thing or something so similar there is nearly identical we're going to treat the story entirely differently\nI mean constantly I look up at these two screens in my studio one on Fox on it one was CNN on a big big screen TVs\nAnd I and I look at them and I see them saying with no proof Donald Trump says X or y or Z\nAnd I thought during the entire eight years of Obama I never once saw them say with no proof whatsoever Brock Obama today claimed to blah blah blah and I thought the but there ... there were plenty of times I mean when when when one bronco Obama was asked Juno that the IRS\nHas been going out and denying a conservative groups free speech rights by denying their application for tax free status all he had no clue and he said oh the first I knew about it was when I saw it on the news and I thought\nThat at a bold faced lie you can't make us you can't tell us on one hand you're a Harvard educated lawyer and your ... according to your fans one of the smartest guys on the planet and then turn around and say no I was completely clueless\nAs ... and I made the point of the time the president of the United states should be arguably one of the best in foreign people on the planet he has platoon of people around him from all these different agencies whose entire job is to gather every important piece of data in the world even stuff that that secret\nAnd then to boil it down to just what\nIs together every important piece of data in the world even stuff that the secret\nAnd then to boil it down to just what the president needs to know and say Mr President we are going to tell you what's going on in Turkey or what's going on in Iran we're going to tell you what's going on in Iowa and they boil it all down and they feed it to him and say this is what you need to know how\nCould a guy who's so well informed claim to be so ignorant of what was going on and the only answer is\nHe was lying and yet I never saw CNN or MSNBC or any of the rest of those ... or the New York times say\nThe president claimed without any sense of credibility\nThat he had no idea what was going on in the ... J during fast and furious or the IRS during a the the cheating on conservative groups he had no idea that the EPA without taking actions that would lead to the release of toxic contaminants into the Animas River he had an in other words\nAccording to Morocco Obama bronco bomber was arguably the single most clueless president in American history if you believed his denial of that\nThat's what's going on in any case at least the man is in custody he has been charged with crimes\nThat give convicted will put him away Caesar's say they'll put them away for the rest of his natural life\nAnd

store better if they keep better they're safer because inevitably glass bottles which\nWould be dropped a and the ... glass on the floor and you would you would never get\nPollution quote unquote and um we continue to have a a tax on various plastic ... things that make plastics pliable and and more convenient like this ... BPA\nUm and the attacks just go on and on and on a a base with without much basis um and without thinking about it carefully and considering the science\nWell and I thought about that too because I Know a lot of people say well you know there's food safety but I buy my food in tin cans what a lot of people may not appreciate is those so called tin cans with ... which have very little pin in them are actually lined with as you said BPA and other kinds of things that make\nA tin can a whole lot more save for containing any kind of food you buy the grocery store and and and I and the plastics\nYou know doc I think about the plastics where products you know including a lot of food products are package sometimes dramatically sealed and you know the air taken out or some other kind of gas put in so that so that everything last\nLonger and or is or is better better protected against the kind of common contamination they could literally take your live a few decades ago\nYou're you're absolutely right and you you bring up\nA broader point which is that you have to you have to do with their risk analysis folks called comparative risk assessment you have to ask if you if you eliminate a product day what are you a substitute for what are you left with\nA and so we're seeing that in California because there's a a a state senator who keeps introducing bills to ban Styrofoam containers from restaurants for takeout and for a for hot beverages or cold averages and uh\nIt seems popular because we see a Styrofoam trash around but the alternative of course is paper a which is more a consumptive of oil and electricity interestingly um\nBy the way I Want people to take note of that and the fact that they say well there's a ... I remember the McDonald's Styrofoam clam shells they'd put hamburgers and because it both insulated and kept the juice worried belong and they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't degrading the landfill and when I went on research in a long time ago\nI had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coded paper oh how does that'd be great and they said well it doesn't quite last as long in the landfill it it may be the Styrofoam would degrade over a you know hundreds of years and the paper will degrade over fewer hundreds of years am I right about those numbers are you are my aunt or\nDo you are absolutely right that the the other thing is that a police Styron\nA generates less waste water and also occupies less space in the landfill and the other thing is that we have we now have\nBacteria that will degrade\nA Styrofoam and and other plastics in the landfill so you know that this that these objections these attempts to ban things or just not well founded and well thought out so which is typical of what we see about the anti corporate anti technology but equal fundamentalist\nHey I Want to ask you about something else because about about an hour ago I was talking to a guest a who's a former police detective we're talking about the bomber you know the bombs that went through the males and he said well what he ... he thought it was interesting that we found out he's a he was a ... a retired top investigator for New York city's police department\nAnd he said we found out the postal service has things like this going through it and we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about\nAnd he said we found out the postal service has things like this going through it and we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about other kinds of contraband whether it's illegal drugs from Asia or we're seeing a stuff come through that it's\nIt's a marijuana gets shipped that way and if states haven't decided to legalize it it shouldn't be ship and I asked him\nWe had this technology we see at the airport and I you know while I don't know all the particulars of it I Know that when they watch your bag with computers and cell phones and this and batteries and all that go through\nThey know what color the screen is supposed to be and they know what colors indicate it may be some kind of contraband whether it's a fluid liquid or possibly explosive\nYou know I don't know what color explosive comes up as because I Would imagine I haven't been through the TSA line when somebody whose putting explosives through but my understanding is the color coding helps them spot those things pull him aside and do some more examination and I said\nIf you wanted to scan hundreds of thousands of uh packages the postal service carries\nCould we do that and could we say to a computer\nWhen a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray\nYou know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that they may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside and and let somebody else take a closer look at it\nThat's all the technology that did within our grasp isn't it\nIt it it is and with artificial intelligence or the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... in red flag and pass all uh in fact it's my understanding that checked\nBaggage is a analyze that way as well as the the the baggage that you put put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strangers doing the job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that this stuff that's going through the post office gets scanned by that same kind of thing I think the public would be all for it\nYeah I think we could certainly do that for packages a you know flat flat letters a could probably sail through and then maybe do it just for packages that's a very good idea laws\nWell I just it just struck me that if that's within our grasp but I'm the same guy who wants to see a chicken irradiated before I did get sent to the supermarket suing kill all the salmonella or the other bacteria\nOr the ... that's on the exterior of it is it isn't a cure all but it was ... a lot of the contamination and probably for lettuce and salads because it seems like every other week I'm hearing about some other kinds of solid product that's making people sick and I keep thinking it radiation good solve that but\nHere Joe I thought you were keeping most of the nuts in Virginia and the purple part of the state around Richmond is don't you try and keep them confined up there\nAnd try to at least get them elected to office and then they can do crazy things like you know go ...\nOn a board member from a jails to try to get you know our catch and release program to complete it at our local jail but you know aside from those nuts um yeah we we are short a few nuts in this town\nAnd I and cross for ... Virginia and the mid Atlantic is is seeing this for quite a bit of what they are in the are coming to the side of the road\nSo maybe more hunting ... yeah I mean you get ... I went archery hunting for the first time this year I've been ... modern rifle before that\nAnd I wouldn't want to shoot a rifle in places is crowded with humanity is the commonwealth is but I wouldn't mind going back and trying to put an arrow in a beer or two but it is you say that's been restricted as well\nYeah and and with the national park a running along skyline drive a there's so much protected area\nWhere it's very restricted um the ... you know be survival is they know where it's safe they know where the family is you know this family grows larger and larger and larger uh it uh\nIt's just going to keep you know re multiplying itself uh so I think you know good management of her you're a hunter you understand that probably the best you know natural is our hunters because they don't want to over ... because then they have no\nReal meat for next year if they hunt the herd down to nothing and uh and and that's where it is is of course it feeds\nThe or the left wing green ease the this idea that we're over growing despite the fact that we have in eighty five percent of our arable land is in protection in one way shape or form and our property the costs are going through the roof so we can't even afford to live around here so I don't know how the\nIs in protection in one way shape or form in our property costs are going through the roof so we can't even afford to live around here so I don't know how they can say we're over developed but\nI mean I I just wonder uh gosh how do you solve this have you again on a more a governor Northam that's your your democratic\nAh he ... he probably believes a welfare programs all the ... seemed to do that as he thought about bringing in large trucks full of nuts I mean not for a antifa rally but a large truck full of nuts to maybe feed the bears so so they're not wandering around on the highways\nTrue story he just delivered six million taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood and\nSeveral hospitals for\nBirth control amongst poor women a Sunday remarkable you liked the case that broad Kerry bus before the Supreme Court ah for you know a albeit now technologically possible to have temporary sterilization\nOr that might be something that could do I don't know what the clinics are for the bears but I'm sure that would probably be the humanitarian way is to\nProvide you know perhaps abortions too the bears if they're overpopulating\nI gotta tell using is crazy in the commonwealth come out west out here you've got environmental groups who want to do to to bowl like Asian on here\nBecause they can't get that does to reliably take their pill every morning on the ... so I'm not kidding they wanted they they want to ... the ... the does the females and and then ... on them\nSo they get like gosh yeah so they can go and get busy and and the problem is is I understand is that they do they actually have a bad effect on this because there is a natural process investors that if you let it happen if you don't\nThen I guess it can actually make the does appear to be available all and I'm not kidding about this I don't know they actually make the does appear available all year round instead of just during ones one specific season of let's get busy and and then that\nBrings in all the all the males and they've they've had that problem and I think in New York state in a couple of places that\nYou know I'm Sorry to hear that you have more of a nut problem because I I thought all that in flux from Richmond was causing enough I've been a problem to lose too\nAnd it's only a week and a half toll action day so\nHow's it going to come out I mean what what's the big one going on in the commonwealth right now\nOn the outs Dave Dave brat versus out at the Yale spanberger well he ...

time my question is the\nBiggest question that a lot of people ask is where does this evidence live from two thousand two for this gentleman\nA vet not even a gentleman but a person that created bombs and all of a sudden we have evidence from two thousand two why was this guy not on a watch list and then from that watch lists why it was not created\nHere that have a good long ...\nWay to why was this guy not on a watch list and then from that watch lists why wasn't not created he had a good\nLong ... ... a criminal record over all those years and ah and if you take a look and you're going to hear more but I think overnight\nBut he has a long list of things where he has either been arrested\nOr or convicted of various crimes and and that's where all that evidence comes from so that's the simple in short answer thank you for your pick for the call and\nThanks for listening in Texas you know I got to tell you your data is out there everywhere there are data breaches Facebook breaches

incredibly well\nAt that time [noise] Swedish quality\nA lower tax is now the European countries and that made us incredibly well\nAt that time a Swedish politicians thought that we can do anything\nWell let's just sort of do things that feel nice and distribute money\nOr to our favorite coal suits and I'm just create a generous welfare state and that's what they did in the night and send them to the night and maybe the size\nOf the government double a tax increase the government is government regulate the economy and the labor markets\nAre but the result wasn't this sort of half the night these in society and that they that they intended it was more like in an\nEye on rent novel because our big companies are great entrepreneurs us I'm even are sort of direct dislike\nHim a bird and sports stars like the one board\nThey left sweet they stopped being productive in Sweden because the economy was suffocated was drowning in taxes and regulation or for that he is the seat of the economy they didn't create a single next job in the private sector\nA whole new jobs were created in the public sector and\nIn the end that made it impossible to fund the government of that size so it was a a long period of just generally are\nLagging behind other countries having lower growth rates than the others are but it also and in a terrible financial crisis in the early Nineteen nineties when\nOther ... countries didn't want to lend us money because it didn't seem like we were gonna survive for for a long time so for for a brief period of time the central bank country implement a\nAn interest rate at five hundred percent to defend the Swedish currency and the time even the social as soon as we said no it's not we can't do this we have to dismantle this experiment

for America\nAnd you demonstrate how Sweden managed to pull itself back from the brink from five hundred percent interest rates and become the fourth most prosperous nation in the world was it easy to persuade people to leave behind those previous policies and go for something that was more free markets and lower taxes\nWell it wasn't and um\nYou know people don't want to give up things are but they get for free or so that took many years of 'em on discussion but what really changed the whole thing was\nWas this crisis that the physical moment and uh you know it's like that old saying that the prospect of being hang in the morning\nFocuses alliance you have to focus and concentrate on what's really important and for example our Social Security system and people wanted very generous pensions they had been prominence very generous pensions by our politicians but at this time when\nThe economy tanked\nAnd it seems like everything was going to collapse people realize that the alternative to reform wants the generous pensions the alternative to reform was a collapse of the whole social\nThe old telling it to to retool lawsuit generous pension built into it truthful will collapse of the whole Social Security system\nAnd in that case a ... it's a more secure\nAnd shows or better so the Social Democrats out of the central like I read that you're going to ... system and hatred use individual else as well um and they did and and it would create it\nNot because they wanted it because he'll turn it off and that was the case and in many areas as well eat realizing the

happens is that you've got a property let's rent it out and you know you do have expenses and whatnot but if you buy properly or your comics feature expenses but because of the tax code pre shake the

R. E. S.\nBasically means that you take an education and the training to work with seniors at different ages and nobody wants to be called older except for like the four year old wishes he was\nFive years but the designation kind of runs from baby boomers\nI needed a little bit earlier people who were just thinking about\nThings like downsizing all the way up to folks who are almost a hundred years old there's a lot lower planning family conference saying things like that that go on them or the typical sale and there's a big need because sometimes people are taking advantage of\nI see now according to its very definition the seniors real estate specialist designation is meant to help people fifty years old and older with all their real estate\nVery definition the seniors real estate specialists designation is meant to help people fifty years old and older\nWith all their real estate needs as you said so one of those needs may well be investing in real estate in your later years so tell me is that a smart idea or is that something you're better off starting\nIn your twenties thirties and forties\nMy opinion is is better off starting it early\nBecause that's been real estate basically asked for different areas of possible gain\nThe first is appreciation of property obviously rises in price over time as area around it does as well second profit center is that the tenant increases your equity by essentially helping you pay your mortgage down three is cash flow\nRent better bigger than outlook and depreciation so in order to put all for those two words you really want to get started early\nMhm to be a first time in ... in real estate as you get older I Would say hesitate or perhaps a look at things like reach real estate investor crust that you can basically purchase through an investment advisor more like a a security than a real estate purchased itself\nYou know that makes a lot of sense because after all a real estate investment trust is more like buying stock and you're not a landlord and you don't have vacancies you don't have to qualify for a mortgage it can make a lot of sense no matter what your age is\nAbsolutely it's kind of one of those things that if you believe that real estate both appreciation generates cash flow which\nIt has historically done that's a great way not to be the only one on the hook you know being an individual owner of real estate is is kind of a you know you're the person in a ... year spread out with hundreds of other people buying\nLarger blocks with investment property and professional property management\nI see so that's good advice be or if you are already an older person it might not be the best move to start real estate investing at your age but for all those people who might be a little bit younger than that it can reap great benefits in the years ahead\nAbsolutely interesting fact the last forty years appreciation and we used to do it every January as average about three percent per year coincidentally or maybe not the wage growth in our area\nThree percent a year ... so if you believe that our economy is strong enough to keep wage growth and employment on track [noise] there's no reason that real estate pricing at least closer in shouldn't keep pace with wage increases\nPeter we still have so much more to talk about and I'd like to really drill in on your four ways real estate can generate

build wealth and generate income and your senior years\nRight now we're going to continue our conversation with an expert a person who actually teaches real estate investing to people all around the United states [noise] joining us again now is Peter ... real tour with\nBishop west real estate license to Massachusetts Vermont New York and Florida he's been a real tour for Thirty years and\nHe carries many of NPR's advanced certifications including the certified commercial investment member designation Peter thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's my pleasure to be back thank you for having me\nWell Peter I appreciate you coming back when we left you in our first our we had just finished talking about a tried and true real estate investment strategy in which you buy another house but you keep the one you're in and rent it out that seems like a great way to start\nEspecially if it is a rental market for example where we are in Florida right now there's a terrific went to a lot of ... ... ... air being the murder in so long yeah top dollar\nBy renting out of the Arab be India's a weekly or monthly right do an essay and you'll rent to ... but an annual rental is slow and steady slow and steady when\nThe race [laughter] that's always going to either So Peter if someone's leaning forward and listening to this and they're fascinated by it how would you advise that they find a good property that will continue to generate a good amount of rent\nThe first thing that you need is a good realtor that knows the market and not somebody that you know from the gym or the country club that's nice to be\nA realtor that specializes in investment property and understand somebody that's willing to sit down and oh of course let's blame the pros and cons some states that if you're a residential rental property than others\nIt gets a critical piece of advice as we knew the into real estate for investment\nLeathers residential vacation rental\nOffice retail industrial you got to know what you're doing what I mean by that is you need to know the landlord tenant laws in that state\nAs how it pertains you understand that part of the business of rentals you will be on top of your game are reached Seventy five percent on your way south the successes understanding the rules\nThat is such great advice and you know we already mentioned buying a new house and keeping the one you already have but if you want to stay in your house and you're not going to move how would you recommend one of our listeners pays for property they fine\nWell you know you if you have equity in your current how it could refinance your home and take equity or you get a bridge loan between the two properties ... there are a lot of private investors out\nIt was that what they call hard money\nYeah absolutely could be called hard money\nPrivate equity investors but what a lot of folks can do you can't buy it yourself\nBut you can invest is if you have a\nIRA you can take it to be a self directed IRA\nSome banks to what some national come next to it and you invest the money you direct where it goes so for example somebody looking for money for a down payment on a deal or to finance a flip property or to get into something needs\nFifty Seventy five a hundred thousand a good source of self directed IRAs because that person's gonna get more in a real estate investment based on interest in return than they would\nIf they were to um just have it with a institutional IRA company that's paying\nProbably two percent today stock markets good maybe it's three percent\nYou know Peter that is fascinating now let me ask you another question about all this you know you have\nMore than one hundred properties if you combine Florida in Massachusetts [noise] did you just kind of end up there or was that part of your plan to have one hundred one properties by this time in your life\nThat was kind of planned out the Massachusetts is where I'm my home and I raised my son as it turned out that yes it was in the play in Venice, Florida is the right\nSpot has a lot of desire ability and therefore it gives me a face on the Gulf Coast where I can go up and down and do what I Need to do so that was definitely in the plan\nThat is wonderful one more question for you my friend tell our listeners if you will\nThat if they retire and they have anywhere from a handful\nOf properties to a whole lot of properties what will their life be like\nI wouldn't know what we're from it is and that's and that's a nervous word for bay but I can assure you that\nYou'll be able to live the lifestyle that you're looking to live without worrying about it because you're controlling your own destiny\nPeter that is just such great perspective and thank you for all the insides and

players and the smart home arena Amazon Echo Google Home an apple home pod they all started his just smart speakers really smart speakers which you could ask anything and the speaker would answer by talking to you\nKnow that was the status quo until Amazon added video screens their big echo show and they're cute little echo spot were game changers because with their bright colorful screens you could watch the news watch the forecast and watch the steps in a recipe\nAnd for more than a year Amazon owned that space until last July when Lenovo launched a smart display with built in Google Assistant\nIt was followed closely by another Google display from J. B. L. but just this month Google announced their own version in their biggest development yet\nThe Google hub the replacement for its original Google Home the hub has a seven inch video screen and premium speakers built in\nAnd when it comes everything Google is known for from Youtube videos to step by step map directions to your personal calendar but now you can see all those things not just hear about them\nNow the Google hub is a smaller device which would fit justice comfortably on a night stand is in the kitchen and perhaps because it would make such a good smart alarm clock nestled right next to your bed the Google hub does not come with a camera\nNow the pet store shelves this Monday October twenty second and its entering the market at a lower price point one hundred fifty dollars compared to two hundred and thirty dollars for the second generation Amazon show\n... how about apple\nWell so far it's excellent smart speaker the home pod well that's all they have there's no talk of an apple smart display not even a rumor so what if you already have a smart speaker without a display\nGone to the point where it's you know ... well over a quarter million dollars worth of equity that they had in the house because things would appreciate it when it's a principal residents of subject to certain rules\nThey can sell that house and put that quarter of a million dollars in their pocket free of tax\nAnd if they're married it's five hundred\nExactly [noise] so what I'm saying ... some people doing as well is\nTaking that exclusion by another property and start that exclusion all over again\nStart the clock up again in ... slash five hundred\nAnd that's particularly useful for people who are thinking gallon size so why can't sell the big home walk anywhere from fifty five hundred thousand start the clock over again in the tunnels intend to Fifteen Years cell that walking your capital gains free forever by a condo\nThat is such a great strategy Peter\nSo for example I'm In my early sixties and I sold my single family last year and in addition to locking in that equity I no longer own a lawnmower\n[laughter] I can go fishing whatever I Want [laughter]\n[noise] oh my gosh you know it just comes to mind that real estate can help you in so many ways in her later years you don't have to limit yourself to being an investor you can be just smart with your primary residence\nCorrect exactly Peter awesome advice great job and I really appreciate you sharing your knowledge with all our listeners today thank you thank you very much I enjoyed it quite a bit\nYou're very welcome Peter Crouch real tour and associate broker with macaroni associates incorporated in Alexandria, Virginia [noise]\nA real chore who give back\nThis is rewarding helping veterans and see in the community rise up to assist veterans\nTwo veteran fish is rewarding helping veterans and see in the community rise up to assist veterans is like west very rewarding that's next right here on real estate today [noise]\nYou want a beautiful wood floor and your kitchen about or material but you also know eventually there will be water or mugged there which ruined everything right or\nWrong would would look like Bruce vinyl plane flooring only available at the Home Depot and you get the would look you want a plug in completely one hundred percent waterproof guarantee so now where there's water there can be ...\nLife ... final Frank Lawrence starting to to Seventy nine ... only ... at the Home Depot or say\nUs when we start bringing down\nAn official message for Medicare open enrollment ends soon so now's the time to be open minded look at everything like prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans I'm having insurers why\nBecause climb straight so can you how I found lower cost and extra benefits and saved money open to something better\nBut it's better just got a call one eight hundred Medicare today open enrollment ends December seventh\n[noise] paid for by the U.S department of health and Human Services\n[noise]\nHere's the cold hard truth about hard water in our home nearly Ninety percent of America is affected by a hard water contains harsh mineral that can dry out skin and hair hard water can raise our electricity bill by up to\nForty eight percent it even create filled out the pipes that can lead to pathogenic bacteria growing stressed out yet he'll be felt based ... can solve all your hard water as you\nGet the full scoop at a little salt dot org [noise]\nBy the time that we got up there he's ... now they went and had blown and drifted than you know up again by my house blocking lanes on from my furnishings okay I heard the smoke alarm going off\nIn my friend's apartment without the ... and then when I mean here you had it not man for an acting and army went on line and they would come to Nicole and not have their teacher and I grabbed my ...

enrolling in financial base university I feel like I made one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return lease car\nTo the dealership or at this point I just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nMe take your car back that you own money on our signed a lease on that's effectively\nA voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb\nBecause they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it\nAnd the other and on repossession lot\nAnd then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the difference goes you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car fleece company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're the least is a very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off I'm Alone when it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nSo the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that well that's what strikes by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that\nTo KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sales what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up and the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole ... probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank\nAnd you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will sell it for on the report lot so his bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the difference is greater\nAnd you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession\nAnd so you cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather you'll be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nSo um they ribs utility to borrow money no diver and she's telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that and so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we've been talking a lot about this

eight large that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com and we have of course the last couple of days been talking about the brutal murder of Saudi born legal permanent resident of this country ... ...\nAnd I wanted to talk to a Frank gap thing about that he's the founder and president of the center for security policy\nDid you know ... a Frank at all\nI did not lost on no nothing bit but I'm not a person like limited let them do\nWhat do you think we're being told that he was in that embassy in Turkey for uh some interrogation ie apparently walked in to try to get a birth certificate of some kind that was going to allow him are no divorce or typical that would allow him to get married to his fiance and he goes in his fiance standing outside\nHe simply does not come back out at the time the embassy a closed up and he was apparently a interrogated and they say an interrogation gone wrong what little we been able to find out about what happened is it pretty clear here that the Saudi Government or people who acted on behalf of the Saudi Government murdered this man\n[noise] it seems as though that's the case of course in the in the consulate that would've been people who were supposed to be there um\nPresumably representatives of the Saudi Government there were some Fifteen of men are better than the special forces background who or flown in I think\nEarlier that day or the day before and left immediately after this incident so there there's a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests that the government of Saudi Arabia was involved I I kinda think of this from what we know so far Lars this kind of a\nA mafia war\nBecause no one had you had the\nSaudi Government a predominantly\nNow guided by the crown prince Mohammed bin ... and the U.S a man who is clearly a consolidating power and trying to take his country and about different ways uh uh in a new direction yup\nAnd on the other hand you had a guy who was very\nClosely associated with and seems to have worked for the former head of Saudi intelligence turkey I'll flies all\nOf a man with the Muslim Brotherhood background a who has worked in the media relations a space for a turkey ... and the intelligence services for Saudi Arabia under the previous government or the one that\nDoesn't sell them on his father a decentralized replaced and what we know about that or is it was evidently\nThe fed by the way up there is law you're insulting the keepers of the holy places uh the the family of Saudi Arabia royal family but\nHe was also threatening it seems uh the the uh the government of a now predominantly M. B. S. as they call it so it it was a it was a\n... ... what it was designed to such or whether it just went bad wait until now at the moment but I think it was kind of like a you know one ... or ... took out the other and a and did it in a ruthless Sasha\nMy because Frank I think the American people and I I think you know there's been a night or being sold a bill of goods we're being told well does innocent journalist who's just writing things that are critical of the government which journalist in this country do all the time whether it's Obama\nOr Trump they they write critical things about the government I say critical things about the government but this guy was a player in the Muslim Brotherhood\nHe was a friend of Osama bin Laden\nAnd you said that he shared that organizations goal of trying to supplant the current government which is you say the current government of Saudi Arabia is trying to take\nThat country in a western direction\nAnd uh and and this guy was trying to stop that so\nYou know wild that while that may not justify his murder um\nI I could certainly see that the American public's being told was just a journalist who was murdered and that's wrong they're not being told he was a political player who may have been trying to is it fair to say overthrow the current Saudi Government and take it back and in Islam is direction\n[noise] well it certainly reason to believe that that's the aspirations of the Muslim Brotherhood you know they they didn't to\nOverthrow of the government of a President Mubarak in Egypt the they were able to achieve that through a democratic process but they certainly were I'm\nTaking Egypt in ... premises direction now the government of Saudi Arabia Sharif premises too but it's it's a it's a\nGroup under the Brotherhood that would be very hostile to us as was the Morsi regime in a post Mubarak Egypt and I think what the president and the government is is trying to wrestle with is first of all we don't know as much as we'd like and second of all we don't want to\nBring or otherwise contribute to the removal of the relatively friendly not altogether but relatively friendly government under bother to solve on\nWas one that would be dead set against us and our vital interest in a strategic place like Saudi Arabia the Iranians would like that um other enemies of this country would applaud but I think that's not in our interest in the president's walking a fine line I think\nYeah and it's a tough one let's talk about something else the statutory commission to assess the threat to the United states from electromagnetic pulse big name we've talked about EMP before on this program it could come from an an attack\nFrom any number of sources it could come from a natural solar flare but it would literally knock out some or all of every single computer chip in America which runs everything\nRefrigeration water power sewer you know the whole thing and in many many people would die if that happened in even up an area of this country\nThe Congress has finally hearing some specific things that can be done to safeguard against this threat\nWell they've been hearing it for years a large the first of these commissions are reported in two thousand four and a has done so several times since I'm a whole bunch of reports were finished about to hear it\nThose things and so we may not actually get the kind of\nA clarity about the danger that will say single let alone the\nCorrective action that's needed um at least if this uh this new commission that's coming on stream a presumably shortly is a is involved and and this is heartbreaking because I think the president wants to do something about this I Believe John Bolton as bus or a national\nSecurity advisor is very ... committed to trying to\nShake sisters that executive order that sort of a kicking around inside the uh the executive branch at the moment to\nProtect our grid it's absolutely vital and you say a lot of the 'cause my died by some estimates according to the previous commission that might be Ninety percent of us yeah\nEven hit ... yeah I mean if we had a ... kind of attacks and you know North Korea that maybe a smaller a threat at this point but if anybody a terrorist group hit the west coast within EMP and knocked\nOut all water all power all sewer all all all supply\nAll ability to move goods around or anything like that we could we could end up with a lot of communication that all of that even if the rest of the country we're capable of throwing in to help we see how even small disasters\nOr will will tax the

now but I'm not a difficult for us and I actually I\nI I can tell that just by talking to you and I have to tell you of all the Web sites that I see and I do a lot of research and I I Try not to confine myself to just a narrow range\nYours is perhaps the most optimistic but not optimistic you know based on just ... to look at the world but optimism based on real numbers and I'm I I follow your Twitter feed and I think it's absolutely amazing what you've been able to do so\nGive my audience a taste of what happens when you actually look at the real numbers not just about the United states but about the rest of the world and how things are are getting and had been getting a lot better for a long time and they're on an upward trend\nWell thanks for the opportunity to do to your uh took to audience ah basically\nUm ... it's much easier to put together a list of things where the world is getting was than a list of things where the world is getting better because the world is improving along many different dimensions ah most importantly obviously people live much longer than they used to um get a life expectancy\nFor hundreds of thousands of years Bailey was about twenty five to seven years ah now\nIt's ah I'm Seventy nine years in a in other countries it's Seventy\nTwo years in developing world um we have more food than ever before ah for most of human history people worried about getting enough calories to see the next day [noise] um today people worry about obesity\nUm literacy ah it it's almost a universal um girls go to school was previously a they weren't allowed to\nUm there's even more peace around the world very few people appreciate that are really for the first time in recorded history there are no international conflict by which I mean conflict between two silver and nations so that there are a lot of ways in which I'm In which the world is getting better unfortunately\nUh the media but also the human brain and we can talk about the structure of the human brain late to a focus is on the negative rather than the positive and so instead of long term trends people are looking at um\nYou know individual instances of where a something bad happens and they assume that that somehow represent states abroad trends but ...\nMean Mario on I I have to plead guilty that I've worked in the news business for a long time and I I hated it they'd be would say why is that you always tell bad news and I said well\nUh we have I happen to live in a city with a few hundred thousand homes and I said we always do the story about the one home that caught fire last night instead of the two hundred and Ninety nine thousand homes that didn't catch fire and that can lead you to a little bit of a pessimistic attitude but\nI'll tell you the number that impressed me the most because we realize that well money isn't everything\nThe ability to be out of the extreme poverty which has been you know it's been the norm as you say for an awful lot of the world for a long time\nBut you took numbers from the world bank and pointed out the people who live in extreme poverty in Nineteen Ninety that was thirty six percent of the world more than a third of the world lived in extreme poverty and lived on less than two dollars US dollars per day and that's adjusted for local prices\nThat number between Nineteen Ninety and today twenty five years dropped from a third of the world\nTo about one tenth of the world now we'd like to get it to zero zero but you said even though world population increase by two billion people the number of those\nScratching a living out of the dirt was was reduced by one point two billion and I just wish more of those numbers were put in income to put it in context the other developments where we do have to say there's a famine here or a drought there\n[noise] yeah I'm as max Rosa from ... pointed out\nUm we could have a ... or the number ... ... the newspaper's could run the following headline every day one hundred and Seventy seven thousand people have escaped from a salute poverty today and they could ever on aid for the last twenty five\nYears and he would be true um but to your point about the news cycle that the problem is that good things tend to happen on a different time scales from bad things bad things tend to happen immediately and that's\nThe way they use is what is good things are incremental they improved slowly over long periods of time and uh consequently\nUm they don't like the the headlines are the headlines usually are if it bleeds it leads\nNonetheless we live in a world with the least amount of absolute ... ever and for the first time of the Brookings Institution show last week or two weeks ago a loss that half of the world is middle class who would've thought\nHalf of the world out of what are we ready to seven billion or eight billion already\nWelder seven and a half billion people in the world and what the Brookings Institution there it is to divide the world into four groups are the first group is people who live in absolute publicity\nThat's below two dollars per person per day adjusted for our um local prices are then the second group was between two dollars and eleven dollars\nThen the third group which is\nWhere the middle class begins was uh from eleven to a hundred and ten dollars and finally the school walls over a hundred and ten\nDollars per person per day and a roughly three point six billion people a fall into that category between eleven dollars and I'm I'm a hundred and ... and the over a hundred and ten dollars so um yeah for the first time in in in world history half of the world is a middle class\nI'm Talking to Mario ... who's the editor of human progress dot org I highly recommend the side and their Twitter feed and I've got no other dog in the fight I just look I I was talking to a reporter today and she said uh your wife tells me that you're an optimist I said I Am an optimist I think most problems can be solved and things are getting better\nI'm I'm a big fan of ... who wrote this you know this guy or gal environmentalist but you don't just focus on the numbers and on on dollars and cents you also focus on just the general improvement of the human condition can you give my audience a an example or two of how things are getting better you mentioned education\nMhm [noise] well I'm a first of all let me just say quickly that I don't think that you and I are me to be optimistic this is not about convincing people to be\nOptimists certainly on blind up to us it's about people\nBeing ... about having a realistic view of the world and the realistic view of the world is while on the way things are improving\nNow when it comes to education a that's a that's a perfect example you know I'm a as late as uh the beginning of the of the of the twentieth century it was very rare for people to receive more than a\nTwo or three years of education even in the most are developed countries I'm now a education the primary education suddenly so at least seven or eight years of primary education is completely stand at the end\nOf one of the reasons for why that happened last technology ... ...\nI Do like doing little bark and one of the greatest inventions also caused the tractor a and a a mechanization of agriculture because for the first time in history I'm a farm owners didn't have to rely on that children\nAre in order to the farm work um but we're able to keep the children at work while uh the the the head of the family of the farmer\nUsed a tractor and in order to produce a to to to to produce his harvest and um and that was very important because as late as Nineteen hundred forty percent of Americans who are unemployed in another culture\nIn twelve Thirteen Years we're supposed to practically doubled fuel efficiency and what that does is as you said earlier\nThey have to a vastly increased costs in order to implement technology things like hybrid vehicles which are vastly more expensive than traditional vehicles or they have to wait wait and they're doing both\nAnd the problem is is that um there's very little benefit for this this at thousands of dollars up to six thousand seven thousand dollars per price of an average vehicle by most estimates and the this is right now because there's not an energy shortage a gas can be\nIt's not because it's because the demand not because of supply the oil of a crisis of the seventies is over America's an energy giant now we have more reserved than ever so the rationales entirely gone to only rationale is to fulfill pretty much of a green agenda of leftist politicians and bureaucrats\nAnd pushing people out of cars so Gerard ... is this going to happen could we see the Trump Administration say let's freeze the standards now when if you frozen standards\nWouldn't affect me if prices stopped going up on cars more people buying new cars more fuel efficient cars already because we know that a ten year old car is not going to get as good gas mileage\nAs the one that's brand spanking new or a year or two old if we could\nStop that and just say let's just freeze the standards or has come as close to a freezes possible on all the new standards were pushing the car companies to get there\nIf we could reduce the cost of to the American family uh buying an automobile more of them would buy brand new ones that means more van would have new were cars a year or two or three or five years old\nAnd we can reduce that Thirteen your average age back to something lower than that we'd get cleaner air we'd get more fuel efficiency\nAnd we wouldn't have to batter the consumer with these gigantic price increases\nAbsolutely not just the consumer but our auto makers their competitiveness our jobs are you know our economy it hits it hits all the way down and the ridiculous idea is that as you said earlier because you've got to\nGet that average you're going to sell cars the smaller cars which are not as profitable but you want a skill away from the\nUm cars that are the bigger cars that are more comfortable and have more features that people want they'll actually increase the price of those to push people into lower cars so it really skews the market at squares profitability\nOf it you know screws up all of the various ways that the economy should be running with consumer choice and auto makers\nMaking vehicles that people actually want to drive and were you living in a gray days right now or technology is doing amazing things with a you know crash warnings and laying changing and break assessed and all and all that good stuff that's making cars safer but with these crazy CAFE standards they are going to keep people out of these cars and\nThey're going to hold onto their car much longer um which is not only less fuel efficient but it's also less safe\nWell and it and that's a big difference because they say when you get to smaller cars for every hundred pounds you trim off the car you say well that's more efficient and say it's also five percent more likely to kill you in a crash\nAnd and frankly I Know that they knew they couldn't go out and say we're going to make it illegal for you to buy a pickup truck or an SUV unless you can prove your family needs that they couldn't get away with that what would they could do is say that new pickup truck or if she is going to cost you fifty sixty Seventy thousand dollars\nAnd they knew consumers would say all of that expensive all by the small car\nGerard keep up the good work at a consumer action for a stronger economy

Fifteen eight eight eight ten the right so it's kind of pages where they knew we could say we covered that story was on page eight ten right there\nIn front of God and everybody in and nobody actually saw it but the Beto O'Rourke stories sounds like a very interesting one we've talked about it in passing on this program but he\nLied about a DUI arrest\nAh when when he was younger and and the fact is he tried to run away from the scene and you would think that kind of scandal with dogs somebody and until and unless he actually makes a clean breast of it and says yeah it happened I did the wrong thing he can he can resolve this one pretty ... pretty quickly couldn't they\nJust say ... you say you know are they in a mistake when he was younger uh is that he chose to lie about about the ... say they and and\nUh when in fact that the liberal Washington Post who is actually fairly debate or they actually is a bad check a said that they do or the game for ... you know he knows that said that you know that he clearly lied about ...\nUh the arrest or this is this this is lie of the interest\nDidn't make any of the major three network evening all morning shows or even Sunday roundtable shows what's even worse is that a a CBS this morning toast you know what he got she interviewed better wrote on October fifth\nAh and never brought up the fact that he had a DUI arrest\nOr you'd think that that ... some hot material let's talk about Senator Claire McCaskill has been and what he did with this government program\nOkay so there's a I'll Try to simplify it is actually there is a tax credit\nProgram that's intended to help a a bill the house is a housing for the poor a and a ...\n... ... Joseph Saddam shepherd was clearly center of cutter McCaskill husband dead is he a bottom all these tax credits that again or post the to help build cheap housing for the poor and he flipped him do other developers and end up earning like you know millions of dollars\nA by doing that so he basically took of an joke of a program that was a candidate help the poor you know liberal Democrats both go by helping to porches I slip them said personally and ...\nAnd ... and in that case all he was was an intermediary you you know he he didn't actually do anything he just buys the tax credits up and then flip them to other developers he was a marketing guy and he pulled a profit off that\nExactly now it's crazy a finely teeth Alison I still don't understand why the major media is a dog in this one except for the fact that Keith ... Keith Ellison the person of color and he's a Muslim two strikes against it\nKind of like a Kermit guys now the abortion doctor if you've got a couple of those characteristics the media is happy\nTo stay miles away from your story\nWell you know and this is what's really upset about this is we're supposed to be in the whole hashtags me too movement right ever since it's been just a little over a year since the ... broke\nAnd and but when it comes to a Democrat like a you know ... ... email us and\nUh his ex girlfriend has all these just atrocious charges about physical abuse that he did to her a gene ... denies the story but look at the allegation ... I think it Bailey's deserves\nA especially in you know I you know and and look up the beach movement enemies are pushing that\nIt deserves ... so I first step in the long track party followed it for a while using his ex girlfriend so there was some coverage of this on the network but it just told three minutes and forty seven seconds\nWell if you want to keep track of these stories that are being ignored by the major media check them out at media Research Center Jeff thanks a lot we appreciate your help\nThank you so much\nThat is a pleasure to have you on let's go to your calls now Kevin's on the line Kevin welcome to Lars Larson show what's on your mind on this Tuesday night\nAnd thanks for taking my call um [noise] so I got three major differences a for Iraq\nObama's or a comic approach versus a Donald Trump or on a couple of laughs and rock Obama's or should be a crime um so you know their approach was quantitative easing his entire term which\nMoney and giving it to the largest banks which the banks turn around and bought a a U.S treasury she got three percent interest stock yup I'm no uh uh Elizabeth Warren and a\nBernie Sanders a ... you know they've switched their tune now but if you uh do the research on that and even in her own book she Elizabeth Warren's fought that the whole time calling out to a ... a Timothy Geithner a ... a ...\nOn that and uh\nThe uh um the other thing is is that uh uh they took a a twenty three billion dollars or more I guess it could be eighty eight if you really follow the math\nOn it diluted\nThe a U.S a shareholder or or worldwide shareholders in a General Motors and stepped in line and in a paid off the campaign deaths\nAnd uh uh they were sued by a a teachers' unions police unions a civil action suits\nA against that and uh um uh uh but nobody nobody uh uh squawks about that and ah they they executed\nOne of the worst crimes on the American taxpayer ever and and uh a liberal so come around and they all talked about a Reaganomics or or even a tax cut\nA but is there it on their example of a Reaganomics given to the rich and it trickles down her any bigger exam\nIs there any bigger example of of a given money to a printing money now borrowing and not moving from one place to the other but printing money and given it to banks and hoping they lend it which they could not\nI don't think there is a good example of that and that's the thing that's all he does what's it called Keynesian economics economics but the idea being\nThat if you prime the pump up the economy by injecting a bunch of free money that that will make the pump start turning and that when you do that or start producing a a result that when you do that to the economy\nThat it'll actually jak the economy up and then the economy will run on its own it's a lot like believing a perpetual motion machine and it doesn't make sense it doesn't work\nBut that's an issue that needs to be resolved by each country or if your government is persecuting you because you're gay or because you're a different religion or whatever I understand that but even then\nIf the standard was uh the economy stinks and there are a lot of ... there's a lot of criminal activity\nHow many of the seven billion people on planet earth might be able to credible you say you know those things are lousy back home I'd like to go somewhere else I Would imagine it'd be a very large number\n[noise] yeah and and that's the key point that ... that of course is\nMissing from the higher and higher or whatever we talk about the care of the press never seen that they can set of facts has an ... or ... million people I'm sure all of them I Love to come to the United states\nAnd we let them all at a ... we could I mean it would completely over on the United states if we allow that to happen so we have to put the laws in place that we have to like\n... or so so you know ... and you mentioned the seven billion people around the world about you know thirty to fifty percent of them were also love to cover the United states that that that that probably has always helped people back in their home countries try to help their economy improves try to help the government\nGet control of a criminal activity that happens when you take place there and that's what President Trump seems to be threatening right now I he he is apparently told the president of hot Dora hey what kind of all federal funding if you guys don't stop this caravan heading up to the United states or the ... has an effect\n... is deputy director of numbers usa which does great work\nOn immigration issues because by that standard I Would imagine that if the current victims of criminal gangs you know of all of them could get together and a caravan it'd probably be\nTens or even hundreds of thousands of people and if they left I'm sure the criminal gangs don't go out of business they just turn to the next set of victims until what until you've emptied the country\nSo so it's really not a ... it's not a solution and I think\nI'd even make the case Christian you tell me what to think of this argument that if you take some of the pressure off or country by having some of the people in the worst situation leave knowing that there are still nine million people that those criminal gangs can pick on and steal from because that's what they do for a you know for a living to get them get their money\nThat in some ways you may actually put the solution farther away because the folks who are most vocal most willing to pick up and pack up and leave and go somewhere else or they aren't going to get rid of the the folks who are actually doing the bad acts but they will they may take the pressure off the government to try to fix the reforms and\nRight right I mean there are certainly people that are that are using file all\nThat will probably use the caravan and we've seen it I care of that there are some bad folks that will ... fan and and and try to take advantage of of the fact that you know this caravan coming up they're going to get some are going to get attached and they're going to have\nThe benefit of food and water it's going to make that make the track through through Mexico to the U.S Mexico border but\nBut but but the vast majority of them are ... are good people or people that are willing to work you know they're willing to help out a ... ... ... it's ... ... that's happening out there and and a lot of it is is the responsibility of the government the government now and has\nDone it stops I take a bite him out of us said that that are out there\nYou got these folks leaving the country is going to benefit the country in the long\nNo one Chris thanks so much for having me\nThat's Chris ... numbers usa to your calls now Dan's on the line

push a button to make something work and it doesn't we fix that\nThat's who I think made a colossal mistake\nBecause she decided to have her DNA tested and then she saw the results\nAnd she saw that she was as little as one one thousand Native American which is actually lower than the average person who lives on the north American continent and then she and her staff I assume she consulted with her staff\nSaid let's give this to the Boston Globe and let them put it on the front page and that will convince everybody that I Am in fact the Native American I claimed so I could get that sweet job at Harvard\nA L brought a joins me now who's managing editor of the stream el welcome back to the program and do do you think that Elizabeth Warren made a big mistake and there's a big enough to take her out of the presidential sweepstakes\nWell compared to Custer felt that he made a mistake but uh [laughter]\nIt what it did is it definitely lowered or stock I mean if I'm putting money on two thousand two thousand twenty democratic race she just she just got a ... she blew it in a way 'cause\nShe it it it's not so much that you know it's what how she did it it's one thing to take the test I'm Glad you took the test that's cool\nAnd I'm Glad she's proud that there's some that blood in there but to to try to use it as a slam dunk against Trump ... was it was stupid and she looked silly and when you look silly once that gets into the cultural life\nYou're in trouble like Cory Cory bookers Spartacus that you're in trouble you\nKnow you're you're already you're going to take down Trump with that kind of thing I mean come on ... thing really\nDid she really really did some damage to herself with this and it was self inflicted too and and that she could have done released the details in a way to put you put a lady issue and she didn't do it in person was smart enough to do that as a smart enough to be president\nWell the other thing is is out at some level I think she knows that she's not Native American and I think she's known since twenty twelve when it was question then she came up with inadequate a proof of it\nAnd I think this would have been an opportunity I could even see uh if if she had a staff willing to stand up for themselves and say to the Boston I Know it's tough says Abbas boss you're wrong here's what you should do you should go out and said this has been an issue since twenty twelve who was brought up in that election campaign\nAnd I've now done a test and I found out that I'm only at most three percent Native American so you know what I was wrong and if she had done that\nAnd and used it as soon as she still would have been able to say to the public I'm I'm maybe as much as three percent Native American but I was wrong to claim not a Native American status I didn't do it for any bad reason I think she did do it for a bad reason to advance or sell financially and professionally but she can do that\nAnd I think America what is it oh okay and then it would have disappeared as an issue\nWell here you go and she had the ... and she has the perfect um hook is he the ancestry dot ... dot com commercial where some guy say for all my life we thought we were German we went to the you know October fest we dressed up and then we found out what Seventy percent\nIrish there's whatever was I've seen a commercial out\nThere that that deals with this she does is booth that commercial for what I mean that's the way out there a little bit but still the I\n... well no you're on the right track ... you're on the right track ... imagine if she'd said hey you know that ancestry commercial is the guy who thought he was Irish and they found is these are tallying instead well guess what I found out I'm In the same boat and I think people would have laughed they would have said well OK and we'll let bygones be bygones I've seen politicians do it\nBut so few of the I Want your view on this so few politicians seem capable of saying and you know what I was wrong about that but I Apologize and a no hard\nView on this so few politicians seem capable of saying you know what I was wrong about that but I Apologize and are no hard feelings right and and then by twenty twenty if anybody like me tried to bring this thing back up again they'd say she dealt with that she said she was wrong why don't you let that one go\nYeah I heard you're exactly right hurt for tax would have been to like under play under play what ... under play the relationship and they said ... admits she made them in ... she made a mistake people live on it because and again like you said if he made a little bit of light of it and\n[noise] she she wouldn't look foolish there wouldn't be the names out there that are gonna be just as devastating as Dukakis on that tank you know\nOh my God you all boy and when you say that the picture comes back to mind but the other thing or two years later thirty or is he still knows he looks like a few who and Everytime I go to an email from Howard Dean and I'm Still getting ... emails not personally been you know the solicitations I think about that scream\nIt or whatever it was he said that night that in one moment one big scream ended his entire and he was the hot prospects but here's the other thing that bugs me about it now you tell me what you think\nWe hire presidents and senators and governors to make great decisions\nAnd we expect them to to be done in a way that serves all of us and sometimes they involve the life and death sending people to war spending huge amounts of money sinking the country into debt or getting us out\nSo when we hire people to make really great decisions and then we see someone like Elizabeth Warren make a colossal eat bad this she's had six years to think about it she gets the new data in and rather than saying\nYou know I probably have to admit I was just wrong and that this is my excuse to do it she makes a colossally bad mistake and then says by the way would you like me making mistakes from the most powerful office in the world\nYeah what what's interesting is as you're talking I'm remembering what I guess is chief of staff Kelly said about a couple of weeks ago how he she was arrogant and of course she took that as well be strong to the president blah blah blah\nIt does it does and that's a general generals used to that you know tough people you know it's a color arrogant\nAnd say that that's the key to this this thing it's the arrogance of thinking well I've got the the media behind me I'm going to do this and I'm going to jump on Trump that's I think some of the key to key why she thought this would be a good idea and in doing it again it the way she did\nThere's all there's also I think the comedy isn't or ... you can't give yourself a nickname so if you have Cory Booker wanted to be smarter because he needed to arrange for somebody else to call them Spartacus when you call yourself Spartacus doesn't go I work as well\nYeah yeah and that's and that's the thing and they're all all these people are trying\nAll these Democrats who are thinking about two dozen twenty are all trying to nudge the way to the front of the pack in her case I think he's trying to be the foil to Trump see I got him I got well you don't like the ball when you're up you're losing sixty four to nothing\nYou know one sixty fourth Indian is like being down sixty four to nothing spiking the ball you look stupid you know but ... but that study that twenty twenty or so focused on that you're not taking care of business and doing what you need to do to win\nSo tell me this goes back to the presidency\nNow do you think this takes her out of it or does she find a way to stay in it because I mean that would be God's Gift to talk radio I'll admit but not not great for the country or those clear the path for for Joe Biden would say\nIt it makes things easier for the people who are running against or but again with the ... uh news cycle that's so fast\nFor for Joe Biden let's say\nIt it makes things easier for the people who are running against or but again with the ... news cycle that so fast me Kanye West of the White House already seems like years ago\nAnd there you go you know so it made you know again but it weakens her and again she's going to be fighting some people\nWho who who want really want the job too and they're not going to play nice so\nShe can maybe you maybe you can but again once you're once you're in that once you're in that place where you're seeing\nIs not serious which is what one thing she had going for is that she was seen as a serious thinker and now you look silly you've taken away you know some of your say mo Jo some of the thing that made you Elizabeth Warren and that's hard to hard to recover from\nYou know I'll I got a rap during the second but I had one other thought you know who I feel sorry for them this\nIs Democrats who are also Native Americans real Native Americans because it puts them in an incredibly awkward spot do I stay loyal to Mike my a party and because I Believe in the Democratic party I Know there are people who do\nAnd do I didn't support Elizabeth Warren or do I turn around and say I don't care she's not a real Native American she's not one of us as the Cherokee Nation said\nThe the writer continues to call her Pocahontas that continues to\nMake a very big deal about this I just I in my mind keeps going that birth or um [noise] uh\nThe birther thing well you know we still haven't set a precedent\nThat really the poor get that for years and never apologized ADS Obama looked for us but that was an awful\nJoint and in order to do you know that some of us still have serious questions about President Obama's um background we still don't know much about what he took her how he got into his underground\nHis graduate school or into Harvard there are many people who went to Harvard the same time he did including friends of mine when Elon routes one of them\nWho says I was there on campus I never saw the guy so and we don't know anything about and we knew when Gore ran against Bush\nOr for the presidency we knew would Gore's grades where we knew what he took we knew what Bush's grades where we knew Bush got a better grade in science and Al Gore did we didn't we don't know anything about him he was the editor of the Harvard law review but he never wrote in the articles\nFor the Harvard law review so there are lots of questions about President Obama's background but you're right does pass you know who brought this ... this week

right it is you want to join the conversation at talk journalism\nAnd ... that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com you know I remember it wasn't that many years ago\nThat a president named Obama was telling Americans word peak oil we're going to be running out of oil so we have to get away from oil just as fast as we possibly can\nAnd then of course we've seen the energy revolution over about the last decade or so in which America is gone from a big importer and heavily dependent on foreign sources of oil to not only self sufficient but literally enough energy in oil and natural gas that we can literally export a lot of it and we have abundance supply\nAnd we don't have to be beholden to foreign shakes or Venezuela or nasty people like that so what we still have politicians who are trying to push us out from away away from oil um bill de Blasio mayor of New York is calling on cities to you\nHanding off enormous law says that they would otherwise not have a in those pension funds and a ... to the tune for example in New York state of a one point two to one point five trillion dollars over fifty years that has to be made up by somebody\nAh in order to pay people's pensions and you know that's going to be ultimately the taxpayers\nWell and and so if I understand correctly he would like all the big cities who have massive pension funds that have to earn money until the people who are going to get the pensions get paid\nAnd that when if they were to back out of oil stocks I assume they'd put the money into some other kind of dogs and the oil stocks it'd be sold to willing buyers would happily buy them so it won't make any difference to the oil companies\nWill still have plenty of people who combined them but New York will have given a given up on the returns they would have had from the ... you know ... the business of fossil fuels which is still a business that a very much supplies the energy for America so what's what's his thinking I mean do you have any idea what why he wants to do this\nWell it's all part of trying to show that you're virtuous and care about climate change Lars this is all about climate change a as all energy issues tend to be now um and what they're what they're trying to say is that by taking the money out of\nA those returns are those bills they'll simply be taking money away from these companies and they won't have the money and therefore they won't drill wells or something um you know that to me nonsense because the fact of the matter is\nWhen you compare portfolios with energy stocks of all kinds in them versus ones without a the energy\nOr funds perform better and have perform better uh over fifty years so [noise] ... basically what you're [laughter] you're cutting off your nose to spite your face ill in some respects\nI mean aren't because the only way for a city to pull money out we talk about it like it's pulling out a drawer but the only way to pull out of a stock is to sell it to somebody else so you'll have willing buyers who will buy those stocks\nWill win the willing buyers bind them the oil company is an out anything they still have investors who own their stocks in fact I guess they could if the city of New York one step a fire sale and sell their their all their socks and if they announced they're going to do this I assume some of the buyers you're going to say great they're going to give us as we deal\nThey'll end up they may have the I guess they could even take stock they bought for a given an amount of money and ended up selling it to people for less money than they paid for it that's potentially possible\nBut the ... the stock will still be owned by somebody but as you say their stock portfolio they can't replace that stock with the stock that performs as well as the oil stock does so they'll have to take a loss or their pension fund recipients the police officers and the other civil service workers in New York are they aware of what the city is about to do to them\nWell luckily they have someone in in New York state uh the controller who who is in charge of the sudden he has something called a fiduciary responsibility which uh anyone who manages money\nTends to have and you're supposed to watch out for those interests to make sure that you don't make bad investments that take away from the value of those people who own shares in it and those would be the firemen and policemen and civil servants of all kind\nAnd um and he's objecting strenuously to this for the very reasons you and I are discussing because\nServants of all kind and um and he's objecting strenuously to this for the very reasons you and I are discussing because he knows the\nThe record and can show that and can show an enormous loss to the city and the state because it's just a mayor de Blasio it's also Governor Cuomo well\nCan they even legally divest themselves of the stocks of the controller says no this would cause a loss can he prevent them from doing\nIt varies from state to state and it gets a little dicey because you're dealing with these public funds which don't have the same some of the same requirements are obviously because so many of them are under funded\nLars I mean we hear all the time about the states that have massive pension obligations that can afford them Illinois and New York California um and\nAnd so there's a little more leeway in that situation but the for the person in charge are they still attempt to live up to the fiduciary responsibility so uh it's not as iron clad is if you were dealing with a a U.S chartered bank or something like that\n... well it would be interesting to see what they do because I I I just I I think it's highly irresponsible for them to do this and the other thing is New York city itself can't run without fossil fuels candidate they can't run on diesel gasoline and natural gas\nUh no it would have a very very hard time and the northeast is getting increasingly\nIn bad shape as a consequence of bad decisions that won't allow pipelines rebuilt and that sort of thing so uh we'll see what the winner holds but ah last winter they barely escaped death and uh it's it's probably gotten worse\nAh and if we get a cold winter will will be able to see ... laboratories of democracy Lars\nYou know it'd be interesting uh I I Know it's it's just fantasy but can you imagine if the big oil companies are said to New York city you want to do that fine you want to get out of fossil fuels fine we will stop delivery of fossil fuels to all your filling stations you know we won't cut off the\nYou know the oil heat that some people still depend on but we are going to stop supplying gasoline\nAnd will do it for a week to see how you like being without gasoline and be entirely out of oil can you imagine I mean as much as Manhattan runs on mass transit they also run on ... and cabs and diesel powered buses and the like\nCan you imagine this and Jazz Can you imagine where they'd be fossil fuel a liquid fuel deliveries stopped to say filling stations and the and the local airport\n[noise] ah that would be one of those what did President Obama used to always tell us that it's a a ...\nMoment or [laughter] something like that teachable moment teachable moment\nAnd just say you want to try it well I'll tell you what will just slow it down we'll cut our deliveries to half\nAnd and the New Yorkers who who ... who didn't get a chance to see the gasoline station lines of the early Nineteen seventies could sit in line for an hour or two waiting for gasoline I Know they blame the oil companies\nLike that they'd be working while they're in school\nAgain why you're Twenty one twenty two year work when I was kind of natural April\nWe wouldn't have a well you know that that student debt crisis if these kids work while they were in school to pay for their education now is that so unreasonable\nNo and and specially Steve I remembered not only I worked all the way through the beer an average in school but I did and then I took part time class after that\nBut I knew people who in the summertime said they'd go and do the hard dirty jobs in the summertime and they'd rack up three or four thousand dollars in the summertime because they live at home with mom and dad works some dirty job make a bunch of money put it in the bank\nAnd they'd have half their half their tuition paid by the time they got back to school and they didn't have to borrow it\nAnd by the way it allows those kinda people 'cause I remember when I was in college my junior year I live with four guys in the house to model and\nFinancial aid and the other two were working which to do you think got a better you know get more out of their education you know ... and Steve I had to find your work and actually had to work to earn it so they actually knew the value of the education if you give something away to people for free they're not going to value it right I mean so I think\nWould be an area we could get a lot more workers we need to get the skills for the workers but you know what the the employers will give these workers the skills they will train them out of the job they will train them how to use a forklift or how to drive a truck or\nWe'll give these workers the skills they will train them out of the job they will train them how to use a forklift or how to drive a truck or you know be a welder or you know all these set by the way it ... you know what how drivers earning not and twenty thousand dollars oh\nLet me tell you I ran into a couple of guys who would come to a station event a listener event\nAnd I was younger guy and they just were friends\nAnd I said what do you do to the older guy and he said I run an electrical contracting business I said you know I tried to talk my step son into that I said I I Know there were both union and non union training programs where they would hire you and the rate two years ago was fourteen fifty an hour so it's like twenty nine thousand a year\nAnd every six months if you stayed in a program where you went to a class four hours a night for one night a week so it wasn't you know it was an asking\nYou to go sixteen hours a day all week long that at the end the tuition for was eighty bucks a month and it was unofficially state approved process where you at the end of four years you had eight thousand on the job training hours working at us and then and then you had six or seven hundred hours\nIn a classroom and every if you stayed in the program you started and fourteen fifty every six months your paycheck went up by a buck fifty an hour\nThree thousand bucks a year out\nAnd by the time you've finished you were thirty five dollars an hour Seventy grand a year that you could salary while I said to those guys said so that's where you're hiring your journey man he says large we can't get journeyman for thirty five bucks an hour he said we're paying forty\nTwo dollars an hour that's Steve that's Ninety thousand dollars a year to start as a journeyman electrician\nAnd you know what this is the same of that story is\nMeanwhile we spent two hundred thousand dollars and you know at cost the taxpayer to put these kids through college\nAnd a half of them are walking out with a sociology degree or ethnic studies degree or political science degree and guess what they're not jobs for a political science degree or a sociology degree you got to be able to do something you know and this was a failure or education system liars we're not preparing\nYou know these kids the twenty first century for the twenty first century house when I was in high school I don't know if you add this we had shop class\nSo we do know that we did not have any market\nYou know what they have their touchy feely classes now [laughter] it's just it's the education system is not a parent we spent\nTwo trillion dollars a year our education system hours but we're not preparing the kids for the job so they can compete with the Chinese and the Indians and Europeans and it's one of the biggest failings of this country we got to ... you know we've got to turn that around because there are there probably ten\nMillion Americans of working age that could be working and should be working but I don't even people with disabilities and it just because your dad back or something like that doesn't mean you can't work on the assembly line but you could be it over a driver or could you know work as a clerk I mean we need we need all hands on death by how how everybody working\nI've got I've got a suggestion Steven that is that in all these communities have got rid of the shop class and maybe even got rid of all the physical facilities what would happen if they went to some of the industries in their area and said hey we want to teach kids how to do shop but we need we need to\n... we'll give you the space in one of our buildings but what we need is we need some ... some ... and all this stuff for my shot glasses and and we're going to teach these kids how to do it and then you can do the final you know O. J. T. when they actually get on the job I have a feeling there industries out there would say we're not be happy to do that's\nHappening now that is happening the problem is they can't get enough kids to sign up for the classes well we moved to an ethic or somehow it's terrible to act to work with your hands in this country\nThat is sad Steve Moore is the author of\nWell we moved to an ethics or

is that fantasy actually becoming reality is that a bad thing or a good thing\nI thought we did invite Dr Michael Guillen on who's an author Emmy Award winning science correspondent for ABC News appearing regularly on good morning America Nightline and world news tonight and the host of the History Channel series where did it come from Dr going thanks for taking the time tonight\nHey Lars uh it's my pleasure I literally just got off an airplane from Amsterdam I'm In New York a lot of the book so you're you're my first time in a taxi cab I Hope this works\nI Am glad to hear it or you know and and the thing is I Hope you're not ... like because I've taken some of those long flights a few of them and and they're not fun [laughter]\nYeah isn't it especially since I started this morning from crack out all and why I was speaking yesterday to huge crowd and that went from Krakow to Amsterdam and have New York but you know what I'm feeling good and large it's good to hear your voice I'd rather it\nWas nice to talk to you as well so he is I mean we've seen the horror shows that are some of these science fiction movies about robot wars but would it be the worst thing in the world if\nSome of the battles that I guess have to be fought we don't have a worldwide conflict going on right now we're kind of in a in one of the most peaceful period in human history uh so yeah what would it be a bad thing if the combatants were machines rather than human beings\nYou know I I I think the short answer is no as long as they're all robots um you know there's the concern right now the largest is um there there is some\nOh we lost in ...\nNo I dare I say you were gone for a second and I was worried about you heading for a tunnel is if people want to get new there are ... you were saying no\nI I uh yeah hopefully it at some point I don't know I was saying that I Know I don't think that it's a bad thing that robots takeover combat you know said human lives and that's a good thing that concerned though is that\nWe're in countries are not up front about this uh so there's some question about it but a country like Russia for example\nHave been pretty a pretty clear that they want to create robots that will battles human\nAnd and that will have and this is and this is the kicker liars will have the ability to decide that that to to kill or not they'll be completely a ton of us mhm do you can imagine what kind of a or a scenario that can create\nUm if you have robots that have been given permission to go kill people\nI'm so that that's the concern but if it's all robot warfare and they become our surrogates in effect that you know it was less of a last robot stand is the winner um I don't think that's a bad thing you know I recently in Japan for example when they had that nuclear power\nA disaster they sent robots and to check check out the the melted core\nSo in cases like that we have very dangerous situations or ... outright combat I think that's um that's not a bad thing for robots take over from us\nLet me ask you this though doctor because we've had\nThe smart ends and smarter devices I mean the the the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were dumb bombs I mean they were ... yeah we were electronic to some degree but they were dumb and then we have smart bomb you're going to actually steered themselves\nSo when we talk about whether or not we would use a machine to fight against human beings human warriors are rather than putting our own people's lives up ...\n... where are we talking about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin and philosophical questions about if you can employers smart weapon to steers itself to the target and now you have a smarter weapon that not only steers itself to the target and decides which\nThe point of smart weapon to steers itself to the target and now you have a smarter weapon that not only steers itself to the target and decides which target to take out is there much of a topic will difference at the end of the day\nOr a good question Lars and probably not at the concern that is so all you need is one country to decide that they are going to create a toddler most combat ride robotic combat\nAnd that's going to force the hand of every other country to do the same thing so suddenly we're going to find ourselves\nIn a kind of a ... situation of the oval arms race during the Cold War when you know a Russia said well I have you know X number of evolves and us that well we have ... plus one number of Avon and you know ah that that can just escalates a situation where it's very very critical um\nI you know we're entering into some very unknown territory bottom line I think for for me looking at the immediate future and even right now\nUm the the thing that gives me the greatest concern our robots that are going to take people's jobs it's already happening and or in my new book uh uh the end of life as we know and I cite some studies recently that said you know up to fifty percent or more jobs right now\nCan be automated an hour and not just blue collar jobs large white collar pink collar\nOn a jobs and and that can sense because if you put people out of work what are they going to do\nWell my doctor I I Love this conversation we needed a schedule more time but we'll do that in another time because let me ask you didn't every forklift on a dock that unload just shift ship take away jobs of\nOf ten or twenty guys who would have used their backs\nOr a or a hand truck to manually you know so you got a whole bunch of strong guys and I think it was probably almost exclusively guys picking up sacks of grain or Saxon something or boxes or something and hauling it off and all of a sudden we have a a crane in a forklift\nAnd we didn't need to know those guys but we found jobs them doing other things were society did hasn't always been were progress has gone ...\nYeah and that's kind of the argument that ... make a movie we saw that even as recently as computers you know when computers took over you know we lost a lot of secretaries a lotta secretarial positions and others but then we created Silicon Valley\nWhich you see no point in huge numbers of people so in the best case scenario Lars that will happen that the for every say job takes over it'll create another jobs\nFor people who are who need to maintain those robots but there is a critical critical difference between a forklift or you know other kinds of mechanical aids we invented in the past and that is the robot is not\nDesigned nearly to do a single task it's actually designed to replace us period right and so we have computers now that are actually being developed to maintain the computers we have computers now that are even replacing a or threatening to replace computer ... a software developers\nWhich is the ultimate irony right that these computer developer is creating the robots that are going to put them out of a job so it's not\nI I'm waiting to see what will happen but that is the most optimistic that the most pessimistic though and and this is the pessimism that shared by some very credible people scientists of studies is that there won't be a um jobs created\nTo ... to offset the jobs that are lost\nAnd you know we often talk about robots taking over the world and revolting against humans or so forth but the thing that I discuss in my book that we really need to take\nWe often talk about robots taking over the world and revolt against your lives and so forth but the thing that I discuss in my book that you really need to take seriously is that people were if they find themselves\nYou know out of a job in their livelihood are stolen something and then I give examples of ... that was the opposite is still not once twice three times you know then what if people are going to do and that and that is a very real a danger and people in Silicon valley have what are all stuck out houses\nA witch and they'll be very upfront about about it that that's where they're going to treat it you know the ... ... if you know what hit the fan so um we don't know yet and that'll be great we still have control over it and that's why I've written this book so that people will be well armed can help make why\nWell I Want you to do that and maybe you and I could get together will make a business creating wouldn't shoes that can be thrown into the gears of the robots what what\nThere are fifty million and that one on on these specific programs would make them justify other than that take the whole deal we not department of Energy Department of education and simply do away with it there's a trillion dollars right there isn't it\nYeah well ... ... you and I were the same room right now I'd give you a big hug language\nBut specific I was like let's go back to the penny plan for a second yeah that's the one percent spending reduction act\nThat was introduced in this Congress by congressman Mark Sanford who unfortunately lost his primary been won't be returning to Congress but he has pushed that you cut one percent across the board of one percent of non interest spending so it doesn't apply to interest on the national debt but it applies to everything else you do that for five years you balance\nThe budget and then that bill would cap\nSpending at Eighteen percent of gross domestic\nProduct basically Eighteen percent of all economic output in the United states uh for for the foreseeable future that's what that bill would do\nThat would solve a lot of our problems in terms of the the looming entitlement and not sovereign debt crisis that we face here in the United states is the the problem here is we're looking at European welfare style or a rates of federal spending within a short time we are talking the next Twenty years that's what we're going to be spending and we cannot produce you cannot have\nStrong economic growth\nYou cannot create incentives to work in safe\nWith that level of spending it's going to crowd out private investment as people will be investing into government T bonds rather than investing in their business or the economy right those are the problems were ... those are problems we face and you're not going to be able to produce the amount of revenue unique because people are simply are going to be ... to work with the with the level of taxation well going to be needed\nTo to lower death\nOkay Jason another idea just wild I Do right now we have seven point one million unfilled jobs in America and I would if I were king but we're not a kingdom but if I were King I would say All right we're going to immediately say to every single state we're no longer paying for any social welfare benefits for this class of people\nEverybody who is above the age of Nineteen let's say and below the age of fifty five so working age able bodied son to mind\nA and we'll start with the kids who have no kids who the people who have no kids at home but we're soon going to get to the people who do have kids at home and say\nYou have to go get a job there seven million jobs go get one of them but we are like Paul ... page did a main saying we're not paying ... we're not paying food\nStamps for example he cut the food stamp rules by Seventy five percent in that group of people immediately when he said you have to work or you don't get food stamps and a lot of people just simply quit\nNow that would have to say but at least tens of billions wouldn't it if we did that to you know Medicaid food stamps tennis and all the rest of that razzmatazz oh abs\nAbsolutely yeah I Know and look the house to to their credit I mean I'm not the biggest fan of House Republican leadership but occasionally they do something right and they tried to do that in the farm bill this year was to add worker ... to uh to food stamps I'm ... and the granted the savings were reinvest it into work training programs which kind of a\nIt didn't defeat the purpose of just defeated the it just took the savings out of the bill but it would have saved billions of dollars\nA unfortunately the Senate decided not to pursue that in fact the Senate voted down I'm In an amendment offered by senators to think of Mike Lee and Ted Cruz that would have put welfare or work apartments on a snap benefits or food stamp benefits or the Senate's been has been and\nWill continue to be the source of most of our problems are and moving a more fiscally conservative agenda because there are too few fiscal conservatives and the Senate\nEven if we get a few more senators in November\nWell let me look that certainly numbers will improve their there are some ... there's some interesting prospects this year in terms of Senate races and I hope to see ah some of those come to fruition but [noise]\nYou certainly numbers will improve their there are some ... there's some interesting prospects this year in terms of Senate races and I hope to see uh some of those come to fruition but\nI'm the plot we have a problem you\nWe may be able to do things that we weren't able to do with more senators a Republican senators in the Senate but um you still have to ... it's all a numbers game at the end of the day and like one of the reasons we got a spending deal in February that blew up spending caps by three hundred billion dollars every two years is because we do not have enough fiscal conservatives not just for the Senate but the entirety of Congress\nYeah I wouldn't even mind seeing some reform over the Pentagon I still remember ... you know you and I've talked about this there was a guy named ... very smart guy and he was kind of he effectively was the CFO at the Pentagon you know he was the chief financial guy\nAnd I said why don't you know get the savings especially when you're having things bought for you that you say the Pentagon does anyone want this but Congress forced us to buy it\nAnd and he said we can move about three quarters of one percent of the Pentagon budget to Congress locks the rest of it down and we don't have any control over budget well you couldn't run Nike or Boeing or any of those companies if you said\nYou can change the budget but only this three quarters of a run for the rest of it yeah he's locked Jason I'm up against a break but ... during the great work to do it freedomworks and thank you so much with the time
