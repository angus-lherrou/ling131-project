cutie a Tucson news and talk\nWhatever wind ... dot com [laughter] Lars Larson show when\nAmerica is in a strange place these days we saw the circus like confirmation hearing of judge Brett Kavanaugh this scandal is charge against him and Democrats who demanded an FBI investigation predictably even after the president agreed to such an investigation and the independence sex crimes investigator brought in to do the questioning says that Christine forged testimony\nWouldn't even support criminal charges of of salt now entered a time in America were crazy allegations can be made against men and women\nThat doesn't even matter if they can be proved the person who's named as politically and professionally yet\nAnd it's a modern scarlet letter that apparently only applies to conservatives think of all the Democrats mayors and governors and members of Congress soup and reliably accused of terrible things the God help you if you're conservative that goes double for supporters of America's Choice for greatness Donald J tropical\nLars Larson show on went on for one taking the AIDS Tucson news and talk [laughter] Lars Larson show\n... nice so now the United states needs a new UN ambassador but it was kind of took everybody by surprise that Nikki Haley\nFormer United States governor was going to leave her posed as UN ambassador for the United states she's done a bang up job and by that I mean she's played up she's articulate and she's smart\nAnd she got the reward of sitting in the White House and having the president wish her well as she leaves her post I can understand why should want to do it\nShe's got teenage kids at home and she spent six years as a state governor\nWhich means she's been tied up with governments while her kids have been getting older I understand her desire to go home now the United states need somebody equally tough to take her job and start to represent the United states there and be tough with some of the bullies because believe me\nThat United Nations headquarters is full\nOf boys so Lars Larson show on went out for one taking the AIDS Tucson news and talk\nFor a time share repressed and every mom is a super mom but showed off a little more than others I think actually get from Minnesota for example thirty nine weeks pregnant she woke up last week to find her husband Andrew gasping for air so she called\nNine one one that reading at All right now\nFor example thirty nine weeks pregnant she woke up last week to find her husband Andrew gasping for air so she called nine one one\nIs that right in that All right now just pull him down to the floor [laughter]\nYou've never done CPR before but she did it this morning one\nTwo three great hauling up\nThe paramedics got there and really tend to the hospital they put them into an induced coma well actually who was scheduled to be induced the next day waited anxiously\nI kept telling him the whole time he was slain or in his coma but I was not going to have the baby and so he woke up hospital\nMoved their beds together into the same room Andrew woke up and actually did give birth afterwards a call from the dispatcher who helped her through\nAnd I'm very happy to know that Andrew is doing better and congratulations on the birth of your son went on what it's worth Sherry Preston ABC News\n[noise] welcome\nLine is that Americans most unified and we want to show the world that we are United together in peace and love and harmony is fellow American citizens who ... you know the hungry like our country ... every day we are showing the world just how truly great we are\nYeah yeah absolutely we do need to unify but the thing and when I talk to people is it's okay to have a different point of view it is and it's okay to even at times argue the problem\nIsn't so much that it's the way that we see each other\nAnd we no longer see each other because of our tribal is because we're cloaked in the red and the blue or whatever it is we no longer see each other as human beings as Americans\nWe see each other as an enemy that's the that's the issue right there that is the the the big issue\nI'll say this wrestling fans get it [laughter] wrestling fans they understand that it's it's theatrics of all the things to turn to go wrestling\nRational are you saying last get it\nWell yeah don't you guys think that it's a it's fake\nFight we know are are you sure you're\nYou get a political wrestling which is what we have now they don't always get the motion bode well when we\nWhen we talk about unifying about like hey let's all come together and hold hands it's like hey we just agree for a second\nTo not be Richard Stone and other\nAnd that will treat each of like human beings and we can vigorously defend our positions and we can fight for the things that we think are right and in ... you know but at the end of the day we can at least part as friends as they are I you know what I didn't convince you didn't convince me but you know no hard feelings\n[noise]\n[noise] oh God it's just so it is so funny it is I I just just\n'cause I get it I'm getting it now getting people I mean the minute this came out and I did a video and you can pick it up to Facebook and and\nAs I'm doing it I'm getting people that are typing in hey chat MS\nAnd out and I did a video you could check it out the Facebook and and as I'm doing it I'm getting people that are typing in hey chat MS and is the enemy or CNN ... started this and it's\nAnd I'm just like oh God why does everybody have to be right all the time like\nWhy is there you get that every day with I'm sure a lot of you to on your like you know if you misspell something you know do a hundred things at once man I'll be tweeting I'll be doing a video of doing the show and do all kinds of things that will put something out there and ... and ... now misspell a word\nOr I'll miss a an you know I'll miss a comma or something and somebody's like you miss that I'm just like wow this is why you have no friends\nNobody wants to hang out with you 'cause you're always have to be right person\nAlways have to be right person is always alone were going out now who's going Jim a camp and the guys the guys always gotta want up me and he's always got to be right Ken hang out with that guy the guy so fun like I you know ... everybody's got one like that and if you don't have a friend like that if you\nIf you don't have a friend like that it's you three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... shows your Twitter so I've I've got a a poll up\nAnd it's about monsters 'cause it's Halloween time and Halloween came out last week which will dominate against the box office probably about thirty five million dollars or what's the what's the monster what is the one what's the slasher the monster the\nCreature that you would say is the best of all time\nUh and we give you a few choices and then you could write years in a uh right now Michael Meyers number one number two Freddie Krueger number ten Jason Vorhees then I've got a lot of like creature Black Lagoon Dracula\nOr things of that and they nature that people are are are charming in too and it's funny because Freddie changed everything didn't\nBecause Freddie Krueger unlike Michael Meyers and Jason friday talked she had a personality that's what separated him from the other two who are maybe more menacing [noise]\nBut friday brought person out three two three five three twenty four toys ... best in show is your twitters Jeff and Jeff [noise]\n\n\nSuch as\n\n\nAs far as we become a nightmare for you do you dream of getting a full night's rest boy am I going to have those days are long behind me\nBased on my pillow I'm sleeping like a baby these days and so can you my pillow adjust to the shape you want and need tossed those flat worn out pillows and letting my pillow changed the way you sleep wherever they're the one and only solution to your sleepless nights my pillows are made right here in the usa with a hundred percent machine washable and Dr ... Khan\nA Kamala Harris has an interesting some sort of package I don't know if that's for certain but it looks like it and then Tom ... who is the uh the billionaire and California who's spending a ton of money trying to impeach President Trump\nOr so it's it's but it's it looks like at least at this point in time they've got the person and\nGood riddance to do bad rubbish now let's talk about things that are happening continuously we're moving towards the midterms and they're still something out there called the caravan and it's coming here and it's very very interesting remember this guy I don't know if you guys ever heard of this guy before\nBut this was a back a few years ago that he said this\nVery generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who enter the country illegally\nAnd those were for them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked circumventing\nThe line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully\nOr the become immigrants in this country\nBritish filled you ever heard of that guy he goes by the name of let me see he at that time he was coal Senator Burr rock Obama did he go into any sounds familiar um let me give it a Google oh can you give it a good oh yeah that's where I used to be president United States\nUnder Brock Obama did he go daily sounds familiar um let me give it a Google okay you give it a good oh yeah that's where I used to be president United States so that was when he was center\nSo we got all these people coming here and of course things have changed because\nYou can change your mind if you believed in you know a a traditional marriage and you are a a bronco bomber or the Clintons and you can change your mind and I don't know if you you okay that's fine that is what it is but I think what he said there was was was fairly fairly good and we've got these people coming here\nAnd and we've got to ask our questions what in God's name are we going to do\nWith this because we've got to start doing something don't we we just can't continue on the way we've been doing it\nIllegal aliens should not be treated the famous people who entered the U.S legally\nI voted on numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a a a barrier to try to prevent um illegal immigrants from coming in\nWe simply cannot allow people support in for the United states undetected undocumented bunk shirt\nRight so there's that so so we would know is it that Brock Obama fellow I'm he I'm sure he went on to do something great but that other lady uh uh I think her name was a Hillary Clinton she cheated some stuff too and Chuck Schumer of course as we all know of of the Cherokee movies fame they\nThere's a lot so those are three of them\nJust stuff like that the factors that are coming here and they've all jumped ship if you will as far as what side that this now doesn't\nHelp them to be this way it only hurts them so they've got to go to the other side and said you\nKnow government in the region seems interested at all in stopping the migrants as they move for Texas once they arrive in Texas across the Rio Grande river the group will inevitably be met by West Wing lawyers who specializes in manipulating are dysfunctional immigration system and they're all but in for permanent residency in this country if\nHistory is any guide and that of course is the main reason so many of them are coming now one of our major political parties strongly supports all of this that's out speculation that they say it out loud often they do when they did\nWhen they didn't say it out loud but they said that it's not right now they said out loud that it is right\nOr that they at least gets it goes back to the the the the spilled milk analogy agave yearly both sides reach for a glass of milk it spills on the floor or we all know it needs to be cleaned up and instead of actually doing anything about it they argue over it and it just sits there that's kind of what this is a site\nIn general\nAnd there are some outliers in certain areas but in general we kind of you know we all kind of want the same thing right we want comprehensive immigration reform we just differ on the way that we think it should be not right we we differ on some of these things\nAnd this is one of those things where just depending on the time of the year what the weather's like which way the wind's blowing that people jumped do side to side and the Democrats are made no bones you no bones about it they are now part of hey come on we're fine with this where at one time they used to say no you can't do this\nWe are our strength and all the men that we are have faced hollering country we're coming in\nThe Central America many you're at risk if they qualify for a solemn we believe there should be\nWe're living in the\nCentral America many are at risk if they qualify for a solemn we believe there should be our process and what's the case can be heard in a fair manner protecting the individuals what's the Democratic party's message about the caravan we're\nA nation of laws and the laws that are on the books they deal with issues of refugees and asylum status and our laws require that may be treated with dignity and given that process\nYeah so they want to welcome that's it it's it's a political game and it's frustrating and I as\nI've talked to just as many people on the left in the right\nThey want to see something done and and like I said this is where we differ on watch we we want the same thing we want immigration reform that's done right most people I talked to on the right\nThere Ninety nine percent of them are like you like I don't care about the DACA kids what happened how they were brought here that they should be allowed to stay here for all intents and purposes there's as American as anybody else they want immigration reform done right\n\nAnd they know that the walls not going to be the end all the bill and they realize that it's much bigger than that and they want to see the laws enforced\nThe people I talked to on the left the the people who are common sense the the the middle of us the exhaust the majority they want the same thing they may not agree on the wall but they don't want to see people flooding here\nThey don't want to see this continue to happen they don't want to see the visa program completely ignored the way it has been they don't want to see the ports completely ignore the way that we differ on what we should do\nOne side maybe wants to crack down a lot harder\nThe other side wants a maybe not the crackdown is hard both sides want to see employers held\nAccountable\nIt's just how do we get there we differ on the path that we do we've got to start doing something now because now here there's a third caravan on the way here and you're just like a third of third care\n[noise] but let me let me give you a snapshot of what's going to happen they're going to arrive give or take last week\nIn November most likely the first week in December it won't be the size it is now because it all of start to break up the closer it gives the border because they're gonna start just wander off Arizona California those kinds of things and nothing will get done\nAnd a good majority of these people will end up here in America there'll be giving a date to go to court of which a majority will show up but it won't be for a few years and who knows what'll\nHappen in that time three two three

Semitism in America\nFor for any form of religious or racial hatred for prejudice\nDepresses obviously racist is obviously demagogues the opposite condos emphasis on the stump so National Center at all the stuff we've said without this Fox News out of the Republican Party what's happened to where the is there were both corrupt bankrupt his two sons that were hollowed out and waiting to be taken over by Donald Trump they've been taken over by Donald Trump than there were\nCourse much worse much ugly replace them they were five years ago ten years ago ... years ago [noise]\nUh that is John Heilemann\nOn MSNBC\nOr who sounds more filled with pain at this moment Donald Trump or John Heilemann\nAmazing really it's [noise]\nI mean I understand that the liberals like high all men are upset that the Republicans actually win again under Trump\nPrefer when Republicans are losing\nBut our praised for their tone\nThe liberals prefer I mean so you oh isn't it isn't you know whether it's you know John McCain God rest his\nSoul or George Bush or Jeff Flake they preferred a Jeff Flake type of person why because Jeff Flake a loses is\nEighteen percent approval rating in his own state they don't like someone like Trump or actually wins so when you when you must be hating\nDonald Trump loves the American people he loves the American experience he wants more Americans to be prosperous and he wants more Americans to be able to now live in safety and prosperity a sound fiscal policy sound foreign policy that's directed to the betterment of the American people\nIt's fantastic when the world is doing well it's great when\nA other countries' prosperity is is rising but the president point when he when he says you know America First Ali means is all just like with other countries are policies are going to be directed to making our lives better not anti Semitic not racist it's pro American\nAnd for a lot of folks out there the idea of being you're pro American itself as offensive\nThey don't they don't like this idea that you're pro American they think America is the best country in the face of the earth because that means that you by implication are criticizing other countries and that instead we need to be part of a\nGlobal understanding with their global rules in global there is a global order and the and so when the president talks about globalism global is\nThat's what he's referencing we have a sovereign right to determine our own destiny\nOur own set of rules for our own people our own policies for our own people that's what he means it must be ... understand that I think they get that perfectly well\nBut it it again it does not surprise me that this is where the left goes in the weekend of this the aftermath of this horrific act of evil Mike in Virginia very quickly line three Mike\nYes it's great to talk to you Laura I'm until the media and the Democratic party understand that there's three hundred million people in this country and that there is a small percentage that are going to be ... nuts and\nCrazy so um there's\nSeeing that there's a small percentage that are going to be ... nuts and crazy so um there's nothing we can do about them\nAnd if Donald Trump had not\nSaid America First do you think this guy would have not done this I mean again I'm saying it says that to connect to the ... it's just a desperate last minute push for voters in the mid term cycle where the Democrats might not win as many seats that they thought\nTo me that's a cynical play here is bringing Trump into you're listening to your healthy radio addiction we continue\n\n\nGuys good news the outrageously expensive little blue pill is now generic which means you can get the prescription medication to treat eating an affordable prices and him make that extra affordable right now get your first month's supply for free oh you pay is just\nEvery major University in America\nI'm supports students for justice in Palestine this love for you\nIt's a University in America I'm supports students for justice in Palestine this love footing hey group ah nobody does anything about it so you know\nBlaming Donald Trump or just exposes\nA the bankruptcy of the left and the Democratic party in particular I think the more they try to blame Trump for everything or the less credibility they have the more people will listen to what Trump is saying that's my view\nThere was a um we'll get to this mom and they were trying to drag the former rabbi and the current rabbi\nOf the tree of life synagogue into you know political conversation I'll get to that in a moment but the the never Trump ... a former conservatives I don't know if they were ever conservatives again on CNN Today use this as an opportunity\nTo trying to smear the President Bill Kristol spoke let's listen\nIf if the president wanted to come to our synagogue Newsweek and make some talk I Would say no thank you for now it doesn't mean I don't think he's our president I just think he does bear some responsibility for this climate and that's you know ... and we don't need him we don't need him to help us overcome this\nRight here we don't need him but they're still in office and there is no opportunity well I have a different view I think there is an opportunity for him to to speak out a and to answer take accountability for\nYou know crystal is that these ... these people and there are truckers are just desperate\nOr to justify their positions says Trump has done everything that conservatives have wanted him to wanted actually not only him but Republican presidents to do for just that they have never done so the only thing they can do\nUh assassinate his character which is what they call it simply do\nThis is ridiculous the uh you know ... one one comment a and I I I've I forget it was in response to a question which\nElicited this where one could be done you said it would be have been helpful if there was a security guard in a synagogue or a security guards and lots of synagogues\nPerfectly wise recommendation\nGot attacked by the Democratic mayor of\nForward magazine which is an extreme left wing Jewish magazine blame him he said that Trump blamed the synagogue and blamed the synagogue he made a a perfectly reasonable point\nA they're a nut case is out there uh who will kill a and a synagogue and other other centers schools\nShould be defended but the Democrats and the left are so few ranged over gun control issues\nThat practical steps like this are hard to take\n\nWell I think that's the case and the former rabbi a of the synagogue or the tree of life synagogue was also interviewed and again I'm not blaming anyone in the aftermath of this because people are so upset\nAbout the media really dragging\nThis into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire world\nView this evil anti he was an anti Trump a fanatic that the shooter\nName I Will not use to dignify the airwaves but these airwaves but this is what um\nA fanatic that the shooter whose name I Will not use to dignify the airwaves but you hear waves but this is what I'm John Berman on CNN drag the former mayor a former rabbi excuse me of the synagogue that suffered so greatly let's listen\nHe welcomed the president of Pittsburgh in the wake of this I Do not welcome the president's him I said hey why not because he's the purveyor of hate speech\nThe hypocritical um where'd that come from him um tell me nothing um we have a we have very very strong leadership and the city you believe in values not just Jewish values leaving values and those are not the values of friends and hats and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh\nOr the current event that you know ... forgive me for saying this but I say it as a Jew the Jews are out to lunch on this these issues\nThat first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked\nThe Donald Trump ... uh you know is a counter punch it basically and he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turn it on MSNBC the other day\nA on the coal lawless at a panel everything that there were four people on the panel was the Trump that said I I'm a nationalist\nAnd every single one of them linked that the adults Hitler why because they were in every one of them said nationalist is dictator\nWell actually no I chose not to see any of the nineteenth century figure who created the modern state of Italy he's the one who claim nationalism\nIs a Democrat they just won't find any pretext to link Trump to Hitler a Lawrence O'Donnell on CNBC he said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's\nWhite and then that translates into Hitler the hate against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump is kind of actually funny and as a tax 'em an ally ... light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing\nWell but these people they have done themselves into a whole here\nAnd they they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time\nSince Abraham Lincoln that the Democratic party or any major party\nAs a gone to war against the legitimate Lee elected president assistance\nWhich is what Schumer and Pelosi call their campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy for political party ... we have a system of compromise we have a system where there is a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election\nAnd that translates normally into a honeymoon the Gallup\nEstimate is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds there were boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment the hate is coming from people like this rabbi who insist\nOn demonizing the president of United States which is something that hurts all Americans he is our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush too they called Bush Hitler the Democratic party is out of control and off the rails\nAnd a ... you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that until a ... there are some sober Democrats but they're\nYou know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that until a ... there are ... Democrats but there and intimidated by the party left now um but that they will come out of the closet\nYeah Jeffrey ... I have one and Alan Dershowitz yeah exactly Jeffrey Maier yeah Jeffrey Myers does the current rabbi or who of course\nIt is just devastated by what happened to his congregation to his people he's worshipers and he was asked the same question on CNN Today in responded like this\nRabbi I'm President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue in the aftermath of this do you want him to come\nAround the president of the United states is always welcome I'm I'm a citizen he's my president he's certainly well\nThat's a good answer Neal ... you know every time I go I go to a synagogue I look around ... hopefully that there's a security guard there\nBecause I kind of universities are teaching jewel hatred they they are in our university the curriculum\nAnd the middle eastern studies programs but generally is that you know the Jews stole land the Arab land which isn't to genocide ally\nThe land which Israel was created belong to the Turks for four hundred years previously the Turks have not Arabs and they see the dilemma too because they were on the losing side of the first World War a\n... it just\n... you know there's this than a Seventy year aggression against is to destroy the state of Israel a and yet if you go on a college campus today the sympathies are all with the terrorists\nKnow it's pro pro Palestinian uh the Jews are\nUh the aggressors an on line today and seeing the same thing that did this was caused a anti are both the president's rhetoric and those Jews in the United states who are are helping support him and and continue to give him cover which I'm reading and stuff going\nThis is this is a literally insane I I I have no words to this\nExactly this is the best president or from the point of view of of of Jewish survival uh we've ever had\nA Trump I mean they you know that Komen and I somewhat his kids are Orthodox Jews for crying out two years I mean it's just insanity and are these so called liberal Jews\nEngineering is being absolutely super\nOh wait [laughter] with a superhero who can say your old high without\nFor putting up yard snow two fellows program he lose coverage of feeling I reach steals your fights with if the structural lighter to keep\nAnd it costs less even if you have\nNo flow called new Tucson dot com boom won three nine seven four or five\nWhen you live ... given the\nGum and will be no way in in a\nNew needs are\nTwins I made up their mind they ruin the big bone and this is what will they will be the mail you\nYou you know\nIn in um\nYou need to\n[noise]\nDot com to look at the most sensual information you know during the first one morning news is one of one Eighteen the hate the case you the age Tucson\nABC News\nI'm Scott Goldberg two days after eleven people were shot dead during a Sabbath service in spite of Pittsburgh synagogue the suspect\nWas in court slang fixed and all business the heavy set Bowers answered the judge's questions with a simple Yes sir outside the courtroom us attorney Scott Brady\nOur investigation of these hate crimes continues\nPowers will make his next court appearance November first in the meantime drugs to flight risk people remain jailed without bond Pete combs ABC News Pittsburgh\nHouse as President Trump will visit Pittsburgh Wednesday some people they're about to not to some Pittsburgh Jewish community organizations telling the president not to come until he denounces\nImmunity the rabbi said that he is welcome\nThe president saying a number of times over the weekend he denounces last week's violence and anti Semitism and you feel the ABC News Washington\nSees our ... sending pipe ... pipe bomb like devices the high profile critics of President Trump and the people the president has criticized also was in court this afternoon\nIs expected to be tried in federal court in New York however he will remain here in Florida for the time being as the court will first cash out whether he should be held in jail while he awaits trial a hearing on that is scheduled for friday morning after which say ox attorney Daniel errands and says they'll begin looking at whether they should be taken in New York where there's going to be a status\nHearing to determine whether we are going to waive his removal or want to remove all here in my criminal\nArt ABC News Miami the Pentagon says it will deploy around five thousand troops to the southern border officials say those troops won't be used for border enforcement rather they'll serve in a support role [noise]\nDay the down bounce way out then finished down losing two hundred and forty five points thoughts on track to have the worst month since the financial crisis [noise] you're listening to ABC News [noise]\nThings you find the latest coverage online anytime one oh four one K.

politician\nI don't think that's going to happen\nTrump's not a conventional politician he's going to do things the way he thinks\nAre going to resonate that's where the people are going to advance his agenda consumer spending by the way way up consumer confidence way up a three point five percent GDP last month even with some of the headwinds US Economy has faced\nAnd that's all very good news for this country All right we're going to take a break a with a lot more to get to run to Santa is going to join us of course he wants to win that Senate seat against Andrew Gillum\nAnd uh [noise]\nUh well no I mean excuse me the governorship obviously against Andrew Gillum and focus on the bill Nelson race against a former governor or the current governor outgoing governor\nOr and Brock Obama is in the state this weekend so he's going to end this week you can uh be campaigning for Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson the both the gubernatorial and Senate seats open a and it's tight say they're\n\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former Ford Lincoln and mercury owners or less the skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to call the airbags in their vehicles\nWhat issue right now at this moment in time or is motivating the voters in Florida many are now moving toward you they're panicking on the left clearly but what what ... what one issue do you think is most important\nI think it's protecting Florida trajectory and I'm a candidate who is going to build up the success that Florida's had in terms of our economy\nAndrew Gillum wants to forty percent tax increase that I think voters know that will destroy our economic momentum I'm also a candidate that has a really solid plan to fix some of the environmental and water quality problems they look at Andrew Gillum is somebody that wants to impeach Donald Trump\nHow are you going to be able to get these problems solved which requires consultation with the federal government\nUh if you're out there saying the guy should be peace I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done and then people are really concerned about Andrews record in Tallahassee with respect to crime they've had the highest crime rate in Florida and Tallahassee what he's been mayor and last year they had a record number of murders more murders at any time in ... history\nAnd I've been endorsed by an unprecedented array of law enforcement groups because at the end of the day they want someone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attacked\nLaw enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities they don't want a governor who supports open borders and sanctuary cities and abolishing ice like Andrew does\nNow a ... a piece today and the hill Obama to campaign for Gillum and Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection the Senate ah in Florida how concerned are you about the\nOf President Obama has rock star quality\nUh in Florida how concerned are you about the allure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent\n[noise] so I'm not I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me than he does for\nFor Andrew because I think folks will uh who may not otherwise wanted vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak\nOr when it comes to the Missouri but durable regime and Venezuela so I welcome President Obama how I should be paying for his travel expenses that come down and don't forget you know we have the president of the United states coming down on October thirty first\nUh to Fort Myers in southwest Florida and then likely come again before the election happens and so you\nKnow you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz in Texas um you know that put the race away for Ted and I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWell Gillum is um silver Tunde order I mean that's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about about our by political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric tested he tries to do the cool thing that Obama does\nI I don't think he doesn't do it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last debate with you for our listeners let's listen my grandmother\nUsed to say I have a dog will holler\nMiss the census has spoken a first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he has spoken at racist conferences not calling Mr dissenters races I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nAnd of course the ... are\nLovely is over and MSNBC et cetera said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today\nUm there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boy Connors of Israel these anti Israeli organizations supporting Gillum the ... and you know he's not sign this pledge called dream defenders hum I pledge my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers\nAre of course I'm also an advocate textbook socialist principles the virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera\nUh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum honey respond well yeah\nLike I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew is the one who is aligned themselves with the dream defenders they are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott digestion sanction\nOf the state of Israel they actually organized boy or a flash mob protests in Israel they take special trips or just the target Israel on and so what we're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the gods strip and so he's way out of step on that\nUm and I would never accept an endorsement from a group a that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement is racist they say the police and prisons have no place injustice um and that law enforcement should be defined it so that's what he said\nI'm In terms of the pledge he signed\nPresidents have no place injustice and that law enforcement should be defined it so that's what he said I'm In terms of the pledge he signed on that I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable or in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner and of course that's the FBI agent as part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption\nAnd turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks but want to Gillum fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nWell that's right so he said just last Sunday when we did the CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff\nWell then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message is showing he acknowledge that this price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton\nWas actually paid for by an undercover FBI agent who he thought was a with a local real estate developer and then it comes out just a couple of days ago that that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under wrote almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain nation governor campaign and indeed\nAndrew did not disclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida law so he goes around saying that he's not been investigator isn't being investigated\nBut I Would ask the question what other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and its problems with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating Gillum that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nThe laser ... down to some really simple in these last closing days it's just lazy this is sleazy politics as usual bribes uh people people dangling little benefits and politician jump\nAnd they just jump okay what do you need what do you need a lot of ... ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter if it's a Hamilton ticket or a trip or restaurants it's sleazy\nCorrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly\nHas become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in Florida than definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states then you better get out there and vote for Iran to Santa I endorsed Ron over a year ago\nBecause I saw his leadership and his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled it's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama wannabe Gillum for good leadership it's not it is it's pathetic and by the way\nA Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan\nI heard the Scarborough absurdity if you're if you're concerned about the care of and you're basically anti Semitic I mean you got you know diagram that sends a but the but it looks like Floridians in the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll\nShows that only I'm\nOnly twenty six percent said that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life in the state better\nThirty eight percent said no impact thirty six percent said it's made life worse than forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states uh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now I'm fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not\nTo the United states uh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now I'm fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help the migrants and the caravan\nForty nine percent said we should try to help us kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want him to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on the care of him\nOr this is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally run across our border the fact of the matter is Mexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstance to the nearest refuge they've they've rejected refuge in Mexico\nBecause they think they have a right to override our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum a support the caravan coming into the United states is running mate was out there saying yesterday that we need to welcome in the Caribbean and in the United states um and so you couldn't have\nA more stark difference um for borders Andrew stroke and borders I Want to support our men and women and if he wants to abolish ice", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "29", "locations": [["Pima County", 32.22174,

should attack upcoming student loan debt I'm thirty one years old right now um [noise] what do you want to know when\nYou only know what his upcoming student loan debt\nAlright so uh four years ago to get a promotion at work I decided to go back to school and it did pay off I landed the promotion two years ago and now the loans are kicking in and if I would've got a hold of your show earlier I Would have been paying 'em off sooner but\nI Will I Am debt free uh two years ago we had our first child and we use\nNo you know your student loan that he well yeah [laughter] okay so I'm I'm not that free now I have my student loan debt the\nFifty grand coming up in the Seventeen months I got to start paying for\nA nice not coming up it's there it's just whether you've got to pay it when you have to pay it so what's your household income\nUh it went from only twenty five when we were both working to Seventy five now my full income\nAnd how much of a promotion did you get in return for going into debt fifty grand\n[noise] well I was getting a lot over time in the past so it was kind of a lateral move but it was it showed on paper thirty percent increase my base pay\nIt didn't show on the paper called your check\nNot yet not yet\nWell are you I mean so so far you've got nothing for your fifty grand\nTrue true and I both I've always felt pretty smart with money so I I have a positive net worth right now of four hundred thousand between my four oh one\nBig assets and I'm home equity so I'm not I'm not terrible but I just want to know I\nI think we kinda wing assets do you have that are not home equity or for one\nUh I have a hundred thousand and vehicle fifth wheel toys like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen thousand dollars\n[laughter] [noise] thanks for\nUs for like five five ... five Andy and Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped\nBy because there was a neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but things were going by guys are you think they have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go then we're going to retire from our jobs in ... in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be a uh the the operations\nOf the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... ... all and we'll be rented or we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it up\nTo him and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about\nWhat kind of a you know\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I ...\nAnd what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that\nWho are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the tenant they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands of the land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that\nAnd any of the things that the uh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you and your your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying and it's a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you'd stand you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that ... ability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kinda thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families or adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much in this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it caused this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\nBecause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the farm plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing him on his liability do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThe\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins\nGuy and um\nOkay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins\nOkay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nYou you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before he walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but a whole harmless is\nThat what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest\nRight it's like do you know you were you were walking across the employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not after writing a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases\nFor sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and I have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you sign these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still level\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so yeah I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't have a

American I Apologize that this is something that you've touched on a lot and so I'm new to the baby fat and I know that number one we have the thousand dollar\nAmerican the fine mhm my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm fungus funding and how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get back to baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you OK but um that's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years oh no never happened we really lucky we haven't been laid off you go in and they get\nThree years oh no never happened I mean really lucky we've never been laid off I don't know if you go in and they get home ... I mean within a couple\nOf weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something ... going to work\nOn something when he comes home if they did get laid off so [noise]\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed pause on the whole told them want to make up a vibe you step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as well we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program that functions like a membership club think of it like Costco\nAnd then yeah you'd be a baby step forward and you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income away and um that would be baby step for and I do that first in a rough IRA and then I Do it in a ...\nSome of your income away and um that would be baby step for and I do that first in a rough IRA and then I Do it in a Roth T.

I'm not exactly sure what the best thing to do if I'm not the beneficiary combat it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a child yeah\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's quite a million dollars\nWow it should be canceled okay\nIf it's a whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight and yeah and like my main thing that you know we found out the beneficiary I doubt I mean he's a great guy by not worried about you know that it\nWasn't like I don't care as a guy doesn't matter of fact a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very unlike the greyhound on you know a wild one\nBut it's strange ... long you been married for a long you been married five years and then five years they've not address this issue that strange just wrapped\nIt really I mean they should you should address the issue that they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy on this is a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term\nTo create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a port right of return that when you die they keep your money so that whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you've got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say dad\nOr I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's like I don't want to be paying for something that you know not only that but you have fallen thank you\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yeah cause you to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nYeah I have a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings should come I called it ... from my company and yet\nRetirement savings said comes a thing called a ... from my company [laughter] and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as sad or\n... or ...\n... well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a projected retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total and I've had you know and\nAnd my question is whether the cat has a lump sum yes or ... okay yes\nHere's why okay if you'd die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die [laughter] okay when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefit the money's gone it's gone and I'm like if you live I or as long as you live it's\nGoing to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market so it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you get that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but uh\nIt's still you know if you die then yeah you gotta survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept to block so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal and so you\nAlways take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good gross like mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nAh yeah it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well yeah total total Matt where the assets house and so forth\nNo ... well ... congratulations how old are ya I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire was war that was before that happened\nA millionaire before my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents were eligible young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nOr holdings patterns or because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nAnd scientists home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool is I'm ...

[noise] I'm Nathan Frederica vice president and Mayfield financial inundate protection services incorporated an asset and retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nVolatility is back in a big\nAs markets continue to get tossed around as more economic data keep pouring in and financial reports from various major companies are digested by analysts\nWhile key economic indicators are still showing signs of life in the economy along with a roaring job market and low unemployment\nThe fact remains that interest rates are starting to creep up in a big way and are feared by some to put the brakes on this red hot economy home sales in fact are slipping in some areas with prices falling\nAs mortgage rates have increased giving pause to would be home buyers\nAnd then some companies are reporting that terrorists costs are starting to hurt their bottom lines meanwhile the Federal Reserve continues to dig it heals into the ground on rates saying quote we no longer need to be stimulating the economy unquote\nIt is their job after all to keep inflation at bay\nThis has some on Wall street a little bit concerned as the long term effect of higher interest rates and the potential economic slowdown are still unknown\nAnd when there's a little uncertainty out there Wall Street starts to move in a big way now what does that mean for your money and your retirement\nWell definitely it means more uncertainty if you only rely on what Wall Street provides and here at Mayfield financial we think that is no way to plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nRetirement planning requires a careful thought process that involved many different moving pieces one of those is Social Security another could be a pension and for some the biggest piece is your retirement savings\nAnd when it comes to your retirement savings today baby boomers had been found to hold more stock market type investments than ever before\nPerhaps that's due to the lower returns sometimes seen in more of the fixed income type mutual funds on Wall street and it's also the result of this ten year bull market run\nHowever most financial advisors would agree you shouldn't have too much exposure to Wall Street or you're setting yourself up for potential failure what if another two thousand eight crisis hits us or worse\nThe drop in two thousand eight was so severe and so sudden most financial models didn't even fathom that kind of a loss retirement accounts across the country were decimated savings plans dash withdrawals put on hold income reduced\nWhy would we want to put ourselves through something like that again\nNow you've probably heard the saying before which some attribute to Albert Einstein but who really knows but the saying is insanity is doing the same thing twice expecting a different result\nSo what do we think the right thing to do is well it's definitely you don't want to do the same thing twice and have too much exposure to the stock market so our rates\nWe think the right thing to do is well it's definitely you don't want to do the same thing twice and have too much exposure to the stock market so our retirement planning process at Mayfield financial is a little bit different\nFor starters it's one that doesn't entirely rely on Wall street we've got to get it through our heads that Wall Street isn't the only place they keep our money growing there are much safer alternatives out there\nAnd even with that safety still have the potential to keep growing\nThis is what we call a safe money plan here at Mayfield financial it's an account set up and your name it could\nBe an IRA or rock ... roll over IRA and inherited IRA or a four\nO. one K. or even just regular saving money and in that account you can receive certain guarantees certain protections that even in the worst stock market you won't lose a dime\nSo that's why here at Mayfield financial and the state protection services we feel that what we do is so important we help our clients right here in southern Arizona take some of the wall street risk out of their portfolio\nWe do this using our expertise in safe money planning and create a customized plan for you\nOr at least a part of your portfolio is one hundred percent protected from Wall street risk\nSo if this sounds interesting to you and you'd

important than just a game so don't put your entire nest egg at risk in the stock market\nThere's so many risks from all sorts of different avenues especially right now there are so many economic arrests out there and talk of a slowdown we're seeing action on tariffs and trade wars and rising interest rates\nEven major investment from some of them are telling their clients to get out of the market and that we are quote in the last hurrah of the market I don't care what you think about what's going on in the White House or how the media is portraying everything when it comes down to it\nThe economy and Wall Street are going to do what it does on its own economies are cyclical it's always been that way and it always will and the fact is right now we're seeing signs that were near or already at the top\nAlan Greenspan put it best when during the dot com bubble of the nineties he said he saw quote irrational exuberance\nNow maybe it hasn't reached that far maybe it has you'll be the judge\nSo even if you have a Wall Street portfolio now but you feel like you're safe with your bond funds\nDon't fall into the false sense of security that you think you might have innate bond fund now I spent ten years as a Wall Street advisor and many advisors they don't talk about this but a bond fund or bond mutual fund or ATF\nThey all have the potential to lose principle value you may think that they are safe because they send a bond but unfortunately it's a bond fund that managed by Wall Street and it trades and it moves it has a price\nBut unfortunately it's a bond fund that managed by Wall Street\nAnd it trades and it moves that has a price and it's highly sensitive to interest rates so if rates are on the rise those bond fund values will go down and depending on how fast rates move\nYour principal value in that bond fund could decrease substantially faster than your funding yield in the last Twenty years or so we've been in a downward trend in interest rate environment\nTo where they almost went to zero in two thousand nine\nNow rates are on the rise and we have yet to ever experienced in the history of Wall Street what kind of an effect long term rising rate have on bond funds so what do you do\nHere at Mayfield financial an estate protection services\nFor over twenty five years right here in Tucson we have been a safe money retirement adviser our

listening to worry free financial solutions with your host may even further ego\nWelcome back to worry free financial solutions I'm Nathan Federico a safe money retirement specialist in financial retirement planning there are two separate and distinct time periods in our lives and\nIs the wealth building an earnings phase this is a time when we are working trying to save and it's a time when we contribute to things like for one case to IRAs and other retirement planning accounts and during this time the stock market is one of the most powerful tools on the planet\nAnd should be used heavily in this accumulation phase especially when you're younger there's absolutely no doubting that\nThe second phase in retirement planning is the part where we transition from wealth building too well spending\nThe second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert assets into income\nAnd in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you were a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan and it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some call this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of him and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one pensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now\nMost of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement\nEspecially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives this is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility\nOur of the stock market and if you have a four one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money but if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one case and IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee of income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four O. one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey sailed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they have the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety of principle and guarantees this is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial an estate protection services\nThis is what we call a safe money plan\nAnd we've been doing it here for over twenty five years and we believe and know that for at least they part of your portfolio your four one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income that you can count on year after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and ahead of inflation\nAre safe money plants do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course raw IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income strain that you simply can't outlive\nAll with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no commissions paid by you\nSo what do you need to do you need to take action now before it's too late take action while the stock market is near all time highs you need to take action now before the

this way I'm a promise to you and most importantly to the people of Texas it'll sort of every single day of a six year term in the United States Senate and I won't leave the state [noise]\nThat is a

got great stretch stage presence some of the stuff he said last night I didn't disagree with a ... and and he's realistic he knows that some of these things are going to cost money talked about raising\nTaxes but a lot of what was it that that people took away from the last night was Trump and better\nAnd you set into line that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach have you changed your mind\nI haven't um ... let me let me put it this way I'm there may be an open question as to whether\nThe president than the candidate sought to ... with the Russian government in two thousand and six teams when we saw him on that stage in Helsinki defending Vladimir putting the head of the country that attacked our democracy in twenty sixteen instead of this country and its citizens and the amazing democracy with collusion inaction\nNow let's remember this right so we remember all of that stuff which is a this is not collusion just because he defended him or whatever that you think he did he would shoot him\nDown remember that some people knew things were going on\nHe did nothing about because he thought Hillary Clinton was when he did nothing he didn't do hidden lifted a finger in spending die\nThat of course the president talking about Trump and this\nThing is gone all over political reporter today that the ... investigation\nIs coming to an end ah as far as I think the Trump side of it there maybe some other stuff but the reality is\nThey said you're going to be disappointed Democrats what\nPeople are hearing is there are sexually saying take a deep breath because there doesn't seem to be any there there well there's no there are there without that how about something else\nYou may have wondered when he fired James Comey the principal investigator and what happens in that election whether that was an attempt to obstruct justice but win by broad daylight on Twitter he asked his attorney general Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation always say that some structure and in action\n[noise] what'd you say that would you say that\nWould you really say I mean ... to me you're just this is what you and get ready if they win a house which is a possibility\nYou were going to get\nTax records investigation after investigation and in peach peach peach peach peach peach even if there's nothing to impeach they're going to try to pick\nThe best course to get there so that every member has all the facts and that there are compelling enough to do the right thing is to allow the full independence and integrity or Bob Mueller invested you already\nSaid even though that's not done that he would do to impeach and so according to the constitution that means that the president has committed the crime of trees in primary bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president had committed\nI was like in a impeachment to an indictment there there was enough there to proceed with the trial\n[laughter]\n... just like with Kevin uh he was already in trouble the minute they announced him they're already going against him having never talk to them uh it it's a game that they're going to play and this is what's gonna happen and\nAh he's still going to go after him and this is this is what you're going to see moving forward I don't know [laughter]\nSee you know posters and people who who look it absentee ballots and ballots that are mailed and they look at certain things\nAre there are differing on how close this race is going to be in fact in some areas they think the Republicans are much better shape holding the house ... ... it's interesting to find out but better still for all intents and purposes with all the money he's got trailing cruised by about ten points and I don't see that changing three two three five three twenty four twenty three\nBetter still for all intents and purposes with all the money he's got trailing cruised by about ten points and I don't see that changing\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... shows your Twitter tweet at us yes kids he's the sheriff David Clarke judge ...\n[noise]\nTo show [noise]\nAs fall asleep become a nightmare for you do you dream of getting a full night's rest boy am I going to have those days are long behind me\nThey see my pillow I'm sleeping like a baby these days and so can you my pillow adjusted the shape you want and need tossed those flat worn out pillows and let my pillow change the way you sleep wherever they're the one and only solution to your sleepless nights my pillows are made right here in the usa with a hundred percent machine washable and tribal cotton\nHow do we give them that my my thing is how do we get them to act because you know a lotta times and and I think you know this is\nThe more that you get into the political world you know you're working with the America First action you're you're you're out there and and you're seeing things and you're talking to politicians I'm sure talking politicians on both sides despite what people like the the thing is\nThat neither side has you have to have the stomach to take something some of these these real issues on political yet that the political fortitude the stomach to take these things on and a lot of them they're just they're afraid because they think their jobs are on the line which may be true but the whole point is you're supposed to be they're serving the people not just your job in the party\nIn what I think needs to happen is and that's after November because we have to win in November the GOP has to maintain control both chambers of Congress\nAnd then we can um you know hold their feet to the fire after that because they've had two years the GOP Congress\nThey squandered two years to finally fix this thing they had the numbers they didn't need democratic support although they probably did because you've got some we meet a GOP members on on immigration but it's going to take leadership and I think the leadership\nCould start in the White House but I think the four pillars that the president proposed a new state of the union address was a great start the Congress didn't act on it but he has some leverage to there's certain things that the Congress once we have some spending bills coming up I think one comes up\nAfter 'em or the November election and the president a previously has threatened to veto that and shut the government down because there's no wall funding in there and that's the highlight of his um his uh fixing immigration\nSo you know he could towards some arms some back door negotiations in a lot of this can go on a in the you know in in the back rooms of the ... Congress\nThe negotiating doesn't have to be done out in front but this president has done a great job of messaging and he knows how to tweak these these are individuals in Congress including the GOP\nOr to get something done because he's not doing the president's not doing this for political purposes is doing this because he made a promise to the American people and he was going to secure the southern border and that he was going to\nUm keep these are illegal immigrants from flooding into the country\nThere were a drain on our public resources like the medical system for instance the um uh the school system for instance you have to educate these kids coming into the language barrier so you have to set up new bilingual programs that stuff costs money that that the American people have to pay for I found them interesting in the New York times column and\nThat's the New York times pointed out they're fleeing Honduras because of crime\nA gangs or poverty and no jobs and for a minute I thought they were talking about the city of Chicago or maybe Baltimore and I'm thinking if people in Baltimore American citizens and in American Ghetto who living gang infested neighborhoods climate for high crime like Chicago Baltimore another series a city's\nI'm very few jobs although that's being improved by this president in high poverty where do they migrate to so I suggested in a tweet tongue in cheek to form a caravan and migrate out of the city of Chicago in and out of the city of Baltimore these Democrats strongholds and go find some other areas some other city\nOr whether prospects are going to be better safer neighborhoods better schools so on and so forth\nYeah I mean look I mean get adequate brainy green and some of the areas that\nGoing to be better safer neighborhoods better schools so on and so forth\nYeah I mean look I mean do you get out of ... green and some of the areas out there that are in Chicago that are that that are that are dangerous and and if you really trying to escape the violence or talking to a a\nShare of ah David Clarke America First action senior vice are over there are so you know we've got the the midterms with\nAbout Eighteen days away and the thought is you know the enthusiasm really picked up because of Kavanaugh but like anything it's there's gotta be somewhat of a perfect storm happening\nAnd the facts are that the perfect storm maybe happening with this caravan the likelihood of the house I mean that's that's the big thing 'cause I think a lotta ... I think even up to a month ago\nThe Republicans were essentially in a position where they said you know what I I don't think we're going to hold the house we might pick up a ... a a Senate seat or do they have too many defend over there and especially in in in red states\nBut the house look dead are now their stock that they may save the house what would that do for the president if they were able to save the house and what would that say to do all those Democrats a lot of people out there who who feel it's a foregone conclusion that this this tsunami is coming out this blue wave\nSure there's been renewed sense of urgency\nOn the ah with the the the ... face Republican voters I've censored I travel the country continually and ah I talked to Republican voters there's been renewed sense of urgency\nBecause the cabin on because I think people are seeing what could happen if if the Democrats get control of things one of the things that ... the\nThe RMC about there was NO PLAN to to uh increase the number of seats there were just willing to see this over and say well when my will probably going to lose a few we're probably going to lose um uh some in the house\nAnd there was NO PLAN to increase the number of the the numbers here you have to go on off it's you can't defend in elections\nYou have to have a plan to increase turnout to increase your margin set you old already and I've never seen one from the are and see like you mentioned this talk about well we might hanging onto this we might go there's no hanging on so\nUm you know that's why the president's out there doing everything that he can but look you got to have good candidates and and then the president can't waste of time going to try to prop up some bad candidate\nWas running a bad champagne and thinking you know where the candidate thinks well I'll just called jump in and everything will be okay that's a whole elections working look I'm a veteran of elections I had to run a four times for elected sheriff and in Milwaukee County to county ... million people I had to get people to vote for me\nI was the largest vote getter Democrat or Republican\nUh in my uh in my county and there's a reason for that okay I Know how to get people out you got to have a good message you have to energize people and that's what I'm doing right now on behalf of um uh the president through America First action\nRallying the base so I tell people forget about the polls forget about all these blow hards on TV these talking heads he's put mass dictators\nForget about what you hear about generic ballots forget about blue waves and read some nominees water ... when it comes down to right now\nHis turnout turnout turnout whatever so I can get\nTheir base energized enough to actually participate whether it be early voting on election day\nThat's who's gonna win it's that simple this is not rocket science like pollsters tried to make it talking about a registered voters or likely older no it's the people who are actually going to show up were fill out a ballot and send it in if the early vote and if our side does that and here's what I tell people\nThat I I Can't just count on you I Know you're going to vote you gotta find two or three people\nWho have a lackadaisical attitude about mid terms and they may not vote and you have to inspire and edits\nThe old you're going to find two or three people\nWho have a lackadaisical attitude about midterms and they may not vote and you went up to inspire an energized them take them to the polls with two or three you can probably do that within your family you got a nephew or niece that just turned Eighteen\nOr Nineteen twenty and it hasn't voted yet because the the the demographic uh tends not to\nGet them out there because if we do that if we do like we didn't twenty sixteen we can maintain we meaning the conservatives you know geo period I think the two different things but we can maintain control of this house because that's what the president's going to need to continue his vision\nOf making America great again if the dams ... uh when the house\nI'll tell you right now the the the Trump vision is going to be that in the water get about wall funding forget about fixing immigration\nAt least that's going to be a palatable to\nTo us on the right uh you know you can and they're going to threaten the tax cuts to go to you all you're gonna hear about the next two years impeachment investigation\nThat's what's at stake your gun rights are at stake I mean you know wait till I said there's a lot at stake here and remind people Trump's on on the ballot or so for people who want to our side Republicans that are real fun to jump like well he's not on the ballot here on the ballot or you know the the tax cuts trying to make them permanent\nUm protecting the second amendment the rule of law the Supreme Court that's what's on the ballot come November\nYeah it's going to be very interesting we're not too far away as always

me get the best night's sleep period don't you try to Casper you're going to love yours to Casper is a high quality mattress at an affordable price I sleep cool and comfortable every night\nEven though that's not done that he would vote to impeach and so according to the competition that means that the president has committed the crime of treason primer bribery or a high crime in misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in a impeachment to an indictment there there was enough there to proceed with the trial\nYeah and that's all it's about it's about in the end is slowing down in teaching him knowing full well that you're not going to get him thrown out of office\nAnd if there is no there there were doing to the country's you this is the other thing and this is something we've talked about before you go to potentially put yourself in a situation where you look like such a obstruction is and the whole thing is you don't care about the country you care about destroying Trump and taking out Trump that you put in\nA situation where you you focus so much on it that it hurts the country maybe slows down the growth of the country people start panicking we know how ... confidence and things can be can be wavering at times and waiting and when we started to see things go and you're going to give Trump another opportunity to say look man when I had the house and the Senate\nWhat did I Do unemployment economy ... all of these things were going on they come along boom\nThey put a stop and everything talks about rolling back taxes that's all they want to do talk about doing this that and the other and then what happens everything slows down everything when I was in charge was rolling they come in here\n[noise] boom look what happens and you may give people the right to you know what he's right everything was ruined it was going good it was because we live in a world where\nAnd you may give people the right to you know what he'd write everything was ... it was going good it was because we live in a world where\nIn politics we need the other side to suck now so we feel like we can have a victory he wants to impeach he did not even waiting for the evidence yeah let's impeach\nBut two hundred and forty two years into this experiment\nWhich is the exception not the rule in world history nothing that guarantees us the two hundred and forty third or a two hundred and forty fourth it's up to all of us to stand up for that democracy\nThe best way to do that and so express it on the twenty second of October the first day of early voting and then the than election day on the ... of November but yet or to answer a question I I Do think there's enough there\nFor impeachment and if af are I Would I Would vote on\nThat sounds great go ahead do it I don't know what's gonna happen I couldn't tell you what's going to happen or if they win back\nI Know that there's going to be tons of investigations that are going to try to get his taxes they're going to do a lot of different things and what you're going to find is\nAnd and the way that our politics to set up is you know we're supposed to fight right we're supposed to look for is you know\nI I talked about what Thomas old before the great thing that he said there's there's no solutions there's only tradeoffs that's proven solution is you know two plus two is four that your solution is a solution to that problem but the trade offs or it's the give and take\nWe talk about right you're not going to get a hundred percent I'm not going to get a hundred percent\nBut the squeaky wheels demand a hundred percent or nothing they don't care about the other eighty percent that wants some sort of trade off to move something forward\n\nIt's sad it's sad that we're in this situation he was asked because he he went into the lion Ted thing the other night in their debate he was asked about calling a as I call theater theater cruise alliance head\nAnd you called Sen Cruz lions head\nWhy did you say that fear I went through a whole debate at SMU with Senator Cruz where he made up\nOne story after another and so I decided that he has been the rest of the debate responding to\nEvery single dishonest things that he said or I could uh make sure that everyone understood exactly what he's doing is not something that I feel totally comfortable with and perhaps in in the heat of the moment um I took a step too far and read it I don't know that that's that's the way that I Want to be talking in in this campaign\nYeah I I you know I found him to be very very interesting ah he wants to do a lot of things that cost a lot of money and he's already talked about raising taxes the one thing where he differs I think from some of the other Democrats is they want to take everything back to where it was like look\nWe don't need to raise the\nTaxes back to thirty five percent or these ... we can go from Twenty one percent or twenty three twenty four twenty five pay for some of these things I'm willing to listen to some of this 'cause I think some of this stuff and I think there's a better way that we could have gone about doing taxes which frustrated the hell out of me\nA with a lot of stuff that the way that they they jammed through taxes and and the brakes and they're you know [noise]\nIt is frustrating but he had some interesting things but he also talked about the expense of it and you know there's a lot of stuff he wants to do whether it's early childhood education\nTo paying for a two year degree and junior college or or some of these things you know and I'm for investing in education and I think there's a way we can invest in education I got no problem with that because I think that there were turned on her money is fantastic\nIn saying that when you want to spend\nThe return on our money is fantastic\nIn saying that when you walk to spend so much money there's only so much\nMoney to go round every time that you talked to a Democrat if they want to add a new program at some point in time you're like look if you if you raise tax rates at one percent here one percent one percent because you've got a new problem next thing you know you look up and that's when taxes rather control\nIt becomes the spending side of three two three five three twenty four twenty three actually had been to show is your Twitter you can tweet us okay so that's the trap and Van Jones are all over Pat Robertson\nAnd I listen to this about ten times this is Pat Robertson says so you know he is you know or was it to see the end 'cause you broadcast networks all you know is it ... evangelical talking about\nThe the murder of a democracy Yogi and the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United states\nGives them a hundred billion dollars worth of arms sales which is you know that's one of those things but more than that we've got to have some Arab allies we've had so many people were killed I mean we had the uh eight people were killed in Lebanon the people who have been taken hostage ... over the years I\nKnow is bad but I mean we've had all kinds of stuff but you know blow up an international last oh one portion I mean I'm Sorry\nOkay so he said you got a hundred billion dollars it is what it is but the alliance [laughter] this is how they take it on CNN\nFounded on the media was saying is that money is more important president from has made the same kind of statements\nGrotesquely calculating the cost of human life in this case it's a hundred and ten billion dollars that is a grotesque calculation to make a I Will point out this administration is not the first to make it it's the first really to make it openly\nAnd honestly and as sort of make a plea as time passed\nSo let's see here what he said again let's go over that so yes it's about money\nWrite them a hundred billion though who was alarm sales which is you know that's one of those things but more than that we've got to have some Arab allies\nBut more than that but more than that Ben Jones\nAs a person that they myself on and we and we share the that's not our minister should be talking about this um that literally the reverse of the golf balls and the teachings of Jesus Christ to put literally material a conflict with considerations over the dignity of a human soul is against Christianity\nSo disingenuous it's not even close to that he said allies\nOver and over again he said it is what it is the money is what it is and I'm no fan of Pat Robertson at all but if you stop being disingenuous he didn't say it's the most important thing he's the most important thing is what having allies\nOr as a joke or Christians have particular um whatever disagreements I might have with them and policy all on principle I used to be able to line up with him on principle you know personal morality matters these things matter when you will fall for it but at least on at the level of principle we could agree now is in\nYou know what we get a good Supreme Court some tax cuts and to deal with the Saudis screw all that stuff kill people we don't care about are the N. word stars I don't matter ... adultery doesn't matter porn stars don't matter killing people doesn't matter hey we got a business run here\nThat's not a person of ... no oh no let's not when you put it but but again this had enough that this was\nAll about being able attack pat Robin ... easy to do in the left and again I'm no fan of Pat Robertson at the same time you're being disingenuous talking about allies right talking about Alex\nFan of Pat Robertson at the same time you're being disingenuous talking about allies right talking about allies trust me we can get a hundred and ten billion dollars out of several other countries would love to buy weapons from us\nBut are they going to have the same kind of home to fend off Iran\nThat the stuff that drives people crazy 'cause you're not being genuine they're your

feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nYou know are there is a right way and a wrong way to do just about everything and there is a great way to come to this country and there is a long way and they are going about is a long way if they want to seek political asylum there is a process for doing that and we know\nThat it is important that we defend our southern border and when you talk to all of our border patrol agent they talk about the necessity\nOf doing that and I think it's in theory is that we\nMake certain our border is secure I encourage Mexico can make certain that they're border is secure and that they're protecting their sovereignty book cause\nThis is not something that you know people injuring by force is not something that we should\nView as being unacceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nTo opponents who's very steep to this um you know take no prisoners very ... way of looking at the world people were very good at it and I just tell people that's which was I'm an actor guy\nYou've got other choice [noise] um if you want to move things forward makes compromise is try to get some solutions for immigration healthcare and all these big issues of events with one of them would be real pleased represent people trying to say one more time\nOh here's the had eight years of Obama what did they did they must have our healthcare system and we did catch and release so what is he talking about\nOh well you know just this this\nHealthcare system and we did catch and release yeah so what is he talking about\nWell you know this is this is going to be language that you hear from liberals when they don't want to stand on constitutional principles and we hear it over and over I have one of the most bipartisan\nRecord of accomplishment of anyone in the house and I continue to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\nFace same belief freedom hope an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's\nSovereign case and protecting our borders securing that southern border\nWasn't my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when he was governor he gave Valley State issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to sixty one thousand\nIllegal aliens he they tend to see a haven for\nIllegal aliens in our general assembly stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but this is the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater\nI fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them those certificates and I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policy I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think so ... would be somebody there at the border welcoming dental giving them\nA state issued id and of course we know the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders so\nI'd say like stand firm on this anti what to make certain that they care of and now they cannot just come walking into our country and receiving benefits Tennessee and want to see us to deal with the gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human draft traffickers and secure the border\nWell again we're getting reports from\nRural Virginia I'm this is you know rural Virginia down in South West Virginia or illegal immigrants there are again demanding services go off and getting paid in cash\nA and this undermines us a worker of all backgrounds legal immigration legal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond set up with us and how it has to stop\nA congresswoman Blackburn what ... what will you are in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and didn't do anything which I'm personally livid about this there's no reason this mobile mobs should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall [noise]\nWell you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get the Senate to take that up and it that is a good place to start and to remind people is that is and executive them a program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so for putting\nAnd uh passed into law\nSo dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so putting a that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing the southern border you know ... you realize walls work anybody doubts that don't talk to Israel walls work\nAnd what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country\nThat ought not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I met with say an angel on the other day an Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by an illegal alien who had had several\nRun ins with law enforcement\nAnd of course her daughter is she did she is rearing his grandson and that illegal alien went back to Mexico and this is not ...\nIt's it's not right and for the families they want to see justice they want to make certain that we do you verify that employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in West Tennessee I talked to a guy who has a a brick and mortar update a business and\nHe was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him his son to get work now because they're being under the bed by those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior\nRough totally and\nYeah and then he and his sons go in and do it\nRight but he said you know even in these big jobs for he and his sons to keep their ... business in in gear to keep it growing again\nAnd so these are real issues and well I Will tell you this I think when people look at the immigration issue they do see it as a security issue not having the borders secured\nEvery towns a border town every state supporter state and it's one of the fraternal order of police has endorsed to me and my race on tough on crime tough on trafficking truck on\nTough on the drug issue the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue if they see it as an issue that affects them in their community and to law enforcement personnel that are working to keep their community shame\nOn again uh we're talking to Marsha Blackburn here on a ... show we've hit\nThe issue of immigration and now the issue of the economy the Republicans are leading by a record Fifteen ... percentage points against the Democrats in this mid term cycle or that is music to my ears President Trump promised he was going to do certain things and he's done them\nIncluding on trade and all and the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade\nHe they have a ... I think they have one of the largest gaps in history also on trade meaning people are embracing what the Republicans are doing this is the new NBC Wall Street Journal\nPoll a congresswoman Blackburn\nAnd and it it's bearing fruit we're seeing the the results of sticking with this more American focus tax cuts pick on China get more manufacturing and home and it's working\nWell it is working and I'm not a fan of tariffs I like free and fair trade and in West Tennessee where I Am right now we're our farmers our sleeping farmers are incredibly concerned about what he was going\nEight and ... and west Tennessee where I Am right now or our farmers showers sleeping farmers are incredibly concerned about what he's going to end up happening with China but here's the thing China China a trade war on us for decades\nCongressman how do you expect to win the trade war with China without terrorists because if we had been able to do that we would have done that by Twenty years ago right\nThat's right and so\nWhat they will say is if we're in a war\nWe got to be sure we win this war and it brought us what they want to do and they want to make certain that the price that that is tough on China they than stealing our intellectual property take them reverse engineering is they have been taking American Jobs and our owners will say\nOh we get it but we've got to have some great leaflets they sure when this trade war and that we open up markets today are encouraged to project us in the way they are encouraged to use as structuring their agreement on the table

ten percent Jewish I had no idea\nUh because I had some some some aunts and uncles and some great aunts and uncles and and and and whatnot that were that were and but it was it's a very interesting thing and ah we I identified several people you know in the mid west it was it's kind of interesting and he goes back a long way and you can see some of these people are to you what it shows you\nYou think about this just being on planet earth the luck of the draw of the draw when they say it's one in four trillion trillion or whatever just to just to be born because to think that your great great great great\nGreat great great great great great great grandmother who had to meet you know you go through all of these things and to think about the trickle down to where you exist\nIs insane 'cause if if if grandpa when it went left instead of right he wouldn't ... grandma and that's that's the insanity\nOf when you break it down you're like whoa right\nLike that is really written that fill you refused to do this right 'cause you're not giving your DNA to anybody that's right\nNow I was watching something last week which I found you know because they caught the California uh they they got the killer right the ... and ... there was so interesting to see how they did this\nBut now they think they're narrowing down who they think maybe the zodiac killer and they think this may end up being the exact same thing ... you know that they can narrow it down you know what I found to be interesting about that whole\nThing is you know who that some people are thinking is is getting play for the zodiac killer fill Ted Kaczynski\nThe Unabomber but you're going to say and ...\nNo no no no Ted Cruz's or that that's that's that never never he's too busy right now but uh uh no that's one of the things that's been like the big thing they want to they want to petition to get his DNA and and sample because they do have some fingerprints and things like that and I think that'd be interesting\n'cause a lot of it's about the same time I was out in the woods out there those kinds of things you know he used a lot of different math formulas\nHow cool man wow\nHe's kooky right he's kooky three two three five three twenty four twenty three at she had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet us ... so what we're getting is the newest latest reports is the Turkish officials are saying that he could show ... the journalist was missing\nWas hacked up into bits and pieces and that's how he uh was taken out that he was cut up\nOh God what an awful just a horrible horrible thing and right now\n... got a serious serious thing they gotta look at and how he deals with this\nAnd the ramifications like I say are huge 'cause we're supplying a lot of arms right now and a lot of those arms are going to help prop up a government in Yemen that's going through a massive civil war that is getting uglier an ugly or with God Knows how many people have already died and the potential of millions of dying from a famine\nAnd it is a and then of course you've got a Iran and all of this stuff I I that's why he gets paid when he gets paid that's why he wants to be this and when you get into a situation like this\n[noise] [noise]\nIt is going to be a it is going to be ugly it is in whatever way he goes because if he decides\nThat he's going to stick with the path and then he's going to buy the real killers and that that's what they're saying he's getting here at home\nUh\nAnd if he decides not to the potential of what could be the first domino and several Donovan knows that that fall apart in in the middle east because it's not just us and this was the other thing that there are other things at play here including the ... when it comes to Saudi Arabia because the west across the board is looking at this\nRepresentative from the twenty eight European Union nations of met there watching events closely and they are in agreement on what they want you foreign policy chief

matters the most\nWhat we absolutely do matters the most so\nIt's interesting to see what he is going to do and how he is going to play this because I Know knowing Trump he wants to move forward with the orange deal and just chalk it up as a horrible tragedy and could have potentially going to say look here's the deal guys we know that you did something you shouldn't have done\nAnd this is ridiculous I'm gonna tell you guys this right now\nWe move ahead with this you got one chance if\nFor the sake of God you do something else\nThat brings my attention to it in a way that you couldn't even imagine we will make your life beyond a living hell\nAnd I will get everybody in the ear when everybody else to join in and it will be absolutely off do we have an understanding my red line as you know go ask Assad is much different than the old guys red line\nCould that potentially happen yet\nBut with only fourteen and a half billion dollars that whole thing being signed you gotta ask yourself the question you know you've got an out here that is isn't going to be as devastating money wise at least up front as people think so if I'm Trump though in and he also has the opportunity to

he went to Africa he's a hunter and\nTrophy hunting is usually legal but it's always highly controversial [laughter] guys\nAnd this morning that target is Idaho fish and game commissioner Blake Fisher\nHe's facing calls to resign after sharing trophy photos of a recent hunting trip to Africa and an email that he shared with more than one hundred and his friends and colleagues Fisher shares photos of himself and his wife posing with at least fourteen animals they say they killed ... last month\nYeah they were booms and ... or if you go on line and you look stuff up and you look at the data there are a nuisance and a lot of places\nIt's still tough but it's that\nFuzzy thing right is that we're in fuzzy thing because if he would've caught a tiger shark and he would have posed with it people have been like if he would've killed an alligator they show on TV would gator hunters\nRight for teeth jethro with his hat sideways and they're outside\nKilling gators and nobody seems to care but this is one of those things where people get\nHere he is Posey with a giraffe this picture with a leopard saying shut a leopard super cool super lucky but it is this photo of him smiling holding up the bodies of a family of ... including a baby right there in the front that's raising them most dire writing I shot a whole family of bad loans\nYeah and now he's resigned today a and a lot of people who are out there\nWho are who who are are game honors you know even I thought James Woods who's a conservative came out last night said this stuff is ridiculous or look for some of these things and this includes like when you go out and you see a lot of these people who hunt draft and things of that nature but a lot of times they allow you to do it because\nThis draft serves no longer a purpose and you're not going to put it in a zoo and it's big enough and strong enough that it's not letting the young males continue on the lines and continue to reproduce so in doing so you're sending the herd and it looks awful horrible but this was\nYou know you've gotta you've gotta be socially you just have to be aware you have to have some idea and hunters are not thrilled by this because it makes them all up at\n... from pro hunting group Idaho for a while like says fishers actions send the wrong state knows\nHe should've been fired immediately the governor should have ... she was doing a lot of damage\nFor hunting and he said he came out and said look I haven't done anything immoral I haven't done anything wrong I didn't break the law\nAnd we had this knee jerk reaction all the time to go after people and things is it a good look no had what his life be different if he didn't send those pictures elsewhere absolutely his life would have been different if you to kill the hundred gators or a hundred shorts nobody would have\nBut when it comes to fuzzy things you don't watch\nThe pictures parking comparisons iffy so the lion was a popular attraction for visitors that is if we can feel he was killed by an American hunter and twenty fifth team\nOh God the otherness now like\nSome ... like remember what we call scissors or they look who's the piece of the line and you do get a no idea that was right the dentist got all those death threats and all that stuff you know people need to do with al ... idea a but this guy again has as as as resigned I guess today\nA but [noise] you have\nTo understand the social implications of stuff like this and know who you're showing things to\nAsk for Fisher who he tells in Idaho newspaper he was surprised at the reaction to his tramp apologizing for sending the photos but not for hunting again I didn't do anything illegal I didn't do anything unethical I didn't do anything and moral yeah\nThat may be true but now you got no job and you are you today kind of said I I you know should have done some stuff took his wife wanted to show her stuff and hunters do these and and a lot of people were like well it's it's it's wrong that hunters pay money to go out and to take down these big game it's wrong to do stuff like this well what\nAre you able to do with these animals that's the question because is it is it better if you take the animal and you do what I'm curious\nBecause you're not going to put it in a zoo because live this life in the wild and that would be cruel you are you gonna separated and keep it by itself somewhere because you want to feel good about something or you're going to take somebody's fifty grand and some of these instances are a hundred grand allow them to hunted because if you keep more they are and a lot of ways they're not going to reproduce the way they should\n\nYou would Australia kangaroos are a pain in the ass yeah that's for sure might they're huge pain in the ass\nBut if we saw somebody kill one God 'cause fuzzy catch a tiger shark today or a bunch of crocodiles or a bunch\nOf ... is a great we're going to make a show out of\nThis like the

eight five five forty lore art Arthur will join us a lot more coming up\n\n\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule that though I had a sinus headache for a few days but I had a massive brain ... which of the brain and stroke\nAnd outs called ice and he joins us now art I'm I'm sure you're not surprised\nWhat was formerly called the ins and now it's called ice and he joins us now art I'm I'm sure you're not surprised that after we did away with the family separation policy which you know was unpleasant and the media obviously played a big role in\nGetting people are very outraged about that ah that this was going to continue and get worse and indeed we had a thirty eight percent jump in family units crossing the border in the month of August from the month before a so this is no surprise I assume deal\n[noise] no absolutely not a lawyer and actually an sort of surprised it took this long for a cure of and like this to assemble the fact is that you know we see these courts no constantly a hit up wearing the president's efforts to\nAh cut down on the number of people are coming across the border to detain individuals' that's your purpose and come to the United states is live and work in the United states and you get relief\nYou've got to let you want it and it's a it's an incentive for those individuals to her to the United states we need to cut up as Meg that's the president's attempted to do it but Congress hasn't stepped up the task and [noise] you know frankly the fault is on them\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if it wanted to to stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be\nEnforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what other a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families so that their cases could be hurt\nQuickly so that the good cases can be separated that circa ... cases will eat that night and those folks can be returned to the United states they could also uh you know change the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states and again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum a lot of well they should be applying for asylum let's hope that they're not in addition ah the ah the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where are the company daily in a minors has to be released after twenty eight days\nUm Congress can you know step in and they can end the floor as a\nSettlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they're afraid it doesn't matter if ... how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter it's a it's a it's an emotional manipulation game and they want to they want to pull the heartstrings America and put these Republicans back on their heels says okay you want to put babies in cages you want to play babies how many times that we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that in order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into the best facilities that we have available Congress can provide more money for that but\nHere's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous rapes robberies murders on the Obamas\nIt comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous rapes robberies murders under the Obama administration when they had similar ah programs we saw NPR run articles about this we saw National Geographic of all things\nAre run an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all you see a little girl in a pink shirt\nStanding next to her mother crying as border patrol agent make sure that her mother doesn't have any contraband that child traveled through the night without food how in the world any parent can subject their child but this horrendous drone United States is beyond me\nUh when you when you see these four thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nWho's paying for this I think there is no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars it costs to\nGet to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect administration to be looking into that a lot of these people bell or you know doing this because they believe that the the the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states for a very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor at this is another incentive again went back to verify that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory e verify that's the key is the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to catch that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so those are the good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum from Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are you know ever going to leave the country is not the case is that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we're talking about you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God we're in the United states under ... they've received their due process or it's not\nLike they're waiting for their their their hearing everything that they had coming to them they've had but they remain in the United states we continue to work here again we have no ... no way to verify that there are leading end eyes just lack the resources to go out and find ones and twos these are people\nPlus you you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under ... orders of removal\nYou know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the raft sheet that they're under a file order removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries but everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work\nWhen any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night art and he said that the folks in a Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter who travels with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he said well look I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and never mention anything about ... ...\nSo all he said well look I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and\nNever mention anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the cook coaching really occurs\nThat's where you get you know the paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview so the script for everybody man woman and child seems to be\nThe same and I fear for I think for my family they're going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions wants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that through a homeland\nSecurity bill I think it was attached to that bill\nYeah it but you know here's the other problem or this is the next year that's going to drop\nAbout Seventy five to ... percent of all people who claim credible fear than to have credible here even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before\nThe problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear something then\nUh they get referred over for torture convention claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a claims that at the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual is removed from the United states\nDa chess needs to give that authority back to ... or ah the Justice Department needs to give that authority back ta da chest so that they can make a determination\nWhether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical part\nWell and also a as is he or someone else made the point when someone claims domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing\nBut think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's it's well it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse well it hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate\nA local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in or a review in Texas or Arizona it's just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation of place that actually prevents the United states government investigate it whether or not that claim took place in the whole country nothing that's contained asylum application can be disclosed to anyone outside of that asylum pursuing we'll leave very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border and that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries or if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nAre you looking for a new gun

really bad acting\nAnd this is typical Hollywood though it's Hollywood is like out of ideas ... it again it's the only thing the only way you could kill a blue collar person about the lower middle class person it through opioids or drugs or something because they're all too stupid\nTo know how to get a prescription or they're you know they're just bunch of ... this is how they treat the blue

from the writing room there were tons of those throughout this episode\nAnd I I just I just think when you have a ... character that's been removed for a reason other than something to do with the show\nI it it's not helpful to kind of poke your finger in the eye of that audience and expect them to tune in next week it's not going to happen\nHow you're listening to Laurie Ingram show Rehman Roy

opposite okay so why aren't worth way to do it and take all of that power from her than putting this stigma of drug addiction on or not that I'm\nNow kicking kicking the fate any yeah kicking the fate Sharon I'm Sorry we're out of time uh\nWell it Raymond I think that is the way a lot of people think Hollywood thinks of them though a lot of middle America feels condescending look down to\nYou know they had to beat her down not only make or a drug addict but part of a drug ring in the neighborhood pathetic and out of character\nAh you're listening to your healthy radio addiction ... going to join us the blue wave or more of a trickle don't go away\n\n\nIf you suffer from E. D. and you've seen your doctor about the little blue bill you know can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle what if I told you that a certain little blue pill just came off pat\nUm is still very winnable or the Republicans was killing that they do what they need to do which is and they've been very slow out of a cabinet on hearing so I think of galvanized to even before that you could see that there were voters who are quite concerned\nWith the show what I call chaos when you when you talk to voters about the potential\nNew York talking I was one of the big three I Believe um that worries immigration you have\nYou know a large majority so huge majorities of people who oppose sanctuary cities who um [noise] uh are in favor of 'em I mean who oppose I'm\nA I'm a what's happening at the border who who are worried or you have a belief that the I'm a huge huge majorities Oregon's abolishing ice which has become kind of a overnight it democratic\nParty um doctrine I'm and I'm In and who believe I'm ... and above twenty twenty Martin and people who believe that you know Democrats are\nMore likely basically to favor of the rights of the illegal aliens\nThan they are the rights of citizens it's a theme that Trump is put on this is a big issue and it's across the board um and and um it change moves votes as does the another issue which is important because I Believe\nUm in light of the capital stop these numbers probably already been more important which is the when the argument that the Democrats if they take the house or\nProbably already been more important which is the\nWhen the argument that the Democrats if they take the house are already many of them pledge and we now have their chairman hum of there\nTo be chairman if they win this year in committee I'm sharing that are saying well we're gonna we're gonna impeach cabinet we're going to impeach Trump we always investigations are a great belief that this will disrupt the economy\nAnd I'm a sense that um this is going to be chaotic chaotic and that it is going to weaponize the constitution for the purpose of going after unpopular presence whatever they say we know that their agenda\nSome had had a couple of days later said just to recap so you know some issues that would drive Republican turnout in maybe maybe even win over some Democrats\nDr ... yes but we'll move was the number of Democrats and many independents civil move in the third big issue of course is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me ah you know the Dems as they now refer to them the Democratic impeachment mob\nI'm a party um uh\nAnd you know the repeal the promise to repeal every piece of a or reject every piece of the president's economic policies\nUm which are booming for most people are at least much more positive than they haven't been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are opting out of the middle\nOne democratic socialism but Hubbard all with the idea of chaos you know whether to bang on windows they are going to disrupt the country in a way that it for two years would be awful for the most people see\nSome of the law and order and I'm not as let's say hold on let me just again law and order safety law and order comedy the respect\nUm respect yes those are really good terms and then the answer is is that they are so far out they are now with their projections of what they want to do or what they're saying saying\nThat this really bothers voters and that is what has been we've been seeing the closing up it is imperative that seems to me that those through what I call that prior to ...\nUm the Democrats have healthcare and you're not going to take that away from ... to light 'em but um except for the fact of what the cost is because that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea of the Democratic party trying to Institute\nThey've socially the Democratic socialism of that bothers people and then the ... does\nOkay this is yeah hold on this is what Nate Silver of course the whole you know he's the he's the ... the statistical a journal and he practiced statistical journalism\nUm and he you know he didn't get the production right in twenty sixteen uh but this time he's saying\nPeople should not be that surprised by a Democratic Senate\nOr a Republican House where in dangerous territory from a productive assumption standpoint he set of four and five chance may sound like a done deal but it's simply isn't a and he said it's it just because someone thinks\nSomething is a high probability might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable\nSo when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house\nA high probability it might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable fact so when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house and no it isn't enough about it maybe it's likely historically but it's not inevitable and I think that's what a lot of Republicans have to get through their heads\nYes this is why it's still hanging 'em I leave it there must be very hard to be predicted business environment because you don't know what's going to drive\nThis thing at the end we have a the selection disturb many many things that are under law in this election most of all by the way is what like the Trump and sixteen a fear of returning the country to the hands of the political class\nA elites and the sense of of losing what progress that has been made and the that that anti\nWashington anti elitism still exist very great with the issue has been for the Republicans can nationalize the election I still don't think I still think there's more they could do they could run national advertising with these things right\nStop it and by the way it's cheaper to do and it's more effective because guess what when you buy network advertise you to be inside of the shows rather than crammed into all the local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with this these commercials\nYou get to stand on your own but they need to nationalize because then Harris lay off year elections are\nAre off year elections are um tend to be for people who are in the party that the the unhappy the disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade tweets either but when you put the big issues in front of people are consequences\nThen something happens and I think the Republican doing and all the candidates are doing a better job of frankly the patch and all those they have not gotten together to do what they could do 'em too of mashed going further national\n... and now we have not and not just the local X amount is\nIs it a national election and people need to understand the choices because their concerns are very great again Kavanaugh hearings beginning of the Supreme Court the driving people out of restaurants\nThis instability arguments retribution and had some numbers yesterday that showed overwhelming rejection of the Hillary Clinton proposition all even split among Democrats\nOr whether or not you know this notion that you can't be civil to you when I'm there is and the things of that and they believe by the way by a large a priority that if the Democrats win civility will get worse\nThings will become worse than they are now\nI Want to play a Nancy Pelosi for you or this is below sea on discussing Trump's desire for a long especially given what we're seeing these new migrants listen\n\n\nManhood issue and and that ties into what an a list be the last question they still have the year the woman you have a lot of these interesting women running for office a lot of them former veterans\nAnd some of them doing really well so they are the woman you're the one it could also be the year the man\nAh because well our thing with a man and masculinity being attacked in the cabin on at all\nCould also be the year of the man\nOf because well are seeing with men and masculinity being attacked in the cabin on it at all\nYeah so I think there was a backlash I think that there is certainly a gender gap but it goes both ways and the men uh and and again I come back to it's not just running up the Republican base there are huge numbers of independents remember to carry\nIn twenty sixteen and a large share of Democrats who are not happy with the way things these the the prospects are going and it is and it really that those voters as well as the base\nBe exposed to the larger consequences of what happens if you will while the Democrats to take over and what will happen to them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "17", "locations": [["Gibson", 35.99661, -88.93262], ["Pima County", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["Saudi

his slaves and you think to yourself how could a man so bright\nJustify behavior so wrong and we can't but it doesn't mean he didn't read the declaration of independence it doesn't mean he was in a a third person the United states it doesn't mean\nThat he didn't author of Jeannie constitution so at the University of Virginia and was the brain trust behind some of the greatest things of the first major democracy in my in the modern world ... many more give people the idea that it's not whether we're you were born you have an opportunity to be successful that was not the case before America came\nAlong so he did all those great things but I still will never and you will ever justify slavery but I still think I could say he's a person of his time\nYeah and we can't get past that because we want to go whether it's a ... you do today and then a year from now we decide that's offensive or something we look back on our history decided it's offensive it's this retro rage that drives me crazy talking to brag embodied Andrew gender Jackson and the miracle of New Orleans it down on paper backwards it come on October\n... comes out on a comes out next week and what I'm doing on the Nineteen twenty twenty first America great from the start of your lives show is on the stage talking about are talking about these three Americans doors that wrote about as well as the two sports books I did it give people a chance to talk about what's happening in politics more of a theater setting\nSo we go to Brian kill me dot com you can get tickets will be in Tampa Virginia Beach as well as in I'll finish up in Nashville so they asked\nWhat is it that when you go on stage like this are we going to these places obviously or for Fox so you kind of have that you know oh here comes this crazy conservative guy and and and we're seeing more and more where people are coming up and and getting in people's faces but then you write something like this and\nAnd and you know we're hearing about you know the likes of Jordan Peterson and many other people going on campuses and and\nAnd disrupting when you go out there you feeling that kind of push back are you going to people that are challenging you with you know whether it be this you're writing about Andrew Jackson he's a horrible human being because he was a slave owner are you getting any of that\nYeah sure in fact uh CSPAN televised went to some book festival the day of John McCain's funeral this was still packed and I'm In DC and I'm going in front of a maybe\nFifteen hundred people and they said to me a favor safety questions at the end I a lot more to say but I said well you know the the promoters want some questions first question grade second question great the third question\nHe hates everything about may\nHave everything I've done\nProbably hates my family and I'm sitting there on stage and when it does it makes everybody feel awkward instead of having a probing questions they talk about wow how bad boxes how Thomas Jefferson wasn't really taking on Islamic extremists\nA meal Jackson did a lot of bad things to American indian so it's not like they want an avid dialogue is\nI'm In Washington DC were eighty five percent of the people did not vote for Donald Trump or George Bush and you just have an agenda and they can't believe the American people or me don't agree with them so it's not even interesting to talk to wake you up to one Williams\nYou talked to Geraldo Rivera you talk to die to Brazil did it's called the conversation\nBut yeah people are so angry now they're not conversations\nNobody's interested in conversation and people are looking for their thirty seconds to sound bite of fame that they're going to get on the Internet but the reality\nThe conversations\nNo nobody's interested in a conversation and people are looking for their thirty seconds to sound bite of fame that they're going to get on the Internet but the reality is they they don't want to have a conversation because you may come back with something they can answer so they want no part of that they just want to be able to throw the first punch and then run away and that drives me crazy about today's world\nBecause we're not having conversations Brian I like having a ... I had a dream or on the other day we did a podcast forty five minutes of dreamer was a great conversation we had a conversation about everything from sports to what he what it's like to feel like an American and have troubles here to his wife and his kids and all of these things\nAnd it was a real conversation we did we differed interviewer areas and we agreed in some but we never get to that point anymore because all we want to do was yell at each other\nI think that to look them I going to defend President Trump's riding a horse face for Stormy Daniels absolutely not I Am I going to defend a you know calling people out you know call me Rosie O'Donnell animal\nNow I Am I you know if there are some things are indefensible that President Trump does I'm not going to you but in the big picture I don't look at it get up every day and thinking how he's destroying the country\nIf you look at these numbers you see the economy increasing you see her defense getting stronger you see our trade deals getting better if you want to argue with me at least think knowledge what's happening and then challenge me and I'm not going to push back when you say there's a need to tweet personal attack\nAbsolutely not is beneath the office for me yes\nBut it can I tell you that his approach is America First in every way he's lost over a billion dollars this is by conservative estimates by taking this job\nHis company can invest internationally his son is being skewered his lawyer is being Jews ... matter of time has got to be jailed his CFO is forced to take immunity\nIs best friends office has been raided and now he's got to get immunity one of the ... who owns the Enquirer think about what he deals with an a daily basis they the Trump name is lauded and hated it used to be pretty much respected so why did he do it\nAt least acknowledge he's doing it for the country at least acknowledge that trade deal is that we can build another\nBuilding in Mexico and Canada at least acknowledge that he's trying to get a better deal for America he takes on the ... you not for his ego because he feels as though the trade deals are tilted against us and NATO wasn't paying enough he's not running from allies why can't you take a step back and say he's different\nBut let's see if he's wrong I Want to say let's see if this works\nNow I don't think people understand that because they look at everything is so emotional they and they decided to let their feelings or you know handle everything in their life and I to me I find that\nCrazy we're talking to Brian humane Andrew Jackson and the miracle of New Orleans sent out in paperback next week or you know do you think Andrew Jackson would've treated I think I think a lot of these guys would have gone on there and it was just totally been in trouble like ... like Trump\nJackson is a good point when you your regional question I did not do a good job of answering as how are they like they're like this they both were despised by the elite or the predecessor John Quincy Adams bronco bomber they both are not accepted as presidents or the John Quincy Adams left the White House before\nBefore uh before the before Andrew Jackson did even get into the White House causing a deer riot with a lack of security\nSo you as somebody who not like the case of the people Jackson was the first to campaign when Trump was not accepted by the Republican Party or a the Washington establishment he brought his case in middle America and guess where he want middle America he was a not worthy of the office\nOr or the Washington establishment he brought his case in middle America and guess where he wanted\nMiddle America he was a not worthy of the office they looked at Jackson going so poor that backwards or the Carolinas he used to draw in crew to be president he's from he's that Jefferson Monroe he's now Washington you know he's not Adam this guy's got no sophistication at all\nYou know he's a military general that you know he's good at that but not this meanwhile\nHe is the American success story he is the guy that was offered to Thirteen to volunteer for the revolutionary war that lost his two brothers during that war and his mom and his dad before he was born who was raised by the town that county the country who blood red white and blue and live to get\nRevenge other people that destroyed his family and that's the British that to American success story viewers policies one way but understand what he represented if you come to this country you could accomplish anything you want or at least have the opportunity to fail that's were not represented\nAbsolutely and last question appreciate your coming on today or\nYou look at this whole thing going on with a\nCause showy and everything that is happening and the way that Trump is looking at it and you know one of my things on the talk about or you know as I've been talking about throughout the day is the fact that you know Trump looks at this in a much more you know a macro way than you think we need Saudi Arabia as much as we don't like that and in some ways I'm trying to explain to somebody they\nYou know sometimes

forty Laura [noise]\nHere's an unprecedented number of unfilled opportunities so obviously you need laborers they're going to come from somewhere and as we all know immigrant employing about Americans coming back into the workforce how 'bout that would be how about how Americans and as we're coming back in the workforce which are doing like\nRandom they were going to run out of the openings but let

Obama are coming out of that you know horrible recession we've got all the stimulus son of stimulus ought to be [noise] I'm just I'm just wondering like we're we're we're the deficit hawks\nDuring the eight years of Obama you're listening to your healthy radio addiction eight five five forty Laura how many of you believe that this issue of these ... these huge caravans of people storming the border what's politically time they see the Democrats think this is a good issue for them\nI think they made a ... steak horrendous mistake it's a terrible issue for them the Republicans must stand with the president eight five five forty Laura let's go to Jerry in Pennsylvania on line for chair\nCouldn't\nSpeak up I don't know why are you guys are on bad phones are bad I don't know what it is but you all have to speak up because we all want to hear you so if you're on a speaker phone you can\nLike I said I couldn't I couldn't I handed over to more the Democrats are staging the so to say that mothers and they deserve and but the but I Want to add one thing if they are with you I think the uh we don't need immigrant ...\nWhat we need are unemployed\nI think you\nHit the nail on the head we need people to develop skills in this country the trades how many times you read articles that that we don't have enough tradesmen and ... and what can you say tradesmen any more people who do trades [laughter]\nWe don't have enough of of skilled uh labor's hand on hands on labor as we need that and that's where people from all walks of life all walks of life can learn a skill in your you can learn a skill after you've left your your current career\nAnd work I'm not talking about being up on a roof and roofing that's more of a young person's job but you know what I'm Talking about the idea that America has to import uh foreign workers to do every\nAmerican job is lunacy I when I grew up we didn't need that probably didn't have that problem when I when I was growing up Americans did all sorts of jobs from picking a tobacco which my brother did to picking fruit which I did\nWho I mean all of us did all of this work in yeah if you have to pay more to get Americans to do these jobs good you should pay more and I told you when I was in Switzerland it was really interesting to talk to the Swiss about a Swiss jobs they don't do this big importation of laborers in Switzerland they don't do it\nThey didn't actually people who do everything from sweeping the streets to caring for children they get paid for doing that work eight five five forty or let's go to Evie in Florida heavy\n[noise] [noise]\nHi Laura I again I think you're on on this than an American state situation as far as the border but at the you know an American citizens here I I don't want to just think that this voting is going to help what more can we do\nWell the border the border has to be enforced the president's right if these other countries won't enforce their borders we need to put a we need to put some thought into how we are going to better do it here and he's got to ... and if it's a national emergency the president has extraordinary powers\nAnd drugs guns or criminal element of gangs we've already caught them trying to get into the country and we've already arrested people who are within the so called migrant population\nWho are only coming into the United states to hook up again contacts we brought you story after story about that\nAnd this president understands that they this president gets this like no one else how many have you saw the frightening frightening display last night on the ... it was called meet the chairman you remember that movie made the parents\nSo it was called meet the chairman and I went through chapter and verse what would happen to various committees and the house of representatives\nOr if Republicans lose control of the house and let me tell you something forget the new Jamie Lee Curtis rendition of Halloween the movie the most frightening thing you can imagine is what's\nGoing to happen to the financial services committee the house ways and Means Committee the Appropriations Committee the intel committee the energy committee\nIf the Democrats have their way eight five five forty Laura let's go to Eric in Michigan Eric go ahead\nI Believe that the easiest and quick solution to the border problem would be to open the home studying act to all of the federal I Am for rounding border and as you can make a structure dwelling a part of\nUh being able to get into the home studying act you could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever\nThe home studying act you could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever\nAnd with the uh that are already having a priority on any old studying at the opening up you could wind up with a lot of our vets in the whole study which would be helping all the American and at the same time\nPut one hell of a wall down there\nA than other interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman but Democrats just want an open border open borders open markets don't go out\n\n\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't have my ... I was getting so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and compacted trinity\nThat's our way and you I Can't even blame illegal immigrants I mean I Can't even blame them because we did this to ourselves or other countries don't do this we we did this to ourselves but now it's got to stop joining us now Michael ... of course former Trump campaign advisor\nRepublican political strategist he's involved in some of the key races\nIn New York he also has a great a podcast called still standing radio dot com to just go there are still standing radio dot com\nAnd you can listen to Michael who has a finger on the pulse of what's happening in this mid term cycle Michael it's great to talk to you I think the Democrats made a huge miscalculation and embracing these caravans of people who want to storm the border I think most people from all walks of life life across this country fine now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that Chris ... a prime time last night Steve Cortez as a warrior ... for the president he really is you know he's he's a Latino and his president or his parents\nCame here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I looked Steve as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of them death threats I'm certain schemes gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and you're on the uh the ... the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and that and they see that the economy has improved so much under the president's leadership and then on the other side they see\nChaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism or an embrace of illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nThere weren't any now with bacteria in coming towards the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met in Washington back during the Reagan years\nAnd you know I worked for Jack Kemp and it\nWas people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country\nAnd and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump and have backbone and would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd you saw what happened when the president just said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve\nAnd confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and senators we didn't even think Adam anymore and Lindsey Graham was the hero\nOf German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates from the strength and the White House\nAnd the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised parts of the word and they tried to come\nWhen he came down the stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that over and over and over again and they're still doing it today but it's not working because the average man and woman working\nEvery day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health the radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done in the last few years on immigration are shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people a year it's a lot\nOr or to be decrease so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain the same that the Gallup poll from June I'm thirty seven percent want the level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration\nTwenty nine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration\nAnd that those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration doesn't affecting your life your kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nOr in a given a school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrants for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent\nLess so ... you know people don't want this\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's very blue collar area and ah in recent year a year or so we've seen\nYou know truckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested or the seven eleven\nOn their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants\nIn and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them cash on he just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crack down needs to continue because I'll tell ya in\nWestern New York and buffalo where we used to be a strong steelworkers town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump but\nMen and women here me these jobs need these jobs and and the they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about\nAnd the Democrats in the mainstream media spend their time trying to gas light them on this issue talking about how important\nAre ... immigration to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're conflate against illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration\nIs against illegal immigration and and I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process the first the immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if it got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it\nYou know and the problem she sees is it the surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here\nIllegally some of them are now over ... visas etcetera\nAnd since it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly\n... if you can't even blame you can't blame the ...\n... says etcetera\nAnd since it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly ... if you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely\nRight a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people\nOrderly process of immigration is what we need but look the chaos at the at the border is is not dissimilar a Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... in the aftermath of Kavanaugh are and the Democrats prefer that because if there's chaos you need more government\nGovernment grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh\nThe screaming in the hearings the uh the people running down the uh the always the basement of the United states Capitol screaming at senators the the people trapping senators\nIn an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras the mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed that people trying to literally ... their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building\nIf they like that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans would lose the house\nBecause a lot of people who were not measured well by the polls and twenty six team they call is deplorable is right that people who hadn't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all\nThey found a champion and Donald Trump someone they fought\nA non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks to tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a a skip the ... the birthday party after work to go vote\nOn it and and this time around

X. ray whenever you need done happens right there it's threatened family dentistry in a comfortable\nWe have the greatest economy we've ever had\nEvery race back [noise] so it's much easier for me to do this and it was when I was campaigning when I said this will happen this is a much easier situation\n[noise]\nEight five five forty Laura we're going to bring your attention to critical races across the country one of them is Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where Marty no Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a\nCharlie Dent a thank God he's being replaced and\nMarty is in a tight race against Democrat left the Susan Wild and this has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty as a person you all have to get out and vote\nFor in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also is an avid cyclist within the two thousand uh Olympics as attract cyclists does a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration\nTrade all the rest of Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nLower first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every corner this district which is now a new district Pennsylvania seventh district has everything from the urban corps of Allentown Beth I'm an east into the\nCause of farming communities in the northern tier work district what we call this late dealt a region now what what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they were happy with what our president's been able to accomplish\nWe're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know as a rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now\nA lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake if they flip the house on a course in in Congress\n[noise] what what uh when when you see the redistricting that well obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add a urban voters to what a traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district\nIt makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to try to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration where we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth\nPeople don't like the chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\nI think that's really on a lot of people's minds was just the radical a resistance we're seeing from the last\nUh the rush of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen\nUm most people I'm Talking to I'm to the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform uh we need to secure our southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was in support of that\nI'm so immigration up here in Lee high valued customers seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty's Susan Wild is they they they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman\nOr because of the me too movement the women's march and so forth are so ... what would\nThey tried to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district so that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is\nTry to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nSo that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary or somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move to the center but a\nResult speak for themselves or you know she she's she's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy in Iraq or see\nYou know for impeaching the president teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she won't say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's where she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth that's been made possible by this president's focus uniquely on the American\nWorker the American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI I've been watching some of your a campaign or commercials in advance on line\nAnd the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks\nAnd smashing car windows and in a in raising the flags of other countries and America they want America to be a a safe prosperous nation where security\nIs paramount in our our virtuous freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I\nI think it's jobs not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side it's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that\nThe results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up and mobs uh we uh we announced a campaign uh our our\nBrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this was the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in the seventh district which\nIn my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side as it is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd funded funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth ... or ... I Can't wait to see you in Congress\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity dead management\nMy story began with that and a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIt's already happening federal services to illegal immigrants soaring across the United states\nBecause of corrupt judges court cases creating writes in the constitution and creating rights to this er rights that birthright citizenship\nAll of it it's a it has fundamentally already transformed entire states in the country or the commonwealth of Virginia this was a conservative blue collar military a lot of veterans and now if if I were Comstock\nLoses in Fairfax County Virginia and she's behind them is a congressional race reelection\nIf she loses I saw some on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies follow always liberal policies always follow wear a mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the\nAh African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll well tell us that immigration has adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has I'll give you that a stat and just a moment a doctor my Christian is with us or he is the director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni\nWho converted from Islam to Christianity and he's been following the media and their use the manipulation of this story from turkey wearing a Saturday counseling a Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post a is a was murdered\nWearing a Saturday council that Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post\nOr is or was murdered and apparently it's not Donald Trump falls Dr Christian good to have you with us out what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're you know it just affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nCigarettes for having me editor for the ship the local tendency in and you're right when you have a party that is run by by them and uh uh you know those old ah guards that it looks like they are often from inside\nWhen I I think actually this um you know story about a ... a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we're not going to get the truth out there and the reason of that has this when you know many people actually don't understand you know ... between the United states and Saudi Arabia\nAnd try to a point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and uh that that'd be killed and and also to dictators and so forth which is far from too if you listen to Trump in his last quarter on his before this incident broke out\nEmbarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and that was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East\nSo uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nI'm backing up the Saudis because he loves the loves the dictates of his old for personal gain because this is nonsense [noise] he's doing this because the Saudi Government the current government is doing a good work that helps that are not states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from biting and Obama and all of those previous president without states and why I'm saying that because you and you look at what the current um gum prince and the south the government is doing their heads making many fronts the number one is\nThey are helping by defending the Islamic movement by looking in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all\nThe fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries they are helping the states um when they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east you're helping big time they get on a the Iranian sanctions are and how Trump is putting those on\nBy living oil prices and and on all the stuff also the current administration will kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty\nThat never ever be imagined before and Donald Trump is about to announce that are very very soon what is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's an Egypt and Israel which is going to be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years so Donald Trump is supporting um you know the government\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those reasons unknown and all of those\nHead for the United states not that dictatorship and so forth plus adding to all of this we believe in this country that everybody is innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as when we have to\nFollow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know I I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the states but still ... over there and my ... in my home brew which\nYou know nothing happens by coincidence when uh the president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time after the Trump Administration\nThe president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time\nAfter the Trump Administration embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the the faster and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nExcellent point well I think again mark ... America in ... in the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the ... which again it's it's the it's so sad and it's so predictable\nThey always go to racism they always go to a phobia they this is all they have it's it's women are oppressed in the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ...\nI mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about but meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people who are about to cross into America unless we do something about the thousands and thousands of people many of them this is an adult men or\nYoung military age men who are have joined this caravan in or being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally\nThat is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and it's outrageous and Americans have to stand against its total lawlessness a\nDie hard to imagine what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas\nWhich is why the oil is go to this year's men and all the kinds of ideas that they talk about that means ... but when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democrats but go for Donald Trump\nAnd an historic on way and then right after that they start talking about the current events\nMarching to the board that of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to divide and to try to uh make the Hispanic votes jump into the vote a boost and try to vote for them so this is a very well organized a by the media and I\nHave no idea how they do it but I have no doubt that everything has it been eyes you pay attention to the states they talk about it for three days how the Hispanics voting for Trump in a historical way and then all of a sudden\nWe have an ... you know a problem on the on the border and then we have to figure this out and Donald Trump's days we're not going to let that happen\nAnd I think Hispanic votes water in Americans can see through this\nBecause I trust that when you come to this nation and you believe in that and we understand that they'll put you to you that you have you're not going to be received by the uh the bidding filthy or works of the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian um you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nWhere we have to make alliances with people in in in countries that now you know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that and don't keep your eye on the ball\nYou know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American uh people sometimes we have to do that and don't keep your eye and the ball people because what marks that is exactly right this is calculated and and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA document Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this is a calculated strategy\nGet Donald Trump out there on this immigration issue and think that because he talks about it Hispanic voters will start turning out on moss against him and the Republican Party eight five five forty Laura Laura Ingraham show [noise]\n\nAttention you could be paying too much for your health insurance new two
