morning news with my crap Tucson news and talk [noise]\nSome mornings corresponding Veronica hosted joined this morning with all its on flu season is underway\nYeah so flu season is underway only a couple of weeks here in the county it's interesting because I think we always say oh we have an idea of flu season starts to stay in it in this day but I spoke to someone at the Pima County health department who says that's actually not the case so she says that\nFlu season there's never really start date or an end date and the way they measure it is simply by looking at those numbers whenever they start climbing as in the number of flu cases you're not when they say OK flu season is underway\nI'm right now in the county it's sporadic meaning there's only been a few cases here in their state wide there's only been fifty six reported cases of the flu since the start of the season\nSo it's not fully fully a it's high peak right now on she still recommends that this is the perfect time to go get your flu shot if that's something that you want to do a and they simply recommend getting a flu shot any time in October is a good way to kind of prevent yourself from getting the feeling of course other ways that washing your hands\nCoughing in your elbow sneezing away ... away from her face yeah don't go to work if you're sick\nHe's a washing your hands coughing in your elbow sneezing away ... away from her face yeah don't go to work if you're sick\nSure well they say anything about the characteristics the flu or or how severe it is or is just a it's just the flu\nThat's another really interesting thing so I asked her about\nUm I had seen things that people say you know it's protected to be a bad flu season she says that there is no way that they can protect that so\nThey cannot say that they think the season's going to be relatively bad they don't see that until the season's over that's when they say it was about the that there is really no way for them to measure how bad or how good the seat is going to be\nSounds like the monsoon and the flu season like common\nOr at least in terms of predictability house characterized alright so uh the bottom line is just a get out there and get their flu shot and um it's particularly important for people who have\nI'm compromised immune systems and old people and all babies and stuff like that then yeah you know what they're capable of taking the shot and they certainly should alright rocket costs are joining us on two sons morning news banks thank you\n[noise]\nTo down for to go to the construction of why grant

if he were with the caravan where Fox News discovered they wanted attempted murder over the weekend just by the way now we'll get to that in a little bit\nThen the news media certainly would throw in

ridiculous it it's just a completely absurd\nFall for it and the news media is peddling that this morning and there are peddling that yesterday\nAnd ... and then as they do this they decry the

people are not really hear things let's go to the let's go to the telephones let's go to Nick in Silver Spring Maryland Nick you're on the ... plant\nShow [noise] I crossed I'm great thank you good so\nI might you ask when I was worried about the mid term elections I'm worried about the structure of the middle class in America and the fact that\nIt seemed like neither party has any sense of how to rebuild it\nUm but I also want to just point out that I I'm an independent I'm a patriot mhm but I got to tell you when it comes to divisiveness I tune into your show every so often and stuff that you stay\nIf some of the most divisive stuff that I ever hear for example I think that at some point you got to take it on the chin mhm and take some responsibility or the way you talk to\nUh-huh well I think I Do take responsibility for the way I talk and I think I open up the lines to people like yourself who uh\nWho offer suggestions like that one and uh I think that if you listen or cross the media universe you'll find a great deal of combat going on now I don't show up when I say this all the time\nI don't show up to a fight against CNN and the Washington Post the New York times and the rest of them with a a butter knife and my hand with a spoon\nI show up to go toe to toe with them and we're the little guys in this fight may make no mistake about it and that can I think you'd probably even acknowledge that\nAnd when I show up first of all I Do a very entertaining show we take on the issues of the day and what I Do is not what CNN does or not what MSNBC does at least it's not what they're supposed to do having worked at CNN for very long time myself\nYou know most Nazis didn't actually killed Jews themselves but but nevertheless\nAh the the the absurdity and the irony of all of this that that Nick was just peddling that I'm too aggressive and that really the problem is talk radio Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing or a hundred and sixty eight innocent people were murdered\nA Bill Clinton you may remember tried to blame Rush Limbaugh and conservative talk radio\nBecause it's always somebody else's rhetoric but it's never their own rhetoric it's never you're the enemy of the people that's never Brock Obama's saying yet and yet in their faces it's it's a never Hillary Clinton and the entire Democratic Party and that means the news media to\nPainting every Republican as a racist or homophobic massaging us you know the party of the clan the party that exterminate forty percent of the black population in the womb the party of Bill Clinton you want to talk of racism and sexism\nAh let's talk Jefferson Davis and Nathan Bedford Forrest and your boys or of all four of us and George Wallace and Lester Maddox send and Bull Connor you know Democrats you want to talk of anti Semitism let's talk Brock Obama with his pal the minister Louis Farrakhan let's talk about Iraq Obama rip his pal\nOr the Reverend Jeremiah Wright who famously was asked during Brock Obama's first year and the White House whether he was going to be meeting with President Obama and Brock Obama's personal spiritual guide posed for Twenty years\nThe man that presided over his wedding baptized as children bless the property that he bought with a convicted felon Tony Rezko who shortly thereafter went to a penitentiary for his Democratic party corruption\nThe minister the Reverend Jeremiah Wright of the trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago said\nYou know the Jews aren't going to let ... talk\nStir the Reverend Jeremiah Wright of the trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago said you know the Jews aren't going to ... talk to me\nWhat it was really\nExcuse me you know them Jews ain't gonna let him talk to me just to turn it into a moral lyrical sort of thing\nAnd and and then we've got Dan Rather I looked it up he's eighty six years old Dan Rather God Bless him\nHe's eighty six years old and he's going after President Trump before the ... the the smoke cleared on Saturday the Senate got\nNot only after President Trump but going after every one that all who excuse of bats or stand in silence\nWhile hate is still for political gain do you have James Hodgkinson on tap perhaps because James Hodgkinson was a big fan of the Southern Poverty Law Center and MSNBC and Rachel Maddow and Bernie Sanders is a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nSomeone most of the ah the hated him but interestingly enough the news media did go on a day is lost high rate about the about the rhetoric of the Democratic party creating a dangerous situation for members of Congress\nAnd the Southern Poverty Law Center which is America's number one have also demonize\nThe family Research Council in Washington DC a left wing terrorist showed up there with a gun and bags full of chick fillet sandwich just\nShot one man the man was a good strong man and beat the hell out of the little left wing I'm a would be mass murderer now I mean you guys want to pretend you want to play games of make believe and this is what Nick has really upset about I think\nYou guys want to play these games or make believe we're only certain facts are introduced where we're only certain arguments are allowed to be made where counter points are are shouted down and\nAh and yelled over and and I play those all the time on CNN so you know Nick ... listen if you're actually an intelligent on a serious person you're going to come around to my way of thinking\nBecause these people are lying all the time and I'm not and there is a very very important difference there an important difference is that I'm not out here lying to you every day I'm reading facts that are inconvenient to the left wing cause of the Democratic party cause and to the news media but I repeat myself\nAh but ... you know once again Nick you have no sense of irony I think\nI'm really not the problem here uh nobody uh you know Rachel Maddow had one of her fans show up at a baseball field and start blasting members of Congress or I don't I don't have that problem the Southern Poverty Law Center\nHas launched at least two fanatics wonder the family Research Council and the second you know they\nDemonized Congressman Steve Scalise speaking of which did you see the lefty over the weekend attack Congressman Steve skull lease because Congressman Steve skill lease\nSet out a tweet about how awful the Pittsburgh tragedy is was\nAnd a lefty from Fox this is he's a he's a journalist or don't you know and ah he was out there in a heartbeat attacking Steve skull lease\nCalling him what was it David Duke he called him David Duke without the the baggage David Duke without the baggage this uh this journalists from Fox and that's considered to be our mainstream news media they attack a guy who was shot nearly to death\nBy a left wing fanatic because he expressed his condolences for the people murdered and for the family members and as a party this anti\nExpressed his condolences for the people murdered in for the family members and as a party this anti Israel party which is the Democratic party\nThis anti Netanyahu anti Israel ... sixty seven borders the party of Jeremiah Wright you know the Jews won't let Brock meet with me\nThe party of the minister Louis Farrakhan I don't think those are a bunch of Trump voters in that room when Louis against the anti Semitism going a so smell yourself Nick and your media allies\nAs well let's go to um let's go to Edward in Virginia Edward you're on the cruise plant show\nA morning person running on what I you know I'm just before I get to my point Chris real quick I was born in fifty five years ago and\nThree months after I was born John Kennedy was assassinated and I've listened to news realist about that time about what CBS News was reporting and Dan Rather happened to be recording from Texas at that time\nThere was a local news reporter in Dallas right\nAnd when the before was even known what happened to John Kennedy\nThere was reports coming up from Texas that Walter Cronkite was reporting on is that there is a right wing groups upset with Adelaide Stevenson who are confronting him and that they were worried about\nJohn F. Kennedy and so they ... the thing that the ... the fact that this type of thing where you start a you know a blaming Republicans automatically is nothing new coast even before rush\nLimbaugh you know in Oakland in the Oklahoma City bombing a ha ha ha so I\nI mean they were even hinting at it than I I could just read it I just listening to it and I can tell ya I can tell where they're going with this you know so uh\nYou know let me let me pause you there for a second if I could Europe 'cause I'm I'm smiling here a little bit you were watching Nineteen sixty three newsreel footage of CBS News on what I was there not because I Want to find this was it on YouTube or something\nExactly you find it on YouTube you find the whole thing\nAnd on the day of the day after they were winning the finger at ah at right wing groups sue ah [laughter]\nI mean if they enter up at the news where I've watched that we're interrupting is so far as ... [laughter]\nI ... it was it was ... it was before they even knew if John F. Kennedy was alive or dead wow\nYeah before that you listen to it and you'll hear them oh yeah well there you know at least the concern was down in Texas and he was having confrontations you know he was ambassador to the un at that time you know he and then there were some right wing groups who are upset with him who are confronting him over some ... ... you know et cetera so they weren't making this that\nAnd Edward what what were the politics of the men that killed John F. Kennedy\nI yeah he's a Marxist\nCommunist Cuba Soviet Union loving communist like Bernie Sanders\nMary he was married to he got married to a a to a woman from the survey\nYeah marina yes the Russian she's a Soviet\nYeah war bride yeah mail order bride\nYeah I and I I don't think this woman had anything to do with it but this fascination though I mean primary from what I've read she had she had no nothing but at any rate he had his he you know he it showed where his liberty for the guy was not job to begin with you know like any right he was a Marxist and that's that's\nWho yeah well that's fascinating that's that's fascinating I'm Glad you're sure that I got to go look for that too\nYeah yeah I got a lot of it I mean in in ... in terms of you know in terms of hey you know what you guys have the media ... the the the problem is your problem is that you don't want anybody competing\nYou know what you guys have the media ... the the the problem is your problem is that you don't want anybody competing with your narrative and that's really the ... and I'm I'm not buying it OK yeah\nAnd a lot of America at least half of us aren't buying it either so you know you know just the way it is right when I go to when I get to the polls is next week or\n... you know to me it's about ... what's gonna be strengthen the economy going forward ever since Donald Trump taking the reins of president\nThis economy has skyrocketed and I you know and it's because of his influence its policies it was that I I felt that the nation was being held back for eight years that the nation want it to search for it\n[noise] [noise] Hey Chris thanks for taking my call you about that like like you I probably I came from a liberal family uh from New York I'm Jewish and I think that\nOr water or a pro grew up they\nGot started for Russia my family they put you crave my family gave them\nThe hungry ... is a blob out loud [noise] well and\nHe's he's the big anti Semite they don't evidently said so they just go about anti Semite as though you already know and I have that audio coming up as a matter of fact a dog\nFrom the fraudsters morning joke a this morning [noise] um his daughter Yvonne draw the blonde one she converted to Judaism they're orthodox\nOn the only plant continues next time your mid term election destination the heaviest he's won over one ... the ... time\nABC News\nI'm Scott Goldberg demand accused of opening fire inside of Pittsburgh synagogue killing eleven people has been released from the hospital Robert Bowers is expected in federal court this afternoon where he faces twenty nine charges including murder and hate crimes rabbi Jeffrey Myers was leading a service at the tree of life synagogue when the attack happened and he tells ABC News when\nAmerican citizens cannot [noise]\nReally and safely worship\nIn their house of worship and celebrate their Sabbath then it's not just an attack on just the Jewish community [noise] this is an attack upon all Americans a deadly\nRampage has triggered high alerts that synagogues across the country according\nTo the Anti Defamation league the number of anti Semitic incidents dumped a stunning fifty seven percent from two thousand sixteen to two thousand Seventeen and just last friday a new report showed as we head to the midterms there's been a spike in negative rhetoric on social media targeting Jews especially Jewish journalist\nABC News chief justice correspondent Thomas Cesar ... the man arrested for sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump also expected in court this afternoon this comes as another possible devices been discovered in the u._s. postal inspection service notifying the FBI of yet another suspicious package\nThis time address to CNN in Atlanta the package was intercepted edited land area post office and the preliminary assessment is that it is similar to the other pipe bomb like devices sent last week\nIf confirmed to be related to those other packages that would make Fifteen total devices ABC's mark rental art in Miami the national Transportation Safety board is sending a team of investigators to Indonesia after Boeing seven thirty seven crash this morning\nOn one hundred eighty nine passengers on board are believed to be dead in North Carolina a student has died after being shot inside butler high school this morning near Charlotte the suspected shooter has been arrested\nOn Wall street the Dow is up one hundred eight points the NASDAQ is fourteen you're listening to ABC News\nThings you find the latest coverage online anytime one oh four one K.

[noise]\nHas been arrested for that crime he's part a seminal Indian and Bert Filipino [noise] so the news media just doesn't\nSay tastes are because it's too ethnic they want to strip him of his ethnicity kind of like George Zimmerman it's the same program they have with that they're all very racist everything must be pushed through the the city of of racism of of ethnicity of race before they settle\nAnd then on Saturday and and again I'm Glad we caught that creepy is a a nut case a mental case law and criminal history long history of ah\nOf even bomb threats in the past one against the electric company threatened to blow up the electric company over some issue had with the you know the power company and uh so he's not he's a cook\nAnd his apparently a Trump fan so we set up these these fake bombs that none of them were that were aware of where capable of actually detonating capable of going off for whatever reason we don't know for sure that story of course fell by the wayside on Saturday\nWhen a horrible massacre took place at a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nPennsylvania and um and the news media as we know are only capable of talking about in covering one story at a time\nAnd this horrible story emerged on on Saturday and there were eleven people killed at this\nThe anti police rhetoric Brock Obama and the Democrats led directly to that and to Dallas where five police officers were murdered and I think seven more wounded to Baton Rouge or three or was it for more were murdered and another suicide attacks suicide attacks suicide attacks\nAnd the anti place rhetoric of course was never the problem in the news media all the Democrats and Obama and the anti play there everybody's racist other place to raise his\nHands up don't shoot never happened never that and and that's from Eric Holder who says when they go low we kick them\n... and and that rhetoric never manifest itself in any way all the political violence to the left over the last several years now are not really a part of their record ... none of it went on their permanent record none of that goes on their report card as far as the media is concerned\nIt's it's truly extraordinary and I put that question out this morning\nAbout whether or not what it is that you're going to be voting about what it is you're going to be when you go into the voting booth a week from tomorrow what is it that's going to be going through your mind what is it that you're thinking about now when it comes to when it comes to voting and and MS DNC this morning\nI turn them out at six am I on the DVR I can do all kinds of magic tricks\nAnd I looked at them within the first five six minutes\nThere were at least four or five pushes to get out the vote for the Democrats\nAnd there's no Yarborough guy I I guess he used to be a Republican or something they're they're literally five or six four four or five in the first five or six minutes pushes to get out the vote you have to I have at least one of those that are going to get to this morning\nHey [noise] if you're like most people that I Know that you are and you're driving along and you you see two gas stations one is selling gas for less

some money here and there\nBut sometimes we save a few cents here and there and we forget about the fact that we can save huge money in other areas life changing amounts of money if you switch to met a share for your health care it could mean massive saving for you and for your family\nThe savings for a typical family it's about five hundred dollars a month to think about that\nThat's about six thousand dollars a year that's after tax money that's serious money and people love met a share because met a share works met a share as believers you share each other's healthcare across\nThere are

something but it's coming back and he'd like to be forgiven that's okay though\nA potential democratic voters so the Democrats are I write about George ... philosopher guess is of course a Clinton Administration official a a a former Democrat Capitol Hill staffer\nA lifelong Democrat political an apparatus pick of the Democratic party and then he was hired by ABC News to become their chief anchor and spent sixteen hours a week on air or is it Twenty one hours I Can't remember a buddy he's a he's a Democrat\nAnd he's a funny little fella and he was on television yesterday\nAnd of course it's a there was a massacre and it's all Trump's will buy a Trump hater he's an anti Semite I see no reason to believe that Trump is an anti Semite\nAnd ah the news media doesn't care about that they just got their brush all this stuff out about the killer being anti Trump and hating Trump and saying Trump is controlled by the Jews on the international Jewish conspiracy they just leave all that out\nBecause you have to remember the most insidious power the news media has the power to ignore\nAnd they've been doing a lot of that this weekend because they're extremely corrupt [noise] George\n... she's a Democrat\nAcross social media feeds an anti Semitic them are ramping on on the rise all against the backdrop of the ugliest political climate in modern times at the counter an unapologetically whom the president on travelling by traditional norms of civility\nYeah well the traditional norms of civility or is that Democrats call you a Hitler and the news media says why do you think he's Hitler and then if you say don't be ridiculous they say it's not that hate speech\nBecause of people like George Stephanopoulos being hired by ABC and kept cities and Disney to pretend to be an objective journalist when everyone knows that he's not he is a a Clinton Administration official\nTo pretend to be an objective journalist when everyone knows that he's not\nHe is a a Clinton Administration official with a megaphone\nThat's all don't pretend these anything else every now and that it you know dresses up a little bit to make it look like oh I'm a journalist now I'm all grown up I'm wearing my dad's clothes and and in reality he's just a Democrat Party operatic\nSenator Chris Coons say for all the Democrats he defeated a woman that they painted as a witch you remember this as a witch because she had been hanging out with some Democrats I read the story a couple of the last couple of weeks there have been cousins of riches\nTo cast spells on ...\nOn justice Brett Kavanaugh and on Donald Trump\nThese are the Democrats so you know if you're worship Satan\nRosemary's Baby year right Hillary voter that's pretty much all there is to that Chris Coons he defeated a witch and uh it's all Trump's fault\nOr national political culture is motivating folks who are inspired by ... by fear by bigotry\nYeah at at the media is very focused on this they're not very focused on this round members of the Trump family got white powder in envelopes they don't really care about that when the president the White House the secretary of defense the chief of naval operations the secretary of the air force the CIA director and the FBI Director\nOr get white packets with a white powder which is supposed to be rice and that was in fact a castor bean based\nA powder which is what rice and has made from the news media didn't care about that when congressman state's college was shot in an attempt at mass assassination by a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nThe news media didn't really spend a lot of time on that these are not big stories these are not a big deal\nThey were all motivated by left wing rhetoric\nAnd I don't like the term hate speech because it's a lie and pretty much everything that's on CNN all day long and said speech shrunk Todd hey plays the sewers or phone or what is it it's the French horn he plays the French short\nAnd he sits in his office and he plays the friendship that he's a big journalist too he's of course a former Democrat Party Senate campaign staffer Chuck Todd as and he doesn't like the rhetoric\nIs hard not to look at it and say that it is connected we've seen this why then sort of a hot political rhetoric we say to rise in anti Semitic attacks have seen a rise in have filled the beach and there's been this concern oh somebody's going to get hurt somebody's going to get hurt [noise] um and yet somebody died after Charlottesville\nAnd we said well we got to tone it down somebody's going to get hurt\nYeah when did you say that when when when was that was that after um was that after the Bernie Sanders volunteer was when was that run exactly was that\nAdam Schiff lists is a mystery and he's the insure them as friends call them the interim his wife ... everyone goes in the interim because if you were to make a cartoon of Adam Schiff was it would have to be an inch worm with a little club striped tie\nLittle tie on where the insurer and a little teeny tiny mouth and a Adam Schiff was is not an honest man a at and and and keep in mind that the order of the day now as we need to dial down the rhetoric because the rhetoric is leading the bad things in reality what they mean is Republicans need to shut up\nTrump needs to shut up Fox News needs to shut up talk radio needs to shut up because that's the answer every tied on and of course when James Hodgkinson shows up and started shooting the place up\nBecause that's the answer every tied and of course when James Hodgkinson shows up and start shooting the place up they don't have this discussion this is not a part of the discussion it's not their\nCauses this it's a it's got nothing to do with Bernie Sanders or other Democrats [noise] it's got nothing to affect that he is a huge fan of Rachel Maddow and MSNBC [noise] it's got the air is no connective\nTissue at all even though they're extremely direct connections there in the same sleeping bag together with a lot of lubricant they they are his Facebook page James Hodgkinson was his name was covered with a Bernie Sanders pictures and then campaign set big campaigner\nMet with Bernice people at his office all this stuff Adam Schiff let's see knows what's dividing us\nI think this person's whole modus operandi or is to divide us\nThat's what all politicians have been ... I'm Sorry Hillary Clinton or as Hillary Clinton had anything to say about uh the deplorable send America that Hillary Clinton was not dividing us raise taxes\nOn the phone they fall back on the phone bank you name it\n... and broccoli Obama telling us to get in everybody's face is that that was not divisive and and do the police obviously acted stupidly and a brother can't get a fair shake and then police officers are being assassinated in targeted killings carried out by suicide attackers who are all Democrats against police officers\nAcross the country and New York and New Orleans in Baton Rouge and beyond in Ferguson to police officers were shot\nA and not killed got shot during the riots there without cutting everybody needed free her extensions and it was all because of hands up don't shoot which didn't happen but that didn't stop Brock Obama Eric Holder from seizing upon it\nAnd tearing the country apart along racial lines and against police are asking any police officer out there how things were before Obama versus after\nObama on the streets of America Eli misspell a this is MSNBC MSNBC it's all those terrible Republicans start\nLetting in Republican Party off the hook they are the beneficiary fair right\nThere the Republicans are the beneficiaries ever sorry the Democrats wanted to keep their slaves that's where I had the civil war\nA morning show a this is and this is Joe ... old Joe ...

I'm going to be getting ready to sell this sucker since I you know use it for work at ... and I won't be doing that anymore and I'm Wondering it's got a ... about three years old I'm almost lifted on it I'm Wondering what the minimum I might need to\nTake for it is do you have an idea what that might\nBe a your vehicle is over for two fifty percent of the bullet proof put on it\nI ... you can look at the ... value and I I Would look into book value but\nIn the book value on it doesn't really apply to the older diesels that's been taken care of and have the bullet proof zone it knowledge stuff\nYeah I have the inspectors replaced too at the same time about I don't know four years ago mhm three years we should be a good runner should be hired on it's\nIt's fine I'm just thinking well\nA book that he doesn't really let you put in for it you know bullet proof and [noise] you know specifics heavy duty stuff like\nThat with the price of a new diesel does okay\nRA in Tucson, Arizona like like my own six okay I think they're going to like ten grand and I've got two hundred and one thousand miles on it ain't no way I'm selling it for ten grand imam Eighteen I might do Nineteen but I'm not ...\n... a good vehicle yours the way you've done it and keep up with it\nAnd go you can there's all sorts of books out there like ... and you can Google and in fact you can just Google it says what is the\nSuggested price to shale a two thousand and four two fifty with a hundred and Eighteen K on it\nWith a bullet proof on it but I just put it right into Google and see what your average prices are should give you three price range or another thing you can do is call Lynn's alter brokers at six to eight Seventy five hundred well I talked to Dana\nOkay [noise] and that's going to be the big the big killer is heat there's only two things going to take out her transmission one is just pure drag racing the other one is heat and he is generated from towing day I've done blown up transmission showing a no no what brings them out\nBut you have a a good unit you keep your service opponent follow the recommendations that in your Emanuel\nUnder severe duty Tucson is a severe duty shady the south West is a severe duty city west Texas is severe duty ignore the normal duty and go to the severe duty and your protect your vehicle\n[noise] okay okay\nAll right and what the other question I had was the same shot that was telling me I Need a slush says that I Need shocks all around so I kind of looked at them myself because I've done shocks they're not\nActors or mhm but in in the front it it almost to me I mean I'm not a mechanic but [noise] you know just can do little things sure that\nIt almost looks like a a small ... ... in there and I'm like okay so then I kind of Google that around and I couldn't find out if it's a strut or if it's just a shock with call over around ... call over yeah [noise] so is\nThere is have let me ask you another question now All right on your front end do you have any weird tire where in other words you or your tires wearing flat or do they have feathers on them\nUm you know which means you can rub your hand across in just feel like somebody sitting there with a little file against your hand is you go across the top of the\nCar and I don't know\nUm you know which means you can rub your hand or crossing you feel like somebody sitting there with a little file against your hand as you go across the top of the tire\nFeathering just kind of normal you know like from turning right or left you know just normal driving out on the outside just a little bit yeah uh but nothing that I Would consider abnormal 'cause I have seen feathering tire sure and they had seen like ... where are we are not but I don't have anything\nAbnormal like that that I consider abnormal so I think okay what do I really need shots are not\nAlright when's the last time you had that thing into shop and had to run in the land that they give you a computer printout telling you that it yes it is a land or no it's not they give you a before and after like Brian pulled her desk\nI haven't because I haven't noticed any like usually when I could get to get an alignment\nI'll start to notice like you said on the tires or I'll start to feel something kind of pull on the steering wheel and how to sell anything abnormal so I haven't taken it to get on an island I've just been doing oil changes for the lab huh you know for a while\nWhen you stop it on the road you take it out on the back roads you knew you get up about forty miles an hour\nWith no traffic around you any place and you lock that son of a gun down hold it will both hands lock it down and see if it's ducking or diving in front end because all the way it's going to transfer to the front in shock people when I'm Bad it we'll let you know because you will die to the week said\nOkay okay ah I think it a little premature on that or however it is you start watching your shocks and stretch at sixty thousand miles and then you go from there the the five point seven does not way as much as a Cummins Diesel okay\nAnd my daughter my granddaughter I was in Monticello Mick I'm Arkansas so we took it down way out of town about an hour to go this fancy barbecue place\nComing back we're cruising along and I we were talking about ... years in the road and stuff like that and so she is running about fifty mile an hour and his fifty five zones so she was driving like supposed to pay attention\nOf a sudden she goes to the break to search bringing it down and I watched the vehicle as we were coming down because I was wondering you know we put new shocks on that thing and I want to see if they're still there because you knew shocks replaced about two and a half years ago\nAnd she come all the way down the abs work perfect pitch it was squeal a little didn't late goats and stop it is so they BS was working for perfect a break check and she bumped the deer\nThat's how far she brought it down all the way down to where just bumped the deer and it looked like the deer said well what was that all about and then he tried it all on off so we got lucky there it stopped straight without the ducking and diving\nShocks you can ride around you get used to them but you don't know what you're going to do until you run across an emergency and you have to lock that son of a gun down\nAnd most of the time when you have to lock them down like on the freeway when everybody run in Seventy five eighty five mile an hour and then they lock it down in front of you also you see the brake lights come on you get after it and then you start pulled into the right hand side are you up to the right and ... back to the left\nSo do the oh basic common knowledge thing just go get out there on a on a on a road when nobody around on the ... not on dirt road 'cause we won't work\nBut goat and just jump on that break and hang don't don't pump abs system put your foot on a break and hold it and give it a chance for the electronics to work\nAnd see what you've got I doubt very seriously or you could have but I'd\nIt can hold it and give it a chance for the electronics to work\nAnd see what you've got I doubt very seriously or you could have but I ... I don't know do you live on a dirt road no okay so do you like to hit a this another reason I'd like to you to get him for an inland his because nobody can drive around Tucson without hitting a pothole\nI hit a particular disease is no doubt about that\nWell I Would have this thing checked to make sure and when they're checking if you take it too good will enrich shop they will check your shocks at the same time we used to be able to do a bounce remember back in the day when you use to bounce a car and see if okay if it goes down and comes back up and settled back within a bouncer and a half then shocked good\nUntil I met a shock manufacture\nAt the same as show in Las Vegas and he explained to me that there's about a three aids part of that shock that runs most of the time\nThat it will wear out you can hit a heavy bump and you can't tell it but driving down the road that shock is not working for three eighths of an inch owner shank\nSo you know he said you you have to test them and and see what they are but you have to see where the loose bodies and um [noise]\nBut I Would think you know if you want to replace shocks catcher sale [noise] get yourself where you go to for one and keep in mind the right ah I see people replaced the front shocks and I see people replaced the rear shocks how many times do you hit a bump\nWith a front together and then the rear together only when you're going over a speed bump a little faster than you should ... if you hit a chuckle on the right front it's going to probably hit it on the right rear [noise] and so it breaks a shock or a ruptured a shock\nYou should have some fluids coming out of it or you can break up out of a shock\nOkay why I looked and I didn't see any fluids coming out of it ... and that's where the shop said that they said that he will but I didn't see any fluids so I'm thinking okay well do I really\nNeed to show emotion shock loads now when you first start to Lincoln comes out clear\nOr to be so playing you really have to pay attention to it you probably have to use a flashlight what I recommend you take a white paper towels\nAnd reach up in there and just wipe around the top of the shock you know where the ... on the shock go to the top of the shock and the bottom of the shock and see if you've got any clear fluids if you have clear fluids on in your leaking all of the flu it doesn't shock is keep it cool\nThat's not shocking it just keeps the shock cool it's telling you that eventually it's going to leak out and then the shock is going to start seizing up or a heating up going bad\nOkay All right All right well I appreciate all the advice and and I I'm grateful that is they have this show on and on the weekend\nWell I Hope you get your transmission flushed if you knew it flushes sixty nine I wouldn't [noise] okay and um because you don't do you don't qualify to have it ... right now if you brought in the shop with prompts me\nYou know you can do it if you really forces too and I've had people make me do it but ah now if it was ... I don't think so we take my granddaughter's oh six dodge and it's got to five point seven in it and we flush out thing about every thirty six thousand miles\nBut I also know six and she's also in Monticello, Arkansas and I don't want anybody else to touch it so we just pay attention and we check it and then the last time we checked it it ... it was it was fun and so we said okay we're going to take a fifty thousand miles [laughter] so and she is over a hundred\nIt was it was fun and so we said okay we're going to say could fifty thousand miles [laughter] so and she is over a hundred thousand on it so it fifty thousand miles you get a check just cause parks where out\nOK okay All right so good luck with that thank you very much I appreciate the help and the advice All right have a good weekend you too Bye bye Bye bye [noise]\nGood point good point on transmission pleasures if you've been listening to show for the twenty nine years I've been doing this show\nOr last year [noise] if it's liquid in a vehicle change it\nIt's designed to change I don't know any liquid that is a lifetime I look at a lifetime who's lifetime five years hundred thousand miles you know what's a lifetime of if you're going with it or you take it up here to Flagstaff you throw in a trailer weighs about seven thousand pounds I won't tell you something you agreed to meet at transmission\nYeah this is a link on and off like a like a cop car disconnected the horrors that to hear it\n[laughter] and the van runs a great even sees that works out for ten years a thing\n[laughter] well you got a good one so now you just can't figure out the alarm system we see a lot of alarm problems that are all owned the older than age and I to be honest with you I don't know what the guys the number one thing or finding with them but the shop does they know exactly what it is\nSo I don't know what side of town your own or where you're at where are you at\n... I live in dense with the cars here in Tucson and I'm closer to your shop\nOK we'll bring back coal weighed at eighty four oh two one seven and tell me and he gets thing in that far is that it's possessed because the alarm system keeps going on and off when nobody's trying to steal it\nHe also gave me a Cadillac I guess I'll pick up the early nineties low mileage that for ten years I Want to see if I Can't get that thing going\nWell is it what is it a big Cadillac full size yet this little ...\nYou're going to love that I was going to be around it's like you haven't had quite a few years [noise] yes it can be fixed but just take same precautions you did it fired and also make sure all the fluids or changing that lose the engine\nExactly and it's surprising mechanic that went over there with me I didn't watch this they fire up and up if I didn't have the necessary and I\nWell you got some garbage feeling and I'll guarantee that\nOh yeah see I got them out first thing why even try and put a battery in very\nWell you've done it before you're you're right on spot I appreciate it Jerry already have a good one thinks they're All right\nBye bye a lot of\nAlarm systems uh I run into one you a while back in Arkansas and it they said what's this little thing right here and I said that somebody took off and after market alarm because they put after market alone they put the a power supply to the wrong location\nA so if you have a a Carl army goes on and off like that yeah sometimes it's something simple to fix sometimes you just have to take the darn thing out depends on what the value your vehicle is that Ninety nine dodge caravan is not going to be worthwhile to age two thousand sixteen two thousand fourteen dodge pick up\nA car alarms are good you know most of the groups out there are no doubt about past most of them [noise]\nUm so if you have a GPS and it's a little harder they may steal your vehicle but you can always find it\n[laughter] if it's anything left of it but I'm In a\nCar alarms are nice they're nice or you know I've got 'em all my stuff and but I have a different set on my dodge than you do I have a alarm it has a little button on it takes one thousand one hundred combination to bypass that\nOr you can put the key back on the cat back on top of an effort right off I can leave the doors unlocked you can go in I can leave the keys indignation you turn the key on listen to the radio you can do everything but you can't start it you can't drive it\nSo that that's what I like specially on search and rescue and these outlying areas okay let's go to Dick Dick good morning\nMarch ... got a question on tire so I Know the drill pretty much all I've got a shuttle eight or nine year old a ... page on an SUV seasonal rushing in town about six months or years showing the cars Raj um they don't have insurance\nIt's a little restaurant in town about six months or your shoulder cars garage [noise] um [noise] they don't even show up Mike Rowe crack on the side ... I Know the drill says there should be replaced but would you replace him a little ...\nWhat do you do with it what do you all\nAre ride both around calving occasionally trips up to ... once in a while to Southern California\nAll right take your vehicle when you when you get off the phone or since my programs over used equipment nuts Fifteen minutes but I'm\nTaking vehicles going to be a nice sunny day out today turn the wheels to the left side that'll be the driver's side you get out you go around and you look in between the treads\nAnd you see if there's any cracks on that thing between the treads now one way to keep these things last my dad used to drive until they blow up\nBut the the way you can find it when it's been garage and setting there is one they're setting okay that's not good they need to be laying down and not setting up\nBut they're setting up because of your own your car and the stern Karl sideways [noise]\nSo you look inside and you you you look to see if there's any cracks between the tread running around the tires\nShe if you can spot any little ones squat down and take a good look at it and make sure now the reason I'm telling you this because if it has those cracks I'm a chicken I Will not drive it to the Knicks I Will drive it around Tucson until the go flat because I've got access to\nYou know frontier toe in and you know I can get it handled Michelin is a good tired it's solved rubber compound\nUh I've driven them until the side walls was so hard I had to replace it because they started chunk in all owned the tread itself they started actually breaking off the tire dries out\nSo that's the big thing that you got to watch and when they start checking out replace them don't even question that just go replace all four of them okay\nBut if it's just got to cracks in between they are not designed to cool the tire they are ... they're dried out\nAnd it's time to take a good look at him before you hit to sustain runs like me here to San Diego here to Las Vegas or I don't like go from here to Phoenix 'cause wrote temperatures\nWhen it's hot outside you well you got a hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty degree wrote temperatures and they're going to dry out really fast if they've already started drying out and that's when your tires are normally come apart\nThat and if it's low air low air pressure the air pressure has to be right on them have to keep them up so that the the sad balls and wires\nDoesn't create additional heat inside the tires\nCrashed and they had no cracks no cracks not if you're going to take to Phoenix you can drive hey you can drive it with the\nHalf the trade coming off around who's on as long as you drive around fifty mile an hour but I had too many tires come apart that looked\nPerfect\nThey were where dated the Goodyear recommends you know four to five years I think they moved they say four to five years depending on how what what is used for where it's a house how its house or how the humidity is humidity huge humidity is a huge factor on these things but\nIf you see any of the little cracks running between or don't kid yourself I'd back it up about a half a foot soccer check the rest of the ... if you have any bigger ones come in because they're not going away and why you got to turn to laugh go round look at the right front\nAnd if you've had your tired rotated at the same time they're ... just like the ...\nAnd why you got to turn to laugh go round look at the right front and if you've had your guard rotated at the same time than the backs of looked just like the ... except you don't have to get down and crawl around the vehicle look at it\nOkay tell all I've done I've done that and also there's a reason and cash the perfect ... years to get rid of them\nIt's I because I Can't tell you what to side walls are done I don't know what to dredge done I don't know how to drive they actually are you know I bought a Mustang off the east coast brought it in got it in my brother told me he actually drove the carpet it up on the trailer in North Carolina sent it to me\nAnd we backed it off and it tires from twenty foot looked like they were brand new and they weren't brand new about Nineteen sixty nine\nAnd when it backed off the truck\nAnd I put it on frontier going to send it to my home the tires when frontier drop it off for me the tire tread on three\nThree tires were over half way off and the fourth tire had just started at about an eighth of the circumference off and they look just perfect setting on the trailer there were no cracks on the sides either and it was inside a little garage in Carolina where all the moisture but to come apart the gang\nI don't like driving I don't you change the terms I rode lately\nLow fat God yep\nWell you want to continue that right\n[laughter] I Would not I I I'm just paranoid retires because I just come off a twenty six hundred mile trip seen a lot of stuff that people could have prevented and some of the cars in Arkansas they don't really take good care of those and um but you know in Texas on the freeways knock on wood\nAh the only ones that are saying they were all phone side roads and stuff like that are truckers truckers oh there's those alligators those big alligators oh by the way if you're driving down the freeway don't hit one of those causing do a lot of damage to the vehicle\nAnd ah but they were all over the place I mean taxes was just just they had\n... all everywhere and you say you spend most of your ... they don't have any chuckles and freeways but they do have those alligators which I'd rather have a chuckle when an alligator 'cause that thing likes to roll up under the bottom side and beat the crap out of your vehicle\nSo yep a there that's my personal and professional opinion on your tires are as a reason they put a date on him\n[noise] [noise] oh it's so good\nSo you can run around town as long as you want to because you've got access to a two tier change or somebody if something happens but I don't freeway Seventy five miles an hour\nThat's our gift to you we've been doing it for about twenty five years we want to keep you out for Thanksgiving we want you to get their good as you can\nWe can't do all the repairs after time you\nBring it in its schedule we will give you the ... show you some of his stuff you'll be able to

Debbie\nAnd joining me in the studio this morning as mark ... good morning every one and a special guest that we've had\nOnce before and really enjoyed having or so we've asked her to come back today carry see with perfect behavior solutions good morning so we are glad that you took time to drive down to the Tucson area from up in the Phoenix metroplex area to spend some time with us this morning talking about cats and cat behavior\nSo thank you so much for taking out some time this morning to do that of course my pleasure\nAnd we've had just fun chit chatting before the show about it\nSo thank you so much for taking out some time this morning to do that of course my pleasure and we've had just fun chit chatting before the show about random things and I want to let our listeners out there since the last time we talked to we were talking about\nThat we would be in construction for a little bit and our practice would have to be temporarily closed well the good news is that we are back\nOpen today now only part of the practice is able to be used but we are definitely functional and we thank everyone out there who has been patient through this construction time and phones not being able to be answered because we had no phones so\nWe thank you very much for your patience and if you have any needs and I've been trying to get in contact with us please don't hesitate to call our hospital phone number is five four four seven seven zero zero shows are up and running no thank goodness [laughter] we\nJust rolled out the ability to take text messages will right at the right time so you can also Texas member\nYeah and that's been really helpful during this construction time because we have still at least been able to communicate with our clientele about their pets in their needs during this time where we couldn't actually pick up a phone [laughter] the\nOne more thing goes restructure note I found out our superintendent on the project listens to the show\nStarted last night [laughter] and you're listening to like you for the hard work you put it out it was really hard to stay out of his way yesterday we heard there was a little stress yeah I think everybody\nWas a little bit on edge yesterday just trying to get everything finished that we could open up a those new half the warnings so it looks ... yeah yeah and so I think people will be very pleased to see um the the way things have changed over there [noise]\nUm so if you have any questions or comments especially regarding kitty cats and they're interesting behaviors give us a call here at the studio\nSeven five one one oh four one that's one of the reasons that we have carry here because that's what she\nWas she helps to work with our little furry feline friends and some of the interesting behaviors that they might develop and some of the not so pleasant to behaviors that they might develop over time depending on what's going on in their home environment is an alien trainer yes she is [laughter]\n[laughter]\nShe shaking your head at your mark [laughter] so anyway Kerry you have a background that has allowed you to actually work with specific behaviors and you've also been in a very veterinary field for a little while to subpoena give us\nAnd our listeners a little bit of detail about how you got started in dealing with kitty cats and your veterinary technician background and now your degree for dealing with behaviors\nYeah so cats have always been something that have been a part of my life we actually started fostering kittens when I was in middle school um we had hundreds of kittens come through my house my parents and very grateful that they let me have that adventure\nUm 'cause they gotta deal with strays and Farrell and moms and babies and bottle feeding and kind of that whole world I'm so so much fun when I was younger\nUm and then I started as a veterinary technician really as soon as I could get a job on and that was so much fun working in the veterinary field and seen\nThe different things in there and the medical problems and also behavioral issues at the vet clinic as well um and then from there I decided to get my masters in companion animal behavior and counseling\nAnd open my own business and cats are really just my passion not a lot of people want to work with cats they do think there aliens\n[laughter] a lot of [laughter] a lot of these kind of\nYou know they think they're just so independent and they can't be trained and you know all these ... here all day long about you've trained cats of what you can actually change their behavior\nAnd you know all these miss that I hear all day long about you've trained cats of what you can actually change their behavior and you know I just tell people you can change anything ... you just have to find the right motivation for it so yeah it's it's definitely my passion and it's it's a job that I just love it's not even really a job\nAnd yeah and when you love to do something that really isn't a job anymore and so and that way people can see how passionate you are about what you do because for you this is\nYour life it's fun and exciting and out of it may be stressful sometimes but it's not a negative stress it's going to be one of those more positive stresses that you're like I'm going to be able to accomplish this and be able to help this particular cat and their family get through whatever the issue is [noise]\nAnd so you've also recently started doing a workshop I saw on your website that you had done a little\nLike group like twenty people are so that got together and and you were doing a little bit of teaching on what some of these cat behaviors are and talking to people that are in a shelter environment trying to see what they could do to help improve the adaptability of some of these kitty cats so how did that little lecture series go for you for them was it helpful\nPlus I'm back to ... talk and we are talking with Cary see with perfect behavior solution\nBack to pet talk and we're talking with Cary see with perfect behavior solutions and that is P. U. R. R.\nS. E. C. T. so if you have any questions for her please call us at seven five one one for one or you can certainly contact her through email and she has a wonderful website that will give you all sorts of information about what she does and the\nTypes of common behavioral problems that we can see with cats and that's one thing I Want to talk about now during the few minutes we have before we have to take our break at the half\nIs some of the more common behavioral issues that you run across and that people are calling you about and saying how in the world do we solve this problem with our cat\nThe number one issue and I actually have I think three new clients and the past week that I'm Talking about this as being outside the litter bottoms\nAnd it is one of the most common issues that I come across and it's really not a simple fix like a lot of people would think um you know there's so many reasons it did it start as a medical thing and that's always the first thing whenever there's any inappropriate elimination\nFirst thing we do as a ... check whether that do we have a you ... do we have crystals do we have pain 'em 'cause that can be a huge deterrent for using the litter box if there was ever any sort of pain getting into the litter box and things like that um so yeah that's it that's a huge one\nYeah and when I have clients come in with that as a primary complaint it's usually going to be one of my longer appointments having to discuss with them all the ins and outs of the medical side of things and then the behavioral side of things and what are we going to do to try to correct as behavioral issue that as you said can often start off as a medical issue [noise]\nSomething has given them an aversion to that litter box and all of a sudden it turns into a behavioral issues even though you may have solved that original version issue\nAnd now you've got a cat it was like well I was being outside the litter box and everything was fine and I'll just keep being outside the litter box but\nIt is a very frustrating problem cat here and it's really hard smell to get out of a house and that's [noise] pardon me one of the reasons why people are going to say I got to fix this problem because that's not where I Want my cat to be eliminating they need to be using their litter box that we can properly clean the house\nAnd so I Know I have multiple things in my tool box what are some of the things that you will used to talk to clients about to get the key to get back in the box\nSo usually besides you know making sure it's not medical the first thing I Do is look at the environment\nAnd making sure we have enough litter boxes seeing what type of literature we're using what's the placement of those litter boxes actually had a client I'm a couple of months ago that her cat was outside the litter box for three years\nOh my goodness I Know I was like oh you're a saint for for this cat and\nYou know most people are like a week and they're like I'm done\nI'm you know we talked about the policemen of the litter box and realize that it's the only litter box in this house was at the end of this long hallway that the dog to sleep in front of ... and the cat does not get along with the dogs because the dogs chase her\nSo why is she going to go down that way where are these scary these are guarding it when she has to go to the bathroom of course she's going to find a different place to go I'm so taking a look at environment is a huge\nHuge factor and just trying to get into the head of the kitty like okay what could be possible stressors and that's another thing too is stress can be a huge factor um a lot of people you know even though it's not stressful for you and I it can be really stressful for a kitty like when you go out of town\nFactor um a lot of people you know even though it's not stressful for you and I it can be really stressful for a kitty like when you go out of town and the schedule changes and things like that your cat is never mad\nAt you and being outside of the litter box to get back at you I hear that all the time is you know they just aren't spiteful creatures they don't have that ability I'm Sorry but humans are really the only ones that have\nThat [laughter] [laughter] we don't take advice [laughter] if we should not be taking you to argue [laughter] I was a good\nRecord barbecues things we do think about the editor of cats but it it affected my dog as well but\nUh if you had a litter box in the laundry room mhm address them it's a pretty hard period or sonic sound mhm but you as a human might not think about but maybe that's why the customer use now looks so thinking about things try to get as you said of the head of your ...\nOr even having plug in ... around the litter box you know those smells tell us they might they might smell pleasant but they can be really strong for the kitty and a lot of people put them or right over the litter box thinking like oh I'm going to drown out the smell and it's like\nNo you're just going to get that from somewhere you don't want it sounded the spray would've goats yeah yeah I get a retired scary too that you are a startling even for me when I Walk\nBy them back [laughter] and all of a sudden it is [laughter] so I Can't blame them for that one yeah unless you were\nMentioning sometimes what type of litter so ... is a real big thing for cats to as you might not realize that you get the scented cat litter so that you can try to cover up the smell of whatever they're putting in that box and your cat might not like that or the texture of what the litter is like there are so many different options out there today that you sometimes have\nTo play around with what type of literature they might actually like and given the multiple options at the same time to go to and then you can see which\nOne does my cat litter box buffet as [laughter] which might be a little expensive upfront\nBut in the long run if you can find that litter that really does it for your kitty and they liked digging in it and they like going to the bathroom in it you know they we all have texture preferences and so to our cats\nAnd so you need to find something that works and then also littered that some people don't realize that sometimes cats like to dig a lot in their litter box and if they are hitting the bottom of the box and they can't dig anymore they're like well why do I want to go here I Want to dig\nAnd the other thing to to remember is sometimes what's working might change and you don't like the same things for your entire life\nBut we often expect our cat you know you start with clay letter from day one and you expect him for the next Twenty years to use that\nAnd sometimes their preferences change especially as they get older and you might need to switch to a different type of litter and that's okay you know don't have that expectation that everything's going to remain the same for the entire life of that cat\nLitter box size depth and whether or not it's covered is another big thing and the new thing out there it's not totally new but it's having these electronic litter box is clean themselves after your cat goes to the bathroom well we already talked about the drier that can make noise when these litter boxes are not quiet [laughter]\nAnd they're often small yes they are very small I look at them um the original one rectangular shape box that had a rake that went from one end to the other and dumped it into a receptacle at the end and then would break it back\nA not a very large litter box at all maybe for a kitten it might work but once you have a large sometimes Fifteen twenty pound adult cat [noise]\nUh not a very large litter box at all maybe for a kitten that might work but once you have a large sometimes Fifteen twenty pound adult cat\nAnd the amount of debris that they can put in that litter box and they don't work as well and now the newer one um that his round again it's very hard for a normal sized adult cat to fit in there and be able to get that stretching behavior that they want to be able to dig a cat's if you've ever watched them\nMost most people don't want to watch their cats go to the bathroom if you've ever watched them in the litter box there do you do or maybe makes me worry a little bit [laughter] I haven't really had a problem than another box I have to it\nSo they are they dig they sniffed around they turn they dig in another spot they sniff that they turn I mean there's a lot of motion that goes along before they actually decide to eliminate in that box\nAnd then it's the do I cover it up or not question because I have some that do in some that don't kind of look at and go and get out of the box and other ones are obsessive compulsive about trying to cover it up so much so that now they're going up the walls trying to get the wall to come down to cover up their litter or their their mess in the box so\nEach cat has their own very specific behavior and their likes and dislikes about using that Fox and so we have to cater to the kitty cat mhm\nDoes that extend to also where the opening of some kind of want to come down into the litter box versus ones that go into the side you also have to consider that\nAnd that's been very popular thing these days to is having not top opening one ... on and yeah we have to consider that especially if we have older cats\nUm because sometimes they can't jump you know they're starting to develop arthritis and things like that and so jumping in and out of the box becomes really difficult for them\nAnd it may not be obvious to a pet owner watching the cat just walk around the house that oh well maybe they can get on to her off of this litter box\nBut it actually is a problem we see it more frequently than you might think and these cats that will be inside the box the poop outside the box\nThat's an interesting one for most people because they're used to it being reversed but that's usually going to be our older cats who to get in the box and to actually engage all of the pelvic muscular Cher and bones associated with actually having a bowel movement hurts\nAnd so ... is easy it's more of a passive process for some of these cats were actually having about movement is more of an active process and so then they start going\nThis is a lot of pain associated with being in this litter box to go to the bathroom and so yes we are going to have those cats who have an aversion to using the litter box to death of Kate when they're starting to get old and arthritic and that's something that some people kind of forget\nThat happens to them to you know us getting down on the toilet sometimes if we're sort is hard and so you can imagine if that's the same for your cat or your dog\nI Will say I'm so sad to admit that I have my first ever kept by\nAbout a month ago and it's actually passing clients cat um and it's this cat that we've been working with on his behavior because he gets so stressed out would have humans leave\nThat he just whenever I come in the house he just shocks me around the house and it's a very stressful situation for him and it's funny because I posted about my cat fight on line and it's it's funny it's his mouth looks huge it looks like the panther but [laughter]\nYou know I had a lot of negative comments from people like oh my gosh what a terrible cat what a bad cat no he was so stressed out that his parents had were gone and I'm the stranger coming in his home invading his space I have to go in there to feed him\nAnd I have to walk towards him because that's where the litter boxes and you know stress is a huge reason that these cats become aggressive and it's usually not true aggression in the fact\nThat I Want to fight you I'm so mean it's usually I'm scared ... and this is how I defend myself by lashing out because I don't know what else did you because you keep coming towards me\nOn so a lot of that we can start young and I love kitten kindergarten um because you know we start with introducing them to new people\nI'm getting them used a different types of people people coming in and handling them and just building up again that positive association with these kind of scary strangers\nUm another thing that people do when they get a cat again we just throw 'em in the house you get a dog first thing you do sign up for puppy classes or dog classes take 'em to happy hour you do\nThe thing that people do when they get a cat again we just throw 'em in the house you get a dog first thing you do sign up for puppy classes or dog classes take him to happy hour you do things with them ... you get a cat there just in the house\nRight you don't you don't have people over and you're not like I just got this you know you want to come over and hang out with it like if you get a puppy every everybody coming right yeah and you didn't you know that's cool I'm not a cat person I don't want to you know new yeah if you get a new\nCat you don't have kitten kindergarten in the area well let me get [laughter] let's work on that\nUm that invite your friends over work on positive handling work on having different types of people in the home people wearing sunglasses and\nYou know different types of shoes and slowly dresses and things like that I might not be the norm so they get used to having those different types of people and always pair it with something really high value genetically food\nUm a lot of people you know they're like oh my cat doesn't he treats I'm not talking about temptations I'm Talking let's do some chicken let's do some salmon with just a baby food meat based baby food is usually super high value so it can quickly tell build up that positive association between\nYou know scary thing and hey scary thing really wonderful thing a lot of them we want them to come back\nYeah and so it takes time and patience with these cats too um but there can be some situations that are hard to deal with where the cat for whatever reason has decided that it has realized that can get away with us and getting away with behavior\nUnfortunately ends up reinforcing that behavior and that pets mind and so we have to work on\nHelping them understand that this behavior is inappropriate and what kind of re directions do you try to do and we have a cat who may be going out and flooding are biting at somebody and it looks like they're now seeking you out to do it [laughter]\n[noise] a lot of um what I recommend number one is management um because we don't want that the more the cat repeats that behavior of the more of a habit it become the more it's reinforced essentially um so the more we can prevent it from happening there that are\nAlso making sure your cat has enough distance making sure they're staying under their threshold using toys to redirect 'em pheromones are also really popular those are kind of hit and miss and another thing is\nI don't want my clients ever be afraid to talk to their ... about medications I hear so many times oh I don't want I don't want to have to put my cat on medication\nIt's not a bad thing it's never a bad thing because there are just some just kind of need a little bit of help you know it's like people [laughter] it's just like people and there's there shouldn't be any negative stigma around any of it because it just takes him down to a normal learning level\nAnd sometimes it depends on what it is that we're seeing in the kitty cat as to what type of medication that they might need and they can really help improve their training and re direction if we can get some of these brain chemicals a little bit more stabilized for these cats\nSo that then they can actually learn these new behaviors or redirect these old behaviors into more positive things\nDefinitely yeah it's it just takes them you know from my pen\nDown to six maybe and it just kind of helps them\nTo be able to have those herrings of positive things because once your cat is just kind of way off the wall\nThey're not learning anything you know they are just so focused on what could happen what scary what do I need to do next they need to stop this person and pounds and jump and bite and scrap\nKnow what could happen what scary what do I need to do next they need to stop this person and pounds and jump and bite and scratch they just don't have the opportunity so definitely setting them up for success is key um yeah that's really yeah and if there comes a point\nWhere medication is appropriate for your cat now you're going to be going on in the world am I going to get into the kitty cat\nWell the good news is that okay you got a cat that might be food motivated that's one way you can sometimes get that medication into a pill pocket or other soft treat that they could eat there are ways of flavoring liquid medications and then there's the lovely ...\nAs long as your cat will let you pet its head and its ears that is one of the safer ways to be able to administer certain types of medication not everything can be turned into a trans terminal\nBut it's one of the things we are constantly in contact with the ... Carey wellness and asking them\nCan you turn this medication into a transistor and will because we have a cat who will not ticket or early and I don't want my point to get hurt or the cat to spit it out [laughter] which is obviously counterproductive and so talk with your veterinarian about well is this something that we could do in a transistor mo Jo\nAs long as your cat let you get to the IRS that's one of the easiest ways for us to be able to administer certain types of medication but it has to be appropriate for that cat and the medication has to be able to be absorbed through the skin and so you need to have a good relationship with your veterinarian and your compounding pharmacy to figure out what's going to work for your kitty cat\nAnd I tell you they work with us we will call them and say okay this isn't working what other options do we have to try and they will help us out in that respect\nAnd another thing too is talk to your veterinarian if you have a behavioral issue a lot of these cats that just randomly become aggressive\nThere might be an underlying medical issue you know it might be paying it might be a bad teeth there's so many different causes hormones and exactly there's so many different reasons and a lot of the underlying ones can be medical\nUm so I always tell my clients make sure you're getting your cat in for regular checkups even if you think they're perfectly healthy just get 'em in\nYeah cats are so good at hiding when they're actually sick and we are we've discussed this many times is that they will hide the fact that something's not right with them until such time as it hits that threshold that it's obvious that they can hide it anymore and that's usually what we end up seeing is okay they've now been sick sick sick and they drop over this this little cliff\nAnd now we have an obviously sick cat that has been hiding the fact that there's something that we might have been able to do sooner\nMhm and another thing I'm a lot of people are scared of cats with kids ... um cats you know sometimes don't get along with kids because kids can sometimes he really scary they make loud noises they have\nWeird toys that they throw at the at the end you know the the cat sometimes are also forced to be loved by kids we have to remember\nKathy personal space to yeah they need a vertical cease to be able to get away from everything but still have that vantage point to be able to watch what's going on they need a separate area that if they want to take a break they can some cats don't like to be handled just like some people don't like to be\nYou know just kind of remembering each had as an individual and take that into account if you have a kid making sure that they understand the rules even with dogs you you know it's so important\nHaving kind of that boundary as discussion with everybody in the family and so that\nThe dog or the cat has their space or not for as much as you know everyone's like oh I just love my animals so much and it might be a burden to them you know\nNot for as much as you know everyone's like oh I just love my animals so much\nAnd it might be a burden to them you know sometimes they may not find it as fun as you do we do need to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to talk about the cat to chew on things that they shouldn't carry has personal experience with this and so we want to definitely take an opportunity to talk about that hanging there will be right back after this short message\nNothing as important as family edit idol rode animal hospitals your pets are treated like part of the family there will be seven days a week with twenty four hour nursing care that your pet will never be alone in their state of the facility they're integrated

and get some going that's going to help keep them happy and ultimately that's what we want to do is keep our cats engaged to keep their brains going and the right direction and tried to prevent some of these negative behaviors that you're having to come out and work with people on\nWell carry we want to thank you again for spending your Saturday morning with us coming down from the Phoenix metro

[noise] I'm Nathan Frederica vice president and Mayfield financial inundate protection services incorporated an asset and retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nVolatility is back in a big way as markets continue to get tossed around as more economic data keep\nPouring in and financial reports from various major companies are digested by analysts while key economic indicators are still showing signs of life in the economy along with a roaring job market and low unemployment\nThe fact remains that interest rates are starting to creep up in a big way and are feared by some to put the brakes on this red hot economy\nHome sales in fact are slipping in some areas with prices falling as mortgage rates have increased giving pause to would be home buyers\nAnd then some companies are reporting that terrorists costs are starting to hurt their bottom line\nMeanwhile the Federal Reserve continues to dig it heals into the ground on race saying quote we no longer need to be stimulating the economy unquote it is their job after all to keep inflation at bay\nThis has some on Wall street a little bit concerned as the long term effect of higher interest rates and the potential economic slowdown are still unknown\nAnd when there's a little uncertainty out there Wall Street starts to move in a big way now what does that mean for your money and your retirement\nWell definitely it means more uncertainty if you only rely on what Wall Street provides and here at Mayfield financial we think that is no way to plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent\nSo we think that is no way to plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nRetirement planning requires a careful thought process that involved many different moving pieces one of those is Social Security another could be a pension and for some of the biggest piece is your retirement savings\nAnd when it comes to your retirement savings today baby boomers had been found to hold more stock market type investments than ever before\nPerhaps that's due to the lower returns sometimes seen in more of the fixed income type mutual funds on Wall street and it's also the result of this ten year bull market run\nHowever most financial advisors would agree you shouldn't have too much exposure to Wall Street or you're setting yourself up for potential failure what if another two thousand eight crisis hits us or worse\nThe drop in two thousand eight was so severe and so sudden most financial models didn't even fathom that kind of a loss retirement accounts across the country were decimated savings plans dash withdrawals put on hold income reduced\nWhy would we want to put ourselves through something like that again\nNow you've probably heard the saying before which some attribute to Albert Einstein but who really knows\nBut the saying is insanity is doing the same thing twice expecting a different result so what do we think the right thing to do is well it's definitely you don't want to do the same thing twice and have too much exposure to the stock market\nSo our retirement planning process that Mayfield financial is a little bit different\nFor starters it's one that doesn't entirely rely on Wall street we've got to get it through our heads that Wall Street isn't the only place to keep our money growing there are much safer alternatives out there\nAnd even with that safety still have the potential to keep growing\nThis is what we call a safe money plan here at Mayfield financial it's an account set up and your name it could\nBe an IRA or raw firing a roll over IRA and inherited IRA or a four\nOh one K. or even just regular saving money and in that account you can receive certain guarantees certain protections that even in the worst stock market you won't lose a dime\nSo that's why here at Mayfield financial and the state protection services we feel that what we do is so important we help our clients right here in southern Arizona takes some of the wall street risk out of their portfolio\nWe do this using our expertise in safe money planning and create a customized plan for you\nOr at least a part of your portfolio is one hundred percent protected from Wall street risk\nSo if this sounds interesting to you and you'd like to

a game so don't put your entire nest egg at risk in this\nHigher meant your life it's much more important than just a game so don't put your entire nest egg at risk in the stock market\nThere's so many risks from all sorts of different avenues especially right now there are so many economic ... out there and talk of a slowdown we're seeing action on tariffs and trade wars and rising interest rates\nEven major investment from some of them are telling their clients to get out of the market and that we are quote in the last hurrah of the market I don't care what you think about what's going on in the White House or how the media is portraying everything when it comes down to it\nThe economy and Wall Street are going to do what it does on its own\nEconomies are cyclical it's always been that way and it always will and the fact is right now we're seeing signs that were near are already at the top\nAlan Greenspan put it best when during the dot com bubble of the nineties he said he saw quote irrational exuberance\nNow maybe it hasn't reached that far maybe it has you'll be the judge so even if you have a Wall Street portfolio now but you feel like you're safe with your bond funds\nDon't fall into the false sense of security that you think you might have innate bond fund now I spent ten years as a Wall Street advisor and many advisors they don't talk about this but a bond fund or bond mutual fund or ATF\nThey all have the potential to lose principle value you may think that they are safe because it's in a bond but unfortunately it's a bond fund that managed by Wall Street\nAnd it trades and it moves that has a price and it's highly sensitive to interest rates so if rates are on the rise those bond fund values will go down and depending on how fast rates move\nYour principal value in that bond fund could decrease substantially faster than your funding yield in the last Twenty years or so we've been in a downward trend in interest rate environment\nTo where they almost went to zero in two thousand nine\nNow rates are on the rise and we have yet to ever experience in the history of Wall Street what kind of an effect long term rising rate have on bond funds so what do you do\nHere at Mayfield financial an estate protection services\nFor over twenty five years right here in Tucson we have been a safe money retirement adviser our primary objective for our clients\nIs to help them take a portion of their portfolio and turn it into a guaranteed safe investment one that has competitive upside potential\nEven if markets continue higher

worry free financial solutions I'm Nathan Federico a safe money retirement specialist in financial retirement planning there are two separate and distinct time periods in our lives the first is\nThe wealth building an earnings phase this is a time when we are working trying to save\nAnd it's a time when we contribute to things like for one case to IRAs and other retirement planning accounts and during this time the stock market is one of the most powerful tools on the planet and should be used heavily in this accumulation phase especially when you're younger there's absolutely no doubting that\nThe second phase in retirement planning is the part where we transition from wealth building to wealth spending the second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain\nAnd when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert assets into income\nAnd in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you were a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan and it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some called this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of him and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one pensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now\nMost of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement\nEspecially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives this is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four O. one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one k.'s and IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee of income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four O. one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey sailed right through the financial calamity of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they had the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety of principle and guarantees this is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial NSA protection services this is what\nThe security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial NSA protection services\nThis is what we call a safe money plan and we've been doing it here for over twenty five years\nAnd we believe and know that for at least they part of your portfolio your four one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income that you can count on year after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and ahead of inflation\nAre safe money plans do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four O. one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course raw IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive\nAll with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no commissions paid by you\nSo what do you need to do you need to take action now before it's too late take action while the stock market is near all time highs you need to take action now before the financial storms come and you know they will it's just a matter of when\nTo get more information on how a safe money plan could help protect your hard earned money and your four one K. and

and blasting away and a living the life that you see in a video game and a looks like the army's out to try and get some new warriors and they're really kind of presenting the activities of being in the military is as a super excited\n[laughter] yeah so so the military for a very very long time has talked about marketing to millennials a service that the next thing that they need to be doing\nAll

know you don't necessarily have a a particular bad guy to go after but you had this role to play which they're trying to run from promoters of being you know very desirable\n[noise] that's right and that's something I've heard a lot of military leaders say is that they've got a hundred percent success rate when it comes to predicting the next battle and that they've never been right not once

here\nWaiting for you here are basically internment camp chain link and the port a potty\nIll profit thing to get them back home [noise] yeah um whenever you've been promised isn't here\nHere's what they've been promised would they'd been promises that eh forget all the political rhetoric when you get here or here's the the crib sheet here's what you tell a border protection that you want political asylum and because you fear for your life\nAnd then you're thrown into the process and they they put you through the process and then they let you go and they give you a court date and then you never show up and it's a it's quite an arrangement or we've come to an end the last caravan that came in you remember the Democrats and the media but I repeat myself made all kinds of\nPolitical hay out of the separation of children which Obama did too and it was fine when he did it at ... night at American citizens overseas\n... kind of like a prince sold on a cell non rather\nBut he uh you know he he wasn't the bad guy for the double standards are really quite extraordinary but in any event the last ... came in and because of the Democrats and their friends in the media made a whole lot of family separation thing into a political issue and they had the pictures from the Obama administration of children's sleeping in cages\nAnd they claimed that they were from the Trump Administration because they lie all the time\nI'm the president was forced by the court of public opinion because of public pressure and political pressure and media pressure\nTo basically allow the last care about it and that that message that reality was not lost on this caravan and Luis the guy who was audio I'm going to play in a little bit he said\nYeah President Trump says he's going to close the border but last time they open it up at everybody got in and that's the lesson so now let's go again and if these seven ... seven thousand two hundred and now they're still have to go all the way through

to blue Flaco ponders now I'm just a little bit curious if you're\nSaid that his security forces have captured almost one hundred ISIS terrorists\nIt's Thursday said that his security forces have captured almost one hundred ISIS terrorists in Guatemala that's what he said\nPresident says ... had captured quote close to one hundred people completely linked to terrorist issues with ISIS and that not only have we arrested them within our territory\nBut they have been deported to their countries of origin St Guatemala they'll deport dress in a heartbeat [laughter]\nSo should we have the same immigration policies that Guatemala have I think perhaps we should President Trump's so he's under President Trump also mentioned I'm a possible is one of those elements and all that Democrats don't care that's ... ... what do they care President Trump\nThink there are wonderful people you got some bad people and those groups you got some tough people in those goods and I'll tell you what this country doesn't want them\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThat's a a new twist on an old theme there it's a a America's the land of immigrants the land of refugees I'm all in favor of all of that I really am\nI genuinely and sincerely am I my my building I live in a building in Washington DC I live in Washington DC and I live in a building or Washington DC and my building is like the United nations\nThat are ... eleven languages spoken on my elevator over the weekend a with me in it at a in my building and my neighborhood forget about it and and uh and that's great I think that's wonderful\nBut we have immigration laws wherever system for immigration and it isn't let's get thousands of people with foreign flags in March up and we have a list of demands because that's not going to work you know we might have to let the Democrats loose on 'em with fire hoses and dogs\nAre they they they don't do that anymore or they just do that when somebody wants to exercise their right to free speech things like that Fox News center reporter William a larger ness down to the border between may call and go walk them a lot\nOf Honduras has the highest murder rate in the world Honduras has the highest homicide rate in the world outside the door\nHas the fourth highest murder rate in the world go off my law has the I I Do that kind of like ... um has the fifth highest homicide rate in the world you should probably um work on that\nShould see what you can do about that to decrease the homicide rate just see Tallahassee also you know Gillum is his name right the Democrat running for a Senate in or for governor rather in uh in Florida\nAnd um hid under his watch under his to twitch under his leadership Tallahassee now has a the highest murder rates\nIn the states and they've they've shattered the record for for Tallahassee um and and I guess that's a point of pride or\nSomething um [noise] but if you're a Democrat it's not really a big story or I suppose because\nYou get promoted it's like round the manual it's like broccoli ... organized the south side of Chicago good job there and I was elected to the Senate from the state house the U.S Senate from the state house in Illinois and then the president the United states because he fixed the south side of Chicago which is like\nAleppo right what's Aleppo\nOr let's go to William ... done along the ...\nWhich is like Aleppo right what's Aleppo or let's go to William ... done along the\nBorder and um it it's true though this Gillum guy at the the the homicide rate in Tallahassee has shattered all records and that's not even something that reflects on him at\nAll why why would that be a problem\nHere Democrat it's really not a problem All right let's go because William watching us with Fox News yesterday I was watching this live yesterday afternoon and William ... was speaking to one of the organizers of the caravan\n[noise] his name he said was Luis and Louis was wearing a vast like he's a crossing guard you know as with the reflective orange stuff on the vest and\nWilliam ... spoke to him because he was at a designated as a spokesman and one of the organizers of the thing and I said what you know when these people get to the United states what what did these people want why are they fleeing their homes in Central America what are these people going to say when they get the United\nStates [laughter] probably all say something I don't know they were probably ask [laughter] they they get into something they can say I mean I have all the kids they can go to school so they can apartment and they can go to work\n[noise] so they can get but their their kids aren't with them so they want to bring their kids and after they get here 'cause it's mostly adult men\nThat are that are coming in but I didn't hear him say anything about a living in fear about uh the crime the gangs the the cartels I didn't hear anything about that it probably has to give them something\nSo they can have stuff so they can stay so they can get an apartment so they can get a job so their kids can go to school\nYeah All right well okay\nI understand that I I genuinely do I understand that and for that we have something that we call the immigration system\nAnd you go to the embassy in your country and you apply\nAnd you know now let me let me ask you this sort of any half wedded live out their\nLet's say somebody gets on an airplane in Aleppo and flies to Cairo and then flies to London and then flies to New York and gets off the plane and says I'm here to stay I Want to live here I I I got on a plane and I came to the United states because now I'm here and\nI'm not leaving\nIs that how our immigration system works is that our immigration system should work is that how the immigration system of any country works or should work\nThe answer is obviously know Luis\nWas asked by William logic us they said well look the president said he's going to ah\nHe's going to shut down the border as you\nBring this caravan up toward the United states the president said he may call it the military and he's going to shut down the border but listen Louis knows she paid attention last time around the Democrats ginned up that whole fake news story completely fake huge lie that's like the red solo cups story\nThat Trump\nOf a zero tolerance policy in a part of that was true separating families like never before none of that was true Obama separated them all the pictures that they use word from the Obama administration\nBut listen Louis learn and then because of the media slash Democrat but I repeat myself pressure or the president was forced to basically let the caravan and they were process\nSo the media slash Democrat but I repeat myself pressure or the president was forced to basically let the caravan and they were processed\nThey were let loose in the country catch and release because the Democrats were and their allies in the media were able to manipulate public opinion with fake pictures they're real pictures but they were from Obama putting children and cages and Obama literally did turn people over to caregivers\nSome of whom used them as slave labor including sex slave\nLabor children handed over by Obama personally\nJust getting it wasn't personally but it was his administration if it were Trump handing kids over to people that use them as slaves on a chicken ranch in Ohio which is what happened during Obama\nWith kids living in a in a chicken shack with a bucket as a bathroom because the Obama people handed him over to the flavors\nAnd there are literally slave labor\nIn Ohio the children that were handed over by Obama and that story just got nothing\nNothing because I don't care about children they don't care about human life they don't care about slavery in our care about the sexual abuse of children and their documented cases of the Obama people handing children over\nTo people who are not their guardians who than uh the cereal a sexually abused them but you know let's not get all caught up in that ... was watching the news and he knows last time around President Trump said he wasn't going to let them in but then they got him so what'd Lewis said yesterday\nHe had that last ... last time and we we take over there but he opened the border fool them all and then people will say voter yeah Neal radio in the United states\nSee he said that last time but he opened the border for them and all the people that went up there already in the United states so this is a success story for the Democrats below sea and Schumer high fiving in front of the TV when they're sitting there watching Fox News yesterday and ah\nAnd then Louis said well I mean you know it's an and William lodging assassin so if you're an important if you get turned back then what\nHave they do and back they throw it away they send them back our country we come back\nWe're coming back we're just come back well you know I'm [laughter]\n[laughter] that's not acceptable and then once again just in case it wasn't clear enough what are you coming for coming because you're fleeing the horrors of ah go up a model\nOr why are you coming\nBy these guys going for work [noise] well yeah we will find a job so we can help our ... our family on bringing some food and medicine or some other stuff that we need the feminine eat", "show_name": "no_show", "year":

they used acid\nOr you know old so they called in the wool fake called in Harvey ... tell and they created the s a bad thing to do away with the ah the parts and there's a story also that the Saudis the team recorded it\nWhich would be pretty gruesome too but perhaps to show to whoever it is that sent them to be satisfied it reminds me of one of the attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler\nOr one of the unfortunately unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler the the the ... the conspiratorial were rounded up and they were executed as you might expect some were allowed to commit suicide in certain cases but they executed the number of the conspirators\nAnd Adolf Hitler couldn't be present for at least a couple of the executions so they filmed the executions for them so that he could see them later at least a couple where they hang up or Hitler's enemies with piano wire\nAnd Hitler wanted to watch the films of this so is print psalm on the the uh the culprit here behind the

prince in Saudi Arabia by whatever means necessary\nSo I just wouldn't go round counting all your chickens and leaping to conclusions as to whether a the crown prince is behind us not to defend the

over everything aren't they aren't they something to behold they distract themselves and then they accused the president of trying to distract them by sending out a tweet because he's never sends out tweets unless he wants to distract them\nAnd I don't know what they want to be distracted from this time but it turns out they're very easily distracted I got some advice for the news media who keep complaining about the president distracting them some being so easily distracted it's a matter of the people what are your cats playing with a ball of yarn when\nJoe Biden walks into the room with a pencil laser and starts making your chase it around the what's the matter with you people if you're so easily distracted\nUm that's your fault it's your problem and you should stop your whining but they love their whining don't they they love wanting their big Weiner's their Weiner's from way back\nThere are so many things going on today President Trump did an interview with the Associated Press any dared compare the Saudi situation to Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing and they did so correctly and\nAccurately and rightly or but that didn't keep the press from having a little bit of a his he fit\nGoing into it too easy I think they're in a bit of it 'cause he\nHowever that said there are a lot of remarkable things going on oh and we have posted I talked I talked about the article last week and I mentioned it also earlier the piece from the American spectator by John are Bradley\nWhat the media orange telling you about ... the dissidents fate says a lot about Saudi Arabia and the rise of the mobsters state\nAgain talked about this uh this piece last week but it's full of interesting information about this particular show gay and his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood to Osama bin Laden himself\nHave a great deal of interest in publishing the ground truth\nBut who are we to a judge their culture\nAnd compare their culture to our culture their culture is just as legitimate as ours is this is what the left has been telling us for many decades now for many many decades\nAnd and that's a the ... of course until it's not\nAnd and that's the standard protocol with these guys because that's the way that they are\nSo the news media's pushing the president over Iraq and say well we know what happened the news media always knows what happened they they know that with Brett Kavanaugh he gave those girls quite loads and Nineteen eighty something and then they stood outside the door waiting in line for gang rape pulling the train on teenage girls\nA with braces and thick glasses because that's what happened to the news media said that's what happened here it is this is this is it and uh you know so these are not the best people to put in charge of judging whether something passes muster whether the facts have come together or not but they want the president to overreact and\nIt looks like the president is actually\nA struck a pretty good balance the news media doesn't approve but\nThey don't approve of the sun coming up in the age of Donald Trump in the White House so I wouldn't worry about that too much but I'll get to the news media people and some of the commentary on this because it's pretty crazy pretty crazy\nHey if you or someone that you know gets leg cramps or foot cramps you know how painful and disruptive they can be muscle cramps can ... short of a sound sleep and the middle of the night or interrupt your daily life\nWell listen carefully because I recently learned about Sarah works relief era where it's really if it was a non greasy

strong labor markets and financial system\nNow that's good news and the only period that we took off from that ranking was the years wherever rock Obama was president United States already had a recession to deal with and it was the worst recession since the last big recession\nIn the depression which was a you know there we go and that was a recovering the FDR recovery which never happened there was no FDR recovery so we've got that going for us now\nGet a load of this from mark it watch used to belong to CBS I think they sold\nUs job openings hit a record seven point one million exceeding number of unemployed Americans what's that we have more job openings than we have unemployed people yes that's exactly right\nFurther more as Jeffrey ... cash at marketwatch writes Americans are quitting their jobs at fastest pace in Seventeen years\nNow you'd say well what does that have to do with any\nWhy would people quitting their jobs to be a positive indicator it's a very positive\nBecause they're confident that they can go get another job\nIf you're afraid that if you lose your job you can't get another job then you hold on to your job like it's a life raft because you want to keep the electricity on because little Timmy is going to need some porridge in the bowl and at Christmas Time he's going to need GI Joe with kung fu grip\nIt's another Eddie Murphy reference and and [laughter]\nAnd ah so people hold on to their jobs but in a very strong economy people say\nScrew this job take this job and shut up I can go get another job and you know what that means that means employers are going to look more fondly upon their employees are as Democrats call us workers and they're going to say well we can't afford to lose people in this job market we might lose people\nSo we're going to have to be more generous [noise] the number of job openings\nIn the United states rose slightly to our record\nSeven point one for a million in August reflecting strong growth for the economy and the best labor market in decades oh this is not the White House putting up this press release this was marketwatch not a conservative outlet\nJob openings top seven million in July for the first time ever\nLet me just pause there for a second\nRevised figures show and they increased again in August President Trump was quick to tell the record level of job openings\nThough he actually cited a lower number so even money or you know it's got hit they got it wrong or you got it wrong because there are more job openings than he said the jobs still waiting to be filled meanwhile easily exceeded the number of people officially classified as unemployed\nThe government previously said six point two or three million people unemployed in August job openings topped the number of unemployed for the first time in march based on government records going back to two thousand\nThe gap has now widened to a record nine hundred thousand you're the word record here again and again and again\nThe economy is that in ... it is booming it is going wild and the news media isn't going to tell you about it because it's good news for Trump and Republicans in their mid term elections coming up\nAnd they want to make sure that the Democrats do as well as the media can make the Democrats do so they're not going to talk about how great the economy isn't how everything's booming and how many records are being set all over the place on the economy here's another\nOne oh and ... also yeah given my this is your you remember that the Democrats and you have the ... thing right now the ...\nWhen they were a bum rushing Obamacare through on a strict party line in the middle of the night on a holiday weekend oh what a shame that whole thing was the news media loved it there are very very corrupt Nancy Pelosi was out there saying that Obamacare\nObamacare would liberate you from your job you wouldn't have to be tied to your job you could go out and become a poet or a harmonica player on the street corner and realize you're a lifelong dream of being a nothing nobody\nA useless ... lying on the tax payer teach which is what Democrats love they want more of those because those are all democratic voters Nancy Pelosi\nWas the entrepreneur oil bill it's yellow that fast someone if you want to entrepreneurial from being the fishing or what\nFocus on your parents are stealing a passing aspiration that he was home health care and you don't have to be job ...\nJob block to you're going to have to be job blocked a even play the do grow on a street corner and everyone will love you the world will be the path to your a homeless shelter in the store front of an abandoned [noise]\nUh I Know the reality is that President Trump forget about this left wing economic stuff and you get a a it's an entrepreneurial bill because other people are paying for your health care and\nYou're getting subsidized by people that go to work so you can play the Jews harp on the corner I was like the Jews are what's with that is just so they call it ... and\nUh and that's what the Democrats were going for with Obamacare apparently that didn't work very well and uh hey what did what did your health insurance go up to 'em what a disgrace but now a Donald Trump's economic plans have actually created a situation where many many millions and millions of people are not\nJob blocked job blocked it's a you know is that ... that job blocked or [laughter] dental damn I don't know what they're they're ... job blocked nobody's job blocked a about Obamacare was going to liberate us from being job lock and now the reality is the Democrats in Obamacare\nDidn't liberate anyone from being job blocked it just redistributed wealth and stole from one group of people to give to another group of people like a criminal Robin Hood fakes a so they can buy votes of stupid people who want free stuff and ah you know it's the opposite of an entrepreneurial bill but that's what they say that you don't have to be job law\nNo job locked well millions and millions of Americans thanks to President Trump\nAnd again the timeline is two thousand eight that we were no longer the most competitive and now we are again what changed\nWhat what'd you say we were the most competitive under George W Bush than we had that Wall Street thing and then Obama became president and way we're not the most competitive and now we are again what what do you think that is I Can't imagine\nThere's another one the Reuters news agency out of Chicago Illinois United States steel corporation you know US Steel perhaps you've heard of the\nWorkers they call them workers United states steel workers it is the United steelworkers union after all\nAre set to get

were frozen in the last contract which ended September first as the Pittsburgh based company was suffering losses from a slump and the domestic steel domestic steel prices so here is the uh\nAnd uh they're thrilled and it's great and all the stuff that the news media told you about how it was going to lead to a terrible results and there would be no ... and the terrorists would be bad for everybody and they lose their jobs all be us you can go back you can look at the story's what the Democrats and\nThe news media but I repeat myself were saying about President Trump's approach to

us\nRepresentative can impact a local businesses among her constituency\nI mean that that's my background is you know running our Hispanic Chamber and\nSo much of what Congress impacts are done are small business tax reform the tax policy act that recently was passed\nA has been a great cause for businesses and both large and small it's been an opportunity to put more dollars in the pocket of our employees that they were able to buy the show's quip meant I mean you see the economy now just on such an uh an upright it's wonderful we want to continue that\nI'm from that want to continue that effort to really have progress mhm and that's why it's important to keep I think our house majority and to keep this seat in the hands of someone who is pro business Republicans\n... well it seems like Tucson is doing a pretty good job of getting in the or a good way of some of these big companies out there they've noticed is\nYeah I mean I think business attraction is something that he sounds really done well lately UC caterpillar has come in and so many different Amazon logistics center going in Ghana cobra road there's some great momentum going I Want to continue that great\nWell there's some concern out there among Arizona's a notably about health care and there's also some rattling going on in Washington about Medicare and Social Security and ah you know some of the other kinds of issues that are some of the resources and programs that are Americans use pay into uh what about defending\nYeah and uh you know some of the other kinds of issues that are some of the resources programs that are Americans use pay into uh what about defending those kinds of resources for people in southern Arizona\nAbsolutely I think making sure that those that have paid into Social Security does does it promises they've been made and it it's vitally important that they're kept\nOn my own parents aren't Social Security and Medicare ... but you're right that's a lot of the conversation that we're having we're also talking more broadly about the Affordable CARE Act in how that really hasn't worked in Arizona we need to improve and better\nThat process especially for individuals and small businesses as a chamber president I can tell you and most of our members did not ... can't afford to provide any kind of insurance um so we need to improve that uh for the CARE Act\nMhm how's your just\n[laughter] it's coming along I nonstop knocking on doors raising money to keep the TV commercials going and being outraged by my opponent but as many people know she moved here from flags after Tucson to try to take the seat\nAnd interesting dollars from New York and California and Nancy Pelosi and others and it's challenging I'm the local candidate I've grown up here more than forty years a served on many boards and running our our chamber of commerce the Hispanic Chamber for the last nine years\nSo it's kind of definitely local versus outsiders I Would say um but working hard at at least got Nineteen days to go and and I went up when they see it is going to be much like Martha's first race where she won by just a couple of hundred votes\nUm you know it the the most important piece is really that everyone has to get out there and vote with so important to really keep the momentum that great momentum we're seeing in Arizona and in southern Arizona\nNo I haven't seen anybody on the on on any ballot anywhere that we've been talking to so far this season hasn't really pointed the importance of getting out they had voted is absolutely critical and I think a president's made that a\nRather clear a in terms of national support do what about the Republican National committee or what's their disposition towards your race or did they think it's going to be as big a squeaker in early treatment like that\n[laughter] they are it is is considered one of the top five most competitive races in the country right here in the city to in southern Arizona though the Republican National committee has been\nVery supportive we just had the chairwoman come out for me in and talked to folks about how important is to vote and hosts a fundraiser which is wonderful\nA independent groups have come in and come out of the race which is tough um but still hoping to look for support from their mothers that might want engage in the race and helped me get across the finish line but the Republican National and he's been very supportive\nAll right we're Marquez Peterson she's running to replace Martha McSally in Arizona's second congressional district and she joined us on two sons

them whether or not genetically they actually have a staffordshire terrier in them remains to be seen but this very blocking look\nWith a very large head very muscular body sometimes it can be rather short and stout\nUh it seems to be a common theme especially in southern Arizona that he had the other southern states\nAre where these dogs used to be bred for inappropriate purposes and now they're being bred more for pet purposes or accidental proceedings and so now we have quite a few of them out here [noise] um so they're almost kind of the unofficial\nData point [laughter] that's an interesting uh we we we uh look at the other dogs seem to be kind of stock and bulky like that some of those a Labrador is can be big bloc heads\nThey really can and it depends again on what genetic line there from uh if they're more of a field hunting dogs they're not going to be these tall skinny lanky dog out there to be able to chase\nYeah All right and what's a wolf dog I you know like
