purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments that Quicken Loans we created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nOr to um be on the verge of defeating the ... in combat but we still have a week to go he joins us now uh it's good to have you on Mr Morsi how are you\nI'm doing great Laura thanks for having me on your program today\nAbsolutely a let's talk about the effort to blame this president his rhetoric his language for this horrific attack on the synagogue\n[noise] well I I think this is just another example of what we've been seeing all fall you have a resistance obstruction impeachment caucus that's\nBasically on Capitol Hill and the house and in the Senate and you have Hillary Clinton who says she's in capable of civility you have all these radicals\nThat they're only goal is to bring this president down and they're going to take the most outrageous positions whatever Trump says\nThey're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and you have to have respect for this president\nWho has done so much to restore American credibility aboard if you look at Israel this is a president that it's been a staunch ally of Israel and actually had\nThe guts to go and follow through to make Jerusalem the capital in terms of locating the embassy this was huge but\nThey will find any way to pick at President Trump\nFortunately in West Virginia President Trump has a lot of support he won the election by forty two points\nWhen I get elected I'm going to be a conservative fighter for President Trump's agenda\nAnd separately the reason why people are fleeing from Joe ...\nIs he's another dishonest Washington liberal he's open borders he supports these radical leaders Chuck Schumer would be as first vote in the Senate and West Virginians are very concerned about returning to the Clinton Obama years and that's why we're going to win this race\nWhy um why would they Democrat ever have much of a chance in the state of West Virginia when Donald Trump won the state by what forty point something like that\n[noise] well forty two points and and I think the reason why the action is\nReally slipping dramatically in the polls is that as we've been able to get our message out and contrast to let them know what the people know that on all the issues that matter not only maps and some price of Hillary and Obama but ... is not pro life a mansion supports Planned Parenthood\nMansions supports radical gun control West Virginians don't like that and I think one of the worst\nThings of all is that Joe mansion doubled down his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work so Joe Manchin and the more people learn about his actual record\nNot his rhetoric because for what he does is he says one thing in West Virginia something completely different in Washington DC the more people learn about dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion they move away from them so it's an education process\nWhat about the um issues of just basic fairness that we saw a rise after the\nKavanaugh I'm hearing Joe Manchin a voted for cabin on the end but a man\nThat I think most people just saw that as just an example of rank unfairness and treating some time treating someone who is it 'cause he says you know they were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks following at home when you know the Joe mansion\nThey were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks following at home when you know the Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first called on the Senate floor mansion took a powder and\nIn fact he only came back the vote effort Susan Collins declared her position and whatever people think about the cabinet vote West Virginia should cast a vote there should be the leadership out of West Virginia so\nJoe Manchin could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for\nKavanaugh we know that Feinstein held that material for months why\nBecause she wanted to play politics with the Supreme Court nominee Joe mansion aided enough that it Feinstein and Schumer by waiting giving the maneuvering room I think that's the word they used that's what the problem is a guy like Joe mansion you know he may appear to be more moderate and rhetoric but in reality when\nYou're first vote is to empower these radicals then you can't be considered moderate he is a dishonest washing the liberal and more and more voters are learning that\nLet's talk about the economy in West Virginia the president decided early on that he was going to try to do what he could to reinvigorate the coal miners their way of life\nOr and yet he's ridiculed even today I Can't remember I saw it but just today for his comments about clean coal Patrick\n[noise] yeah I think many people realize that the president has really followed through on his promises to the people West Virginia let's start with coal as many people listening no I let that twenty seven state coalition to defeat Obama's coal killing rights\nAt the U.S Supreme Court but that that is served as a bridge to President Trump and then he fall through on his promises which were on some of those crazy unlawful rules and that's putting some miners backdoor now look we have a long way to go\nBut you're starting to see a lot more activity in the energy area and that's directly related to the optimism people have with the Trump presidency but it goes beyond that\nThe Trump tax cuts are very beneficial for West Virginia not only a doubling of the standard deduction and the lowering the rates but in West Virginia we have fifty five of these opportunities always which are going to allow impoverished communities to lift up and reach their potential that's huge and that's\nCredit to President Trump Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts and he\nKind of goes back and forth and say well he was open than he wasn't the reality is he voted no he voted the wrong way because Chuck Schumer wouldn't let them vote for it and that's not the kind of leadership ... but we are seeing\nA resurgence in West Virginia and you have to give this president credit for so many of the good things he's done on taxes on regulatory relief on picking rule of law judges that instills confidence in the system which allows\nA entrepreneur is to spend more of their capital\nOr we are going to be covering this race very closely over the next to seven days election day next week but you can vote early in West Virginia correct\nYes in fact ah October twenty fourth or early voting began swing hours people to go out to the polls if you need to learn about your early voting location go to Patrick or she dot com or vote that GOP and they'll take it to the right place\nA fantastic uh Patrick Morrisey again and the latest poll he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe

I'm a fan of I just can't watch these people anymore because they aren't entertaining Baron fundamental makes you laugh I don't get your Waverly they only Jimmy Fallon does uh last time I saw him anyway but I remember him apologizing for messing up the president's hair and I found that to be weird\nI found that to be odd so all of these people protected by guns including members of Congress and governors and mayors there are all out there talking smack as they're protected by good guys with guns\nSo I'm yet to hear a real solution from somebody in the lead look if you're on the left you have a solution and listen to\n... I'll say it again what I've said many times rock Obama in my lifetime was the worst president he may be the worst president in modern times Jimmy Carter is a close second Jimmy Carter who by the way still injecting herself in in uh in in news and in issues\nThere were bronco bomber was a horrible president\nRuined the economy divided us and the lines of race doesn't like how we got here hated colonialism\nJust complain does if slavery ended yesterday not a hundred and fifty years ago very strange what he did he did it with a smile and he did it is very cool it's like a rock stars that people found all over him and just didn't even pay any attention when he was doing he was a horrendous president\nBut I agreed with him when he was right I agree with him several times three or four times get bin Laden I agree with him kill bin Laden I Can't see it like if the if this president was the one that found bin Laden that he killed him\nTrust me or give you order to kill them trust me the left would say it was a horrible thing how dare he hates Muslims I'm telling you that's what they would do but when rock Obama did it I said well listen that was the right call call you had to make absolutely\nWhen rock Obama said let's cap CEO pay five hundred thousand dollars if you borrowed money for the taxpayers I agreed with him pay the tax payers\nBack first then pay your CEO whatever you want to pay him but if you borrow money from me you're not gonna give this guy ten million a year what are you stupid I agreed with him I thought that was smart I agreed with him when he said take out the pirates off the coast of Somalia that border American vessel I agreed with him\nAnd it's okay\nYou know you can agree with people that you generally speaking politically aligned with you can agree with them when they're right when rock Obama said marriage as between one man and one woman as he was running for president two thousand they agreed with him\nI did totally so listen and\nThat's all about a blind squirrel finding a nut I mean that's that's about him really taking the rights stance on a few different issues the rest of the time he was a radical that was trying to change the country from the inside out because he hated how we were founded\nSo when this president does the right thing like there's not a whole lot about blacks it today you know a black suit is Carrie\nYeah I've heard of that that yeah you're right and see anything in the news and that and\nMuch of black people went to the White House young black conservatives went to the White House to show that they are not going to be on the Democrat plantation anymore it's getting very little if any coverage in the news it was getting any coverage the coverage is a paddle a black folks complaining about how stupid they the other folks were for going to the White House\nThat's weird Alison camera on CNN when she was on Fox she wasn't this person knowing CNN she is actually asked um somebody from I guess the person who runs the synagogue the president's talking about possibly coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue which you welcome\nHim carry why would you ask that question would you welcome him and has not being a question I Would ask a little bit loaded no I mean you're looking for an answer their ... and his answer was absolutely he's my president why wouldn't they wanted to come here and ...\nA little bit loaded no I mean you're looking for any answer their ... and his answer was absolutely he's my president why would not want him to come here and that was the right answer but she expected he might say no he should stay away\nWell listen if even if you're on the far left and you're a Democrat who happens to be Jewish you know this presidents looked up for Israel you know this president has a history of working very well with and loving Jews so pretending like eat something other than that is stupid\nIt's just dumb he's the only president out of twelve and a promise that who really moved our embassy to Jerusalem the rifle capital of Israel\nGet Allison Kim around a thought that the rabbi at that synagogue would not want this guy at the synagogue\nBack so weird it's become now just asking that question tells me she's probably a member of the fake news media do own or do I want any harm to happen to her absolutely not do I want her to be called out for badly doing the job or purposely misleading sure we can do that went up\nSo the whole idea that you must know seize on this crisis says ... said never let a serious crisis go to waste you should seize on this crisis they make it all about Trump negative negative negative negative it was Trump\nLecture let's ignore that walk away that big get together happened in Washington is that the widely reported the walk away march ... there are a lot of people there Brennan struck was the guy but we had on here use the the founder of that of that whole movement and they had a great turnout not being covered by anybody\nSo is there fake news media you damn skippy when you ignore those things those positive things when you downplay the great economic numbers\nAnd then you get mad when somebody calls you up for missed reporting or being stupid get over yourself\nBut I really do want to hear some commonsense logical solutions to how we keep people safe for these soft targets and if the solution is not to have more good guys with guns fill me in on what I missing one eight eight eight nine four one packs Joe packs dot coms their\nSo called ...\nThere is nobody on the planet like use

I can imagine I Know this guy should be out of the job you should be shouted out of the\nOf the county and it should not be able to be an education a gym in fact if you don't mind it give us the story I won't be able to hear the story of a gym in our free made Republicans completely against this award obviously for good reason I'm ... but if you can do a little something something\n... this is from the Miami Herald and Broward superintendent Robert Runcie received an award for his courage and the aftermath of the summary fourteen school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High were Seventeen people were killed another Seventeen injured\nThe council of great city schools honored run the with the courage under crisis and war and its annual conference in Baltimore Thursday night the council tweeted the announcement which the ... school districts the Twitter account shared the courage you all exhibited after a tragedy and stand that you won't talk after to make sure schools become save is absolutely amazing between Rand\nLittle information available about the award on line Andrew Pollack the father of meadow Pollack who was among those killed in the shooting share the news in Nebraska or in school district to count\nAnd quote this we're going to Robert Runcie is reprehensible pollen gross\nHe has culpability and creating lenient policies and Broward schools that cultivate criminals like the one that murdered my daughter and they weren't should be given to one of the MSG teachers that paid the ultimate sacrifice school district handling of the shooting and the events leading up to it are the subject of several lawsuits in currently under investigation by a commission appointed by the governor\nIs nuts man is to to me it's just so stupid made after this this shooting in these innocent deaths even had some sort of a get together some dinner where he was touting the praises the promise program he lied about this guy not having been the promise for a reason why he wasn't in high school\nHe wasn't a problem for them and middle school was guy\nAnd they're doing this guy awards editor you sleep at night these Runcie I don't understand it it's weird to me it just really as we go back to the phone lines I appreciate you waiting let me say hello and welcome to line one is Cathy in golden valley Minnesota Cathy what's going on\nUm thanks for having me kill you bet good to be on the ...\nUm I have a a sort of the Democratic platform is basically free stuff for everyone right\nOr the ... the size of the socialist platform issue as\nWell yeah but so we had I was nominated for I Know a a project manager and principal planner for Minnesota the in our school and I was nominated for an governor's award\nFor a project that I did excellent and I had a meet and greet\nWe have the ceremony and the rotunda and meet and greet with Tina Smith after the party for cookies and coffee\nAnd apparently\nThey had taken the cookies which were normal size cookies cut them all in half\nAnd someone had taken the time to cut them all and half and by the time I got around to getting to the cookies there were no more cookies so I find it very ironic that the socialistic\nPlatform of you know here's free stuff yeah is that you know we're going to cut it in half and you may not get it or not but\nNow here's free stuff yeah is that you know we're going to cut it in half\nAnd you may not get it or not but anyways that's [laughter] that's kind of debate I irony I find it was that you know that the free they cut the cookies in hacks\nFirst of all it's a TV a stupid thing to do that that's going to make the second thing why not make enough cooking is one of the ... and a half\nWell they they bought the cookies from you know cover or something like that there are some group place but\nTo cut them in half and then not have enough to go around I find it very ironic that\nWell it's it's the most part of its luster of of how it doesn't work your kid take what they were they were hoping to everybody you should tell people don't mix or cookies but it's really that simple I mean we could all have cookies and we all do it makes them if we're all waiting for free cookies are going to get a half or noon or ... I think it's a great point\nNeed the media since Reagan did so in that respect us two very quiet\nIf he so chooses without the filter and the media doesn't need the media essentials like Reagan did so in that respect just two very quite different styles and say play themselves out\nThere it's very interesting comparison to make and you're absolutely right um I I might be missed remembering this ... and I think that's the word Brian Williams said it was I I may be missed remembering this but Ronald Reagan appear to me to do more press conferences more news conferences where he would actually take the questions from the media\nTrump will do you know sort of announcements and he'll walk out in in on the fly he'll take some questions Obama almost never took up the questions he be quite frankly even though the media was his buddy uh he he didn't want to sit there and be questioned by anybody\nWhy do you think Reagan did that is it because that was the only available way to get it out there and because of that is that why it appeared as though he had a friendly relationship would they Sam Donaldson even even though the same delta was always you know she's working at um were sniping at I\nI I think your analysis is pretty good I I'm Reagan hit the script almost almost because the cameras pointed out and we're not as all he had to work with me at a message out he couldn't speak directly to the American people uh you know I I find\nTrump as a you know they they you can tell they study the Reagan that are certainly and other previous presidents they use the helicopter track you know\nYeah you know he'll sometimes it can you hear a question he wants to hear and not here questioning doesn't want to hear but right off the road or a a helicopter on his way outside\nI I I think it's true or Trump has not held nearly as many press conferences that's Reagan right he as he certainly against this law much to the meeting on just about every given day is you know when they\nWhen they all we know swarm into his office he'll answer a few questions now and then some\nOf the ... the bottom line is is the way the media African in right in states\nIf you wanted to get your message out you had to have a right right and that Reagan would do in in this day and age you don't you know so Trump is creating its own rules and I don't blame 'em forties just using technology to his great advance\nIt's John Hi Bush the executive director of Ronald Reagan presidential a foundation and Institute but it's interesting that you say that Trump is on television every day\nEvery single day and it's a new video soundbite a new video clip every single day or you're taking long form you know rallies rig\nI don't remember even doing any of these sort of rallies where he would show up in five ten Fifteen thousand people would be there he didn't do it from the White House where he did it from you know his ranch in and he would do the media there their piece every day I'm biggies that\nExponentially different to did Reagan do a lot of his campaigning like Trump is doing\nWell on a dirt campaign years right as Nineteen eighty porous reelect just like his initial election GO Campaign and boy did really well run a campaign that's no doubt about it but there again where I think Trump spin very inventor he's has actually said well kept with the old rules\nHe just never stopped campaigning for my mom when he announced to the President's Day and I don't think he's ever going to stop the way Donald Trump looks like it if you want to win reelection you better campaign from the White House we're from wherever you are every day a week\nAnd I think that if you want to tell your own praises in your own accomplishments you have to do it this way he knows the media cameras will be trained on him but he knows in a press conference in and I'm actually asking a question here I'm guessing he knows in a press conference he won't necessarily be able to tell his own praises is that what's happening\nLet's actually sell but I you know I think he's figure it out it's not against the law that campaign early you know so he's just inventing a whole new way to\nYou know to put himself from the American people a lot I don't I you know I ... I think whether I'm sure there are styles in the future for different presidents won't be radically different\nThey're probably going to pick right up words prop left off because a lot of boating\nThe ANC whether I'm sure there are styles in the future for different presidents will be radically different they're probably going to pick right up words prop left off because a lot of what he does actually works bullets\nInteresting it was John Hi Bush he is the executive director of the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute what's interesting to watch is thirty thirty five years later Ronald Reagan is praised by both sides\nAnd the media doesn't necessarily ever say anything negative about um this guy I don't think a hundred years from now the ... going to see anything good about them so it it's almost like a Reagan walked slowly carrying a big stick it out a big smile worst Trump just gets in your face is that in in your opinion is that'd\nBe the stark difference between the two because when you look at accomplishments like you said they're almost exactly the same\nYeah it's a it's a fascinating question you post because I I think about that every day I Trump is not such a bright white light yeah at the relationship so intense that I too cannot imagine twenty thirty forty years from now somehow\nThat dates media looking back you know and listen dear mentors tourist Donald Trump in residency fashionable but also say during the ranking takes\nYou never thought it would have been imaginable either a you know or they may not a bad ass as soon as intensely war with each other not not at all but Reagan was the target of the liberal press every day he was an office there is no doubt about it and\nIt's only really because of his remarkable successes but as you look back and I'm In history the facts are facts are stubborn things and and people not look at the Reagan presidency and they have to give a damn what side of the fence that you might be our\nGuide reviews John Hi Bush executive director the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute I'm I Wonder if you have an opinion on this and all of anybody's ask you this before but\nWhat was Ronald Reagan's um relationship with the media going in Donald Trump for forty years was a media darling in New York LA Washington everywhere they loved him because he met money they put him on people would watch the show\nAnd they put 'em on people would advertise on the show this yeah this relationship went downhill in a matter of three years that's all we're talking about here three years ago\nRight before he announced he was still let me do you darling was Ronald\nReagan in good with the media before he ran or ... I I get the feeling that he was\nThey were actually he was it was really hot yeah yeah you know I mean you got to remember\nReagan as started off as an outsider even with his own party they ever on many many thought he was way too far to the right so but at the end you have to remember to want to wait for Reagan's first election he was down to Jimmy Carter by ten points you know it was not certain that he would when\nAnd when he came to office the press you know he was this is Amy of Don ... he was you know right wing not\nEverybody I learned about bedtime her bedtime for bombs or whatever it might have a headline everywhere right\nAbsolutely and that you know they make fun of writing and saying I can only speak if he was speaking off of three by five car and you know it wasn't smart wasn't well read it was that was absolutely not the truth and I think as Reagan continue to perform\nIn like Trump succeed and achieve his goals are they they ... they had to change their mind about Reagan I think by the time he got into a second term\nThey started to understanding what they had the front of them already saw reading him for his successor was but it really did take you know you know darn near or one or two more presidency's before the press release started the ...\nKind of amazing or a last question I appreciate the time John I'm ... how does how does Trump either a repairing this relationship where do you see them going forward just doing exactly which worked so far because I mean frankly the media might say that he's uh\nOthers Trump either a repair this relationship where do you see them going forward just doing exactly which worked so far because I mean frankly the media might say that he's a failure he's horrible and he's or something of ... and something else but the bottom line is these crowds\nOf a hundred thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere ... what do you see him doing going forward\nAnd if we use the word repair I don't think that's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that's necessarily now within his control\nI don't think even if they walk up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing hog the press is not going to happen and and that's because it's interesting it it's not too tough to imagine that Trump has an individual made a decision\nTo go to war with the media but but now that\nThe media has made the decision to go to war with Trump yeah that's a very different thing I don't think the media and I I think they kind of a\nNa you know that the ... now and and now they're they're they're in an enemy and campaigned against him no matter what I don't think there's a truce that's on the horizon ever and I think that's gonna be the case and so the\nTill ... hops

of tells you what's going on\nI'm currently in Georgia but normally I'm listening to W. came out of Kalamazoo\nOh beautiful given Kalamazoo what's going on well I was calling also about the um tax cuts [laughter] okay um well\nThe mainstream media has this very interesting way of twisting thanks so technically there is a demographic that is not\nThe benefit of tax cuts so if you've got ... you could do this and two minutes later on at your own convenience since you got to ask dot Gov fill out the ten forty put\n'em got married filing jointly with three kids put in fifty thousand for adjusted gross income do the math exemptions deductions you can't get a tax cut because you have no federal tax liability\nThis is the thing I get into a mainstream and wall and social networks and everything I mean I get into big fights the Turks some\nEverywhere I tell them you know the people that aren't getting a tax cut can't get a tax\nCut because they weren't paying literally correct\n... although I mean it but if you look at it for the Democrat way if you didn't get the tax cuts you could have given them more earned income credits or some crap whether you could have given them money back even though they never paid anything in I mean you're right it was real and what what what I said was anybody who's paying income taxes got a tax cut\nThose people who didn't get one that you're talking about weren't paying them so my statement dusting world\nOh of course yes I'm saying that's the ... the ... you know that that's what the liberal media is putting out there saying oh the poor people are just getting taken advantage of all not through all the talking about you don't pay tax right\nRight so he goes oh so it's a it's a it's a species arguing and they know that I've got a quick story by about ... and I I called them sink I guess it's ... or something I don't know\nBut I was at CNN about ten years ago eleven years ago they were trying to see if we can get an a left right show going and they had me going up against the air with Michael dice shouldn't be up and goes Roland Martin me up against Rachel Maddow was one of the people\nAnd then it was me and this this sink under guy\nAnd first of all he's about a foot shorter than I was which I found to be out and I think they had them standing on a box\nAnd and and as soon as they still they sort of said already here we go you know I read whatever's on the teleprompter and then we're supposed to argue or debate about the topic\nAnd this is again you know and and and I'm tired of this stuff and this is a bunch of garbage what do you think of it that he went\nHe yelled at me the whole time it was the weirdest thing and I looked at the guy he said what are you doing because I knew that we were actually trying to get a job you know which would have been sort of a cool back and forth to cause they got rid of cross fire a long time ago but they were considering bringing something like that back\nAnd and I and I looked at him I just looked right after they said they would stop yelling at me this doesn't make any sense and I think it was actually about Obama and the birth certificate and he said that no Republican has ever been questioned about his citizenship or his right to run and they said Oh yes John McCain was\nThe regular folks are underestimated because we can weigh both sides and we can make the decision of what's right and watch wrong and it'll come down to it no matter what they say in the end it's the voter\nAnd I am I I I agree with you but I don't look the people you're giving them too much credit I think people like you and me we we certainly get it but you know there are a lot of people out there that don't get a don't want to get it on trying to get it and we'll be ignorant effects even when you're handling them\n[noise] yeah like you know what history will say and let it be sad that our people you know\nGet the right thing which is go but I Know where everyone\nShould go to does voting polls and vote and we should decide what's right what's wrong but overall I think we should support our good president\nI'm with you a job that you get everything you wanted to get out because I've got to do something Oh yes ...\nAnd Martin leaning tower off now what's that one of those on your rights when you're talking [laughter] and I'm like oh let me ask you this\nCarry those will be my getting soft or general deserve it because normally she says you are ... love carry and then I'm going to just ... you don't mind raw she held on for an hour is over\n... yes as you said yeah she had a lot to say so you\nDid a good thing with Carol ... told me I should feel bad you've read as you should\nYou should veterans say it's called the week it kinda hungry as long as it is to have a backup you know I'd love to just like going back to the phone lines is going to be a line for fire was going to be Terry who's in College Station Terry talked to me what's going on\nWell I'm Glad to your show again high uh I'll tell you that was running across\nGoing on well\nUh Hi I'm Glad to your show again by a ... put it that said that was running across I ran across a a a website called the cut it never heard of the cut okay well I'm reading\nThat and evidently there's a lady she used to be a she was on a Fox\nShe's a political commentator and a former congressional press secretary anyway she was evidently ah after she was on Fox News it says in this article that she uh was contacted by that God that\nStood out the bombs he used his middle name or what she did was he make threats towards her and she reported it to Twitter he ended up like on a couple of her account and posted her a ... threat so she reported it to Twitter and a\nShow where he had gotten her picture and then set all this stuff to her and a Twitter she complained of them that she thought he was fine with it and\nIt has to do nothing about it\nYeah they didn't rise to the level of uh like\nHe was dangerous of abuse their views and the evidently there were some outcry over it but uh anyway I Would look over at that if you\nWill jury I think I think the Jerry earlier said dirt and use it but there were some ... I did yeah when I was hearing person that is yes I Believe she said at the same person you know she\nYeah she tweeted just a yesterday she said well wait a minute she said hey quarter the guy that you are ah that I report and guess what he's saying here is hey where to remember when I reported the guy who was making threats towards me\nAfter my peers on Fox News and you got sent me the U.S response on how you didn't think it was serious we'll get to the guy is and then the bombs he is forgot and then the bombs to the high profile\nWell how would you how would you oppose the bill yesterday they just arrested him today she actually said it before the rest of them\nKnow it was six forty five that she posted that\nTo though it was so ... okay so was this morning or worse than I\nKnow it's tonight\nOkay or don't you yeah I thought you said yesterday okay we'll Jerry I hear you and I appreciate you carry it was on his earlier so you'd be around these you know I think yeah I appreciate that it's on top of that I mean really we give your own for the abs\nAnd because you have to admit to you were right you know what I mean [laughter] come on who's going to be some more reasons than that right the ...\n... ... C I thought it was in a low carb diet if you'd be having to talk with voice [laughter] okay everybody on the editing nine four one package editing nine four one Seventy two four seven Charles is you know Massachusetts Charles what's going on I\nWrite I Am just a for a for a hot I just wanted to ask that I I just feel are going to vote straight conservative a ticket as much as you can in the state but as I told your screener earlier there's not a single Republican a representative in the state of Massachusetts and the two senators\nAre quite a good or a Democrat and I'm just I'm just concerned that a ... with one might pull it off I mean I don't know I mean I I Know that you interviewed a Jeff deal but I I just I just wanted to get you what your feelings on on on first of all I'm afraid that\nThis uh situation with ... or ... or you know people might forget it I don't forget it certainly and ah I think that uh it was\nThis uh situation with ... you know people might forget it I don't forget it certainly and I think that day was and what ...\nWhat do you what are your questions about deal but he seems to be I mean it sounds dumb but it seems to be the real deal I mean why not vote for him if he sounds like he's the right guy if you want conservative a conservative in that seat I mean anybody to the right of of Elizabeth Warren would be better with ...\nThat that's what I'm gonna do it but I'm just wondering what what you are a assessment as well as so far as a whole as to how the election might come out this is a gas there I mean you you you talked to a lot of people I just wanted to get some idea that people are concerned well in the house is going to go to the uh if the house goes\nThe wrong way and I guess she uh uh people trying to carry on this investigation which has gone on for two years of the president right indefinitely and I just wanted to get your feeling on it as a as a host in a completely different part of the country\nWell I'll tell you what I've been saying and I and I really do think this is going to be two to four seats in a ... increase on the uh in the Senate I think the Republicans or conservatives will gain seats in the Senate\nUm I think that on the house it's a toss up I don't know what's gonna happen in the house I Hope that the the energy that the writer got out of what happened with Kavanaugh will continue I Hope that the tax cuts that'll continue I Hope that jobs coming back that's going to continue it really it look at the bottom line is this going to come out to turn out\nThe left is going to turn out they always do the right needs to turn out to make sure that we keep things going on with the going I think that lives with Warren is in trouble no she can lose out of low but when it comes to the actual numbers house and Senate or the Senate is pretty firmly going to stay Republican I think that the house is still a toss up and could certainly go left if people ... don't go and vote\nHe like that that has to point I mean you've got a someone like a I Believe that someone or all the same general philosophy as a Ocasio Cortez in New York that is taking a seat for my uh uh I think if the seventh district whatever I thank you very much\nI appreciate you think you are you got a lot of people who are saying that the Elizabeth Warren is up by a lot\nAnd I'm good I'm looking at the polling here I I Hope that Jeff deal still has a chance\nAnd perhaps we'll have um a corner on soon to talk about this ... is the guy who I turn to when it comes to what's happening in Boston in Massachusetts and even actually is very good great brain on him and he does he was a great show on under your kale Monday through friday noon or so we'll find out I mean he certainly will even it was promising at last we spoke\nBut I'm at this point I mean I'm looking at the spread and she's up by twenty five points to thirty six points in some of these polls I'm not sure how good these polls are uh the latest one is a plus twenty five and this is from UMass Lowell\nSo I'm not really sure what if anything can change their but still to me it looks like at least two seats will be gained in the Senate by the Republicans if not three or four it's eight eight nine four one packs editing nine four one Seventy two four seven Joe ... dot com coming right back\n[noise] hot [noise]\n\nMany bedrooms bedtime is

I didn't forget that so here we go to America [noise] Adam\n... way back we talked about first responders and I kind of wanted to throw that out again today because of an incident that happened\nRecently with a a dear friend of ours his wife got in a very serious car accident and he was relating this story that are the people\nThat showed up the police the ambulance and then the the the surgeon\nAt the hospital all these people it was like a a symphony of making sure that this gal was going to be okay and so at listening to his story it made me realize that you know at the end of the day when things happen\nWe want those first responders to be at the top of their game right trust and we want them to have had a good night's sleep we want the surgeon to not be drinking caffeinated coffee we want them to I'm kidding but we want them to be at\nOut of the annuities out of the life insurance and you're right the markets backup\nYet have you hurt your annuities or have you hurt your life insurance now and we explain all that to you ... come to a greater understanding and appreciation just adds to the leverage that these vehicles can provide\nSo that's something that you really I encourage you to consider it to me it's all about positioning\n\nAnd part of this means that you have to have the guts the the the the inter intestinal fortitude to go look I Want to address this now is\nIt a popular topic you'd probably at this point of view I gather the kids around the room you're telling and go play go outside more what Mark's talking about is not for your ears it's PG Thirteen it's like oh my goodness the stuff he is saying is going to happen looked a math\nDoesn't lie it just doesn't and so this movie\nIf you'd like to see the trailer the two and a half minute trailer to the power of zero you can email me\nI had a gentleman I emailed it to me [laughter] he emailed me back he goes to this is scary stuff you know it's almost so scary people dismiss it they got there's absolutely no way this was going to happen so here's the question what if I'm wrong\nWhat is this stuff never happens have we heard you by how we position how we re deploy how we put you in in areas where we are protecting\nWhat you have a mass what you have created what you have grown the answer is no we aren't you know\nWell let's say I'm right you will come out on top you will have done that\nYou don't you know let's say I'm right you will come out on top you will have done the very best the most prudent thing you can do at this juncture by position yourself for what I Believe is inevitable this is not politically expedient aren't you\nJust tired I Know I Am and I noticed Asian plays the ads and all I'm just tired I'm sick and tired I'll use I'm sick and tired frustrated over all the political ads that are running and the name calling and listen to that and to that and it is and\nYou know what it's just I'm I'm done with it I mean can't we taught those people all of them my opinion they don't really care and this is my opinion mark any can write me hate me hate mail whatever\nThey're in this for them they're in this for them it's not politically expedient for them to say you know what we have to raise taxes you have to cut benefits we have to switch the\nFull retirement age for Social Security nobody wants to say that because then they're not going to get reelected but what I'm saying to you right now is so important that if you don't have\nThis you're not going to be positioned to take advantage of when the bad news comes\nSo here's a couple of questions I Want to ask you and oh by the way that two and a half minute trailer just email me mark at more F. S.\nDot com market more F. S. dot com emailed me I'll send you the trailer no hooks no catches no obligations just something you need to know in fact at the office we are we we we kind of kid ourselves back and forth we say you know what\nNot only do most people not believe this message\nMost financial advisors don't believe this message they are not talking to people about what's coming because at the end of the day they're

superstar within your family with in your neighborhood\nWithin your world there'll be looking at you going well how did you how do you know this was coming well you know I listen to the smart money moves on Saturday and he's talking about this I went and saw the movie the power is zero I saw the trailer I've read the book I I I'm now more students now more aware of what's going on in our world and why\nPaul kitchens are not talking about this\nThe presses are rolling the printing presses are printing money at an astronomical rate and as a result we are putting our kids our grandkids in harm's way\nWhat's the message the message is and then we'll talk about these questions here what's ... what's the strategy here's a strategy your weight and you've got your pen pencil and ... taxes are on sale\nToday pay the tax get it over with just be done with it\nPut your money in a in an environment where it all grows zero tax will mark what if the government changed the laws you know there's always that opportunity yet you're right\nBut historically what has happened is if you're in certain vehicles where its tax exempt when you go to pull it out they grandfather\nThose policies those plans that are already in place so don't let that concern you what should concern you is what this trailer is two and a half minute trailer is saying to you\nSo don't do what the politicians are doing which is sticking\nAnd you is what this trailer there's two and a half minute trailer is saying to you so don't do what the politicians are\nDoing which is sticking their heads in the sand and hoping that it blows by them at least so that they can get reelected what you should be doing is saying what do I need to do today to protect my kids and my grandkids and my family what am I doing today to protect them\nThat's what the message is pay the taxes they get it over with taxes are on sale is that debatable will I get and get all these calls ... taxes are on sale look at look how much I'm paying my taxes\nYeah I get that\nBut if worse if we're spending a trillion dollars more than we're taking in every year and what what hasn't helped is the fact that tax rates were cut I think about that I\nMean I Love Trump either what he's doing attach races were cut tax rates were cut in spending has been increased then it's a it's a double whammy right\nBut it's not too late for you

develop a strategy that would prevent you from being hurt by any of this stuff\nAll the stuff I'm mentioning over the last twenty four minutes ways what if it was possible to develop that strategy so you wouldn't get hurt would you want to know about it if I'm waiting in the roadway the bridges out ahead the bridges out ahead go down this road and you might be thinking well as march tricking me is that real really safe\nIs that it's safe\nSo that would be question number to look the bridge is out ahead it is out ahead I'm here warning you right now and then if we were to develop a strategy where you are always safe it's kind of a two part or here would that be good enough\nIf we only stay safe and we never make any money is that really what we know we're going to help you get position so you can take advantage of what I said a little while ago when this stuff happens\n\nBecause we will still be here it's just a matter of what will the state of the economy will be looking like\nAnd when things start to rebound don't even want to take that back up that's when everybody gets you for it that's when everybody's excited hey we've been through the worst I'm throwing you today on this

like that happened to you we're going to talk about that coming up here and just a little bit we haven't mentioned long term care in a while and then look am I going to continue to beat this horse yes I Am because the message is so important you need to be prepared for what's coming\nAnd when you see this movie when we invite you and you come in and you see a Seventy five minute documentary about where we're going as a society\nIt will certainly be very sobering and you'll say mark I now know I Need to do something the two and a half minute trailer will do that as well so make sure he emailed me market more F. S. dot com coming up we want to talk about long term care coverage and\nWhat it means because it's not about you going into a facility it's what happens to your family as a result of that is not about the risks it's about the consequences\nState to more of smart money\nAnd put them in a much better position you know it's great to say hey I said you're a bunch of money but yeah look at the new the new benefits is like there will down to almost no he's going to walk away he and his wife are going to say oh my goodness you position does better and gave us more benefits for less money\nI go yeah isn't isn't that what we're supposed to be doing and more financial that's that's why we're in business we are here to put you in a better position to position you so when this stuff happens that were just been talking about and I had this conversation with him there Bob in their heads up and now going yeah we got we got to be prepared for this and you do\nSo please give us a call two nine six four four six four we are here for you this is about you this is not about more so what's the message to the messages the bridge is out ahead the bridges out ahead\nAnd people asked well how how can insurance companies do what they do mark you talk about a lot about insurance look I'm a a investment advisor representative\nAnd so I can put people in the markets I can charge fees I can do all that for ... area and all that but the message today is is what I'm saying is true then you really need a safe\nHaven you need to migrate towards what the insurance industry is offering why is because they had been built they have been designed for times like\nThis today is the day draw the line and this and say I'm going to call Mark I'm going to call the team right now I'm going to make an appointment what are you saying has captivated me\nOther people that I listen to I talked to I go on I ... they're not this is not their message\nThe message is not hate attacks today and get it over with\nThat's not the message to the message is max out your four one K. plant by term insurance match once you ... if I make sure you do an IRA do this do that it's all about for the most part rates of return I don't want to play that game because it is a game\nDon't want to do that won't go there and won't do that so give us a call two nine six four four six four to nine six four four six four I have to mention this thing as well\nAnd I think it's important and it it dovetails very much so and what we're talking about when it comes to long term care and I I'm hoping my prayer my uh\nMy hope is that we can get Mr Harley Gordon to come to town he's a uh you'd probably one of the foremost a elder care attorneys in the country and he's written a book\nAnd so I said a little bit ago before the break we're going to talk about his book it's called the convert station called the conversation and this is what are you know trust instead it's this conversation people don't want to have\nThis how how apropos to ... book\nAnd the subtitle is helping someone you love plan for an extended care event\nIt's easy for me and I'm I'm not going to do this but it would be easy for me to take out all the statistics that are out there about how many people are going to need long term care how many people every sixty four seconds are diagnosed with Alzheimer's or dementia\nYou know what that does not connect with people we think as agents that it does it it will put people in a position of they start to worry they get anxious\nThat does not connect with people we think as agents that it does it it will put people in a position of they start to worry they get anxious\nThis anxiety they've created say wow I Need to pick up the phone and call those guys one person every sixty eight seconds is being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia wanted to ask me well folks that doesn't encourage people to do the planning it just scares them into maybe not doing anything\nSo Harley's book really brings front and center the idea that it's not about now I'm Talking to the guy here\nWhen they get this it's us guys we have a hard time with\nA guy guys men gentleman it's not about the risk of you ending up in a facility or having to have care\nThat's not what's at stake here that's not the issue that's not what you're jeopardizing what you are jeopardizing and this is the real message\nIs the consequence of you not having a plan the consequences of what's going to happen to you I'm Sorry to your family your kids your grandkids your spouse should something happen to you this is Carol is\nIn fact if you don't have a plan it is likely that will it will tear your family apart\nIt will tear your family apart\nNot having a plan and not properly funding it can disrupt all efforts to secure a sense of financial viability as you and your family move into the future that's what not having a plan will do\nYou know what we have a deep as a gay guys again women you can don't have listeners but us guys\nWe by nature heavy deep seated aversion to thinking about anything truly awful occurring do you like nobody nobody gets up in the day hey what if I get in a car accident today what if I have a stroke whatever Mart nobody likes to think about that stuff\nOr do they like to think what if I have a need for care what if I'm going to have to have somebody paid me feed me clothe me take me to doctors appointments\nAnd so as a result because nobody thinks about it the subject is dismissed and that's what ... contention is\nThat being more the case certainly when you're talking about hey you need to own a long term care insurance policy so what Harley's hope when he put together this book was to change your mind by altering how the subject is talked about\nWhat I Hope to do what my goal is when I have this conversation yeah the conversation and nobody wants to have is to say this\nIs that when I'm done I Want you and your mind as say mark Jeff really the conversation the consequences are too severe\nThat I Need to take action I Need to do something because I don't want to put I don't want to have my kids my grandkids my spouse left to deal with this\nSee one way or the other you're going to be kept safe if you have an incident you have an extended care event they are going to find a way to take care of you we know that we're here in America right somebody will rise up something will happen whether you have money you don't have you will be taken care of\nThat's not the problem the problem is what is going to happen to your family it's about your commitment to protect your family regardless of what happened\nTo your family it's about your commitment to protect your family regardless of what happens to you the book talks about as he says you're the serious and often irreversible consequences providing care\nCan have on those you invited into your life I think about that\nThe consequences to those you love you said yes to the altar you\nNow have embraced over the years you saw them through elementary school and middle school and high school and college and now they have careers and now are they going to have to put their life on hold see we have that conversation that's a conversation a lot of people don't want to have it hits you square between the I just like oh my goodness\nWell Mark I don't think that's ever going to happen well okay let's have a plan so just in case it does happen look you're going to be fine\nBut it's the consequences to those you love and you care about those are going to be the ones that you might be doing irreversible damage to should you not have a plan in place\nThat's what Harley's book is about a I Believe it's in reprint right now they're they're printing more and so we're hoping to get some of those as well that may be a give away you you want to call you say mark a when you get a copy of the conversation yes what do I have to deal you have to come in you have\nTo have the conversation with us and then we'll give you the conversation but look if you don't want to have your family put their lives on hold to take care of you then you need to have a plan in place that's our our encouragement to you have a plan in place\nBecause this is what Harley says and I'll conclude with this he says\nWhat most people don't understand is that extended care is not a series of risks that would happen to them but rather a set of serious if not irreversible consequences that would happen to those that you love\nThis is risk\nVersus consequences that's really at the end of the day what this is about so give us a call two nine six\nFour four six four to nine six four four six four call me on my cell two three five nine for six five two three five nine for six five will you have this conversation with us at more financial we hope that you will\nA couple of months ago I talked about the perfect financial plan\nThe perfect financial plant is that possible we believe that it is in fact society dictates to us that whatever it is that you as an industry put together it needs to be simple it needs to be efficient and so we're happy to let you know that we have figured that out this does\nLack of understanding and knowledge and that's really been one of my main desires just let's just get the\nWord out and let people make the best decision for that call more financial

media\n... thinks that Americans actually are going to believe it however I personally see now because the real war that as being waged is done on line pulled the political war\nAnd I personally have left wing friends who now kind of come out and said this has gone way too far it's way too obvious due to the timing of it\nAnd I let let let's just get real here let's just get real here just for a second I mean who really males a bomb to people who don't even open their own mail\nThat's where this goes Leon is here with me go ahead and\nContribute please you know I thought about that as soon as

Republicans are out pacing Democrats in early voting in key states and this is coming from and B. C. [noise]\nUh yes the Republicans are coming out in droves they are putting their early voting ballots right in the mail as soon as they get it the left wing is hoping for what dead people and illegals\nWell that certainly looks like it is and that's why we've got of course such big caravans of illegal immigrants heading for the United states this is a democratic voting bloc\nThat they desperately need and that's what you really see here is desperation if you're a Democrat a strategy us let's say and you're planning on this big blue wave coming through which historically it does during mid term elections\nA strategy us let's say and you're planning on this big blue wave coming through which historically a does during mid term elections you lose this one and the Republicans keep both the Senate and the house and you've got an apocalypse for the Democrat\nIt would and not just the Democrats for the elite for the ... this is devastating that is the aluminum ... who clearly has orchestrated this caravan and many more to follow they are behind is just not just Democrats Democrats or the little people okay that are millions that are stupid\nThat are the toy soldiers that are the horrors\nOf the ... said you use the word or an I'm allowed to use the word or because it's in the Bible so for any of you fake Christians out there ...

Ecuador or whatever other country they've come from they're here to take you over ... plain and simple they're not even hiding it and the only\nOne who is trying to be the deceptive con again is the

what we're looking at at this caravan that the ... the cons and the media that the press the huge once you do think they are part of the invasion to they are the enemy CNN is the enemy\nAnd that's LSD

pond sacrifice there's times where you have to sacrifice the ponds for a greater good you looming Audi will gladly do it and I daresay here in the political environment in which we live\nI think that the Democrats might if this gets worse and the NBC\nPoll showed that the Republicans are showing more and more support\nIn the next two weeks and I don't think it's going to I don't think it's just going to shut down and I don't think that that the Democrats are going to get a search I don't think so I don't think this is enough because I see the war that's being launched online and they're losing even left wing people are waking up so what they might have to do is sacrifice one of the big boys\nOne of the one of the rocks well don't have the nights wouldn't you say that there is an air

very risky gamble on their part because there are a lot a lot of Americans I daresay the majority of Americans\nIs a very risky gamble on their part because there are a lot a lot of Americans I daresay the majority of Americans\nWould not want this whole\nCaravan become entering the United states no no not at all even if a Trump send troops to the border and if he shuts down the border there'd be a lot of people in America that will rally behind that but when you take very risky gambles\nIt tends to show that you're desperate and I believe that is where ... with what you were mentioning regarding Republican early voting\nThis is not part of the playbook this was not part of the strategy for the Democrat Party they wanted to build a wave even before election day whether I have\nA democratic early voting total that is not coming to pass\nAnd furthermore I say these things to protect the livelihood of not just\n... just not you know your your average American out there I'm trying to protect real immigrants from real misery 'cause guess worthy let's just take a wild guess where are these new migrants these illegals where are they going to live in America\nI dare say they're not going to live in the white neighborhoods in the foothills\nThey're not going to live there they're not going to live amongst white people at all really not the majority a few of them probably will but the majority will not and I'm Talking like Ninety percent they're going\nIn South Tucson they're going to live where a lot of real immigrants live and so now the real immigrants have a real choice you know the Democratic party seems to have my back\nBut I'm the one who's going to have their car broken into I'm the one who's going to have some my kid get bullied in school by all these little migrants have that that know lawlessness that's all they know they they they truly believe they're here to rule and they're going to take it out on my kid\nI'm the one who's going to be broken into in my house I'm the one who's going to have graffiti all over their house\nAnd you know this is I think you're exactly right this is going to be a conflict between legal\nAnd illegal immigrants here you go these illegal immigrants what kind of English skills do they have the reports are little to not well what about the legal immigrants that are in this country what is what is preventing them from getting better paying jobs their language skills\nLegal immigrants God Bless ya keep studying your English but their English skills are limited so what do you have you've got a whole bunch of illegal immigrants coming into this country\nAnd they are rivaling and challenging legal immigrants for jobs that don't require fluent English and then\nYou think of as the legal immigrants and just your normal person on the left\nYour going to now have to be in the welfare aligned with these new illegals you're gonna have to go you will go to the same doctors that they do and they're going to get in front of you\nYou are going to suffer the ... it's always the poor it's always the poor who suffered the most because of the crap from Washington and this is nothing more it's more than crap this is an act of war against its own people and of course it will be the poor who take the brunt of it and you could also say the middle class\nI'll I'll gladly add the middle class into that\nUm that category who will suffer the most from it\nYou know it was it was not long ago that the Democrats said they would they went from being against foreign interference in elections to allowing non citizens to vote and that's exactly what they are declaring\nLet the non citizens but we want the non citizens but I had a left wing friend who who was adamant telling me\nDeclaring let the non citizens but we want the non citizens but I had a left wing friend who who was adamant telling me into thousands sixteen there was no illegal immigrants voting in California\nLike hell there were millions of illegal immigrants that were involved not just in California but all over the country that we're interfering lecture you get you do it yet I have to hear about Russian collusion from you\nSo it's time now that the left wing you have seen enough now I I I Can't talk to the legal because they're not even here yet they they will be the people we vote against and the next election\nOkay but now I'm On I'm saying to the to the legal immigrants out there you need to speak up you weren't going to suffer the most and it is time to abandon Nancy Pelosi is time to a bandage Chuck Schumer and the rest of the pigs that are going to steal from you and make your life a living hell\nSo it can make our all of our lives I mean who am I can look at look at this look at this uh I I ... I was reading this I found it very very interesting uh the middle class is disappearing from California's the wealth gap grows do you understand that Democrats rule in California\nAnd they are always said oh we're going to take from the rich and give to the poor\nAnd yet their actions do the exact opposite it dwindled to the middle class\nIt windows it's getting worse and worse and it's going to continue to do so why because you have guys like Jerry Brown in charge you had these left wing idiots that all they care about is their precious elections and they're dirty money that they get from\nCorporate corporations that they say they're against but actually they're taking like Goldman Sachs\nThey're ruled by Goldman Sachs oh we're so against the ... percent oh we're so much against this white privilege but actually they're taking all kinds of dirty money from the worst of them like George Soros who just then\nWhen I when in doubt I'm just going to mail a bomb to myself and blame it on Trump\nThat's where we're at in this country ladies and gentlemen that is where this is so important that you understand the conspiracy that's behind this because it's not going to end\nI said I've been seeing it for three and a half years on the radio now this was going to get worse\nThis is going to get worse they're going to do more of it you're going to see a great awakening however the evil that evil conspiracy is going to pour in a legal to support their operation as the real left wing people who actually have a brain cell wake up\nThat's where we're at in this country\nYou know I credit Trump with I'm making illegal immigration a major issue for discussion and the public forum I remember in the I'm a campaign for the twenty sixteen election immigrant illegal immigration I knew what was there and there was a problem\nI didn't think it was a big problem and I didn't think that there was a conspiracy behind it but you know Trump really made this a central issue in his campaign\nOr their own individual football team that was the thousands of people going into the rally but let's talk about the ones who wanted to protest the protest it was a good thirty or forty of 'em and they were surrounded by police and how we got close hey\nLet's let's go check this out let's go check this they have their banners and their flags holding up and their painted sign snowboarder wall led immigrants in whatever blah blah blah and we get closer and closer and then they and then they're across the street from where the line was and then they start to cross the street towards the Trump people I just honestly I don't know what\nI don't know what got into myself I just felt the need to confront them and to tell them something yes and as they as they were chanting uh I I was there was a wave\nOf non Christianity in me that said you need to really say something fun here you need to enjoy your friday evening while these\nGuys that are in their black masks and there's antifa caps in handkerchief so over their mouth and race they call them start coming across the street so I started going across the street towards them\nAnd while they're chanting their little chance I get right up into one of the little girls the couches college age or whatever I Can't really tell because she was massed and I and I ... I I scream at her\nSix sweetie smaller years a trap\nAnd you're going to love it you're done a lot of it and then I went to the next one and I could tell he didn't like that yes they are like that 'cause their eyes got bigger\nAnd you're going to love it you're done a lot of it and\nThen I went to the next one and I could tell he didn't like that yes they are like that 'cause their eyes got bigger you know that\nTriggered poster that girl from college and she's ... because of it and you can tell it in her eyes they started to get trigger because they're supposed to they're supposed to inject\nFear into ... getting him a date\nAnd we obviously weren't intimidated because then I look behind me and Chris here is doing a little dance to achieve\nYeah he was dancing in front of them like three feet in front of them mocking their shit yeah ladies and the antifa quartet\nFriday night live in Mesa and so Chris does this dance in the meantime I go up behind them and the police didn't like the spy and care [noise] I get up right up behind\nThem and I say six years you\nKnow they didn't like that either in and then they started to feel themselves a little intimidated because then there were a few of us behind them and now they started to feel a little sandwich and the place that serves you can't do that you can't do that\nGo on go on the sidewalk go on the sidewalk and so I started walking as I bump instead of going on the sidewalk ladies and gentlemen\nAnother wave of non Christian fun came upon me and I got right in the middle of the street and I decided to moon them Kiss My white\nWhite privileged rich ass I told them at the top of my lungs I could tell that got triggered in the meantime Chris continues today yes yes\nIt is more fun I've had on a friday\nAnd then I've had in a long time like ... and ... and I dare say to those who listen to the show you have to try it because what did you call it surreal\nSurreal it didn't didn't seem it almost seemed like it was a show or it's staged they would have hair but it it doesn't have like what you see in television typically the wasn't that that kind of hostile type crowd this was more of a belligerent type of crowd they would\nHave liked to go on hostile but the Mesa police was right on top of them yeah they had shot guns ... everything ready for that by police on horseback police and cars\nAnd it was like what about ten or Fifteen to them and then we had what about maybe twenty two protestors right there so it was almost half\nCovering them and then you had another thirty on the other side of the street that were more of the uh run of the mill they were regular just holding up placards and not to mention those of us were actually getting up in their face I'm sure there would have been a trove of\nTrump supporters that we're still in line who would love to have joined us at this got thing got a little rough yes Leon you were a little bit more soft spoken out there but you were kind of part of it to tell tell us what you saw well\nYou know what's interesting when you see these protesters and this is the same thing you saw with the Kavanaugh protesters a with protesters that tried to hone McConnell or other Republican leadership [noise] all they're there to do is just chat just chat just\nOver and over and over again I Know KKK in the usa love not ... I've got\nAll of these slogans down they've got all of this down\nAnd they they're not there to have a conversation with you they're not there to share their views with you there\nThere are just shy chant and showed\nA bullhorn and hopefully get some mainstream media\nTheir views with you there\nThere are just shy chant and showed a bullhorn and hopefully get some mainstream media coverage\nSo that this Trump rally isn't just portrayed on mainstream media as Trump supporters but there's got to be a token group of protesters to show the Trump always stirs up the worst in people we don't approve of his policy ya know right\nRight but they're just mindlessly repeating themselves over and over I mean if you try to get into a conversation with them they're not ready for that ... they're they're not equipped yes they're just going to chat you were shouted down with\nThat of course they're trying to bring about intimidation they want to intimidate you we are coming up against you we\nResist stern says\nYou're not the resistance sweetheart when the corporate corrupt land of make believe or should I say corporate horror pressed to to to set the con media when therefore you you're not the resistance when the one percent of one percent of one percent of one percent when the George Soros ... when the\nYes when the evil corrupt elitist global ... pig [laughter]\nAre you you're not the resistance when\nThe military industrial complex when Monsanto\nWhen uh the educational destined complex the very people putting you hundreds of thousand dollars in debt when you agree with them or not the resistance at all and that is a swift kick in the pants all those who are on the left wing need to learn\nYou are not the resistance you are actually the problem and you're going to continue to be the problem until you wake up now I daresay many ... on the left are waking up\nThey are starting to see this for what it is they're starting to see that the left are going violent and I hope those who are even activists in the left wing movement are seeing that the conservatives are not scared of the matter of fact Chris dances in front of you he actually likes that\nContinue to practice practice and you're a off time\nIt's really good it's really good and some of them some it depends if they get in unison than it was good but yeah I Do that like twenty or thirty that were there near ... everybody was shot and different things so nobody was really in unison so they won't even presenting a United front it just happened to be those four or five\nHappened instruction in the same thing over and over and it it almost sounded like a it's a song of some kind that's why me and this other guy just started dancing the Trump supporter just walking on by throwing insults and they weren't phase what was going on they had to go see the president\nAnd that is how you beat them is when you do not show that you were scared of them that you will go toe to toe with them and that is what completely deflate ...\nIs when they they see that you are actually willing to go up against them because they're in ... when it that's what they are cowards they they wear masks because they're cowards\nEvil is always like that the cockroaches are always like that just turned on the light show 'em yet you're not scared you get right in their face and you say no we're not going to let you do to this country what you want to do and that's when they turn down that's when you can see\nTheir that their their enthusiasm go down you dance right in front of them you're not intimidated all of a sudden our chance are not working our intimidation is not working I daresay their violence is going to they're going to meet their match at some point there's always a bigger fish especially when it comes to fight the bullies do get bullied\nAnd when he runs into that I don't know what it's going to be\nBut when they run into a boy you are going to say no no I don't want because they're cowards at the end of the day\nI don't know what it's going to be but when they run into a boy you are going to see no no I don't want because they're cowards at the end of the day\nYou know I've got a theory on why they wear these masks among other things I think one of the reasons why they were these masks they don't want to be recognized because if they're breaking the law they don't want to be recognized but they also don't want to be recognized\nAt rally after rally after rally the same losers showing up at all the Trump rallies they don't want to make it look like they're just paid participants who hit the road every time Trump has a rally\nThey're the same rules the same losers who have learned the same chance rental and there was this that what was that that little evil man it was just one little disgruntled evil you to go\nBack to sell the land back so land\n... so he wants us to do you understand what Native Americans Indians used to do to each other before they they the less paint this picture like Indians had this utopia\nPeace love and harmony that's all it wasn't smoking federation and smoking are pipe that's all they did all day and we and we danced around the fire that's what they that they lived off the land they lived on my they were used everything and didn't wait oh any with nature and it was just so perfect in wonderful yet you talk to the total

I just want to point out that the news media is saying that President Trump invented this this taunted this mockery of a\nOf a Senator Warren with her phony Indian thing and that's not true this has been going on for a long time this mockery of of her of her ridiculous claim\nSenator Warren blister ancestry report and it said that\nThe great majority of Warren's identifiable ancestry is European however the report adds the analysis also identified five genetic segments as Native American in origin at high confidence and this is what Elizabeth Warren put out now this is a a joke of course\nHowever yesterday afternoon Cherokee Nation released a statement saying\nIn part that DNA tests are useless in determining tribal citizenship and people are using DNA to connect themselves to Cherokee Nation is inappropriate\nAnd ah that was a a gentle right on what they said because they were a little more direct the statement itself says from the Cherokee Nation\nA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish\nListen to this whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and wild DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nI senator or you're going to you racists you began are you going to stop offending Native Americans now it makes a mockery out of DNA tests\nAnd it's a legitimate uses while also this honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage that is from the

citizen of the Indian nation and member of an Indian nation\nDNA and best can give you some indicators of some markers that to indicate that you're related to somebody who live long ago that may have Lyndon north and South America maybe in a native\nPeoples of those continents um\nIt's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native Americans in this country\nIt is irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American so this whole thing was just want want want it's Emily would tell law it's never mind my DNA test doesn't say anything in fact if it indicates anything it indicates that I Am less Native American than the average Whitey\nOn the moon okay [laughter]\nI got to get to Whitey on the moon a little later on why is Whitey on the moon in the show today well you might be surprised but it's another reason I'll get to it in a little bit on the other reason they're crazy people now let's go to Elizabeth Warren she's out there saying that the president or a million dollars let's go to number four\nBecause this is what President Trump actually said when he made this or the news media and and and Elizabeth Warren not smart people not the really you can't take them seriously\n... saying no President Trump or a million dollars because she fulfilled all of the requirements that President Trump laid out if she gets a DNA test\nAnd it proves that she is in fact part Paul Paul than President Trump owes her a million dollars this is the phony arguing that they just lie about everything they live right by Brett Kavanaugh there a lot about Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton lies about everybody they lie about everything\nAnd a President Trump actually said these words in July about the DNA tests\nYou know those little kids they saw on television for two dollars\nAnd first of all the little kids and in\n[noise] which he claims that she's of Indian\nBecause her mother said she has hiking thoughts that's\nThat her mother such yet I think about when he was\nVery gently take that can I say\nMillion dollars\nIf you take a test that it shows you're in\n\n[noise]\nNow the test does not show she's an Indian be a debate has not happened she is not the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United states has not given her the uh the uh DNA tests on a stage during the presidential debate a and a and and I didn't\nHear him call her mother a liar which is another late and that what she said that she keeps calling my mother a liar President Trump keeps going my mother a liar that he didn't call a Elizabeth Warren's mother mall pall a liar didn't call anybody a liar\nBecome my mom a liar\nHe didn't do that so she just lied there in calling uh\nLiar he didn't want to call my mom a liar\nYeah he didn't do that and he's so she just lied there in calling a\nSaying that President Trump was lying about her mother being a liar there's a lot of lying going on here it's a circle festive lives a tangled train wreck ... stupidity\nBut there it is um he didn't say that your mother's alarm or he did say that you have to become the nominee be on a debate stage she gives you the DNA kid you don't get to pick your own DNA person who is a you know a corrupt to Democrats fellow travelers from a college campus\nBut it did when a CNN listen to that or watch that video this morning Alison Schmidt Allison ... who used to be a reporter listened to it

be present for at least a couple of the executions so they filmed the executions for them so that he could see them later at least a couple where they hand or a Hitler's enemies with piano wire\nAnd Hitler wanted to watch the films of this so is print saw him on the the uh the culprit here behind the curtain\nQuite possibly and perhaps quite probably that said\nThere's a lot of palace intrigue around there these days you know he turned the Ritz hotel in Riyadh into a prison and through a bunch of his cousins in to a luxury sweets but they were not allowed to leave they could get room

eight nine four one packs and an eight nine to one Seventy two four seven whatever you long for the ride ...\nI I'm just wondering is was that proof positive yesterday that in fact the NFL players do not want to solve the problem whatever the problem is that they proceed with the ...\nDo they not know why they're kneeling that could be another thing so you had Amy Schumer and funny Amy Schumer complain there's not enough white players were kneeling\nFeeling that could be another thing so you had Amy Schumer and funny Amy Schumer complain that not enough white players were kneeling and then a couple of players will happen to be black and I'll think race as an issue here or you should be anyway I'm going at each other because one's allegedly a sellout because the NFL set a hundred million dollars do you\nUm to help solve whatever this problem is that you say there is is there really no solution and the NFL players will keep on doing this the NFL will keep losing viewers and fans the NFL will keep losing money and um well money that they're still making money but losing money as as compared to what they could be making\nIs is that league just done because I Can't imagine that this is\nGoing to last much longer where you live there are people teetering I'm like I Love the NFL I'm gonna watch any way on a grab a snack while they're kneeling during the anthem gonna pretend it's not happening eventually people will crack look you're not going to find a bigger Miami Dolphins fan than I Am\nDon't even know who the starting quarterback is now I guess it's still what's his face Ryan what's his nose I'd do with the tannahill I don't know I guess\nI ... and people try to tell me if they're doing very well to see them do I deal with the record is don't care I don't know who they're starting running back is don't care to know who they're big wide receiver as the guy who has the most sects have no clue don't care haven't watched the second to the NFL this season not even a highlight\nWhen it comes to my local news I shut it off\nThat's where I Am now I'm not unique when it comes to that there were a lot of people who have reclaimed their Sunday and Monday and Thursdays they have and it might not ever go back\nBut when you get right down to brass tacks and you say you're kneeling for a cause and you say okay we've actually taken action on the cause for what you say you're kneeling\nNow let's get back to playing football start standing up and then you call somebody else a sellout for accepting that somebody that the league actually said we're listening to you are we doing something about it\nThere's something wrong with you Ben at that point there's something wrong with you it's a eight eight nine for one pack Joe packs dot com let me go to the phone lines and say hello to Zack who's in Alabama Zach what's going on high\nHey so I just want to say you know first off or only bringing up one player in all the NFL right now right know ... ... so you have a problem with right now or no no no no no I have\nA problem with anybody who's kneeling Aaron Reid's just dumb enough to go after somebody who actually set a hundred million dollars is good Eric read is the guy of the day because he attacked somebody who stopped kneeling 'cause the guy who started feeling said a hundred million dollar investment into what our problem is is a good thing so go ahead I'm listening\nBut what did a hundred million dollars to do what can they do a lot right right and it's no good I don't really is no good but knocking Jenkins wasn't protesting the NFL or you\nKnow he was protesting well\nAgain you have to go back to a Catholic said originally captured even even nobody was protesting it was making that up because he was benched and then a bunch of other people jumped on board for whatever reason they were protesting the alleged depression there is no oppression in this country that's alive go to a country where there is operation of an old no there is no oppression here you know why we have laws that actually say\nUnder law must offer equal opportunity to everybody in this country so you think there was a pressure and maybe you should go to China or Venezuela and find out about oppression go ahead what else\nOkay just you know just because you know there is no there is there's more or less they're legally they're legally isn't legally there is in our laws actually for bitter Russian and anybody but there is no murders in America\nOh no no nobody said that but by law if you're being oppressed and you bring it highlighted ...\nMurder anybody are are you smoking crack happen people commit crimes\nLaw if you are being oppressed and you bring it highlighted and\nMurder anybody are\nAre you smoking crack happen people commit crimes\nThat doesn't mean that that crime is legal I'm telling you that our laws\nActually say you can't oppressed people I mean we have it in our our actual constitution when slavery ended we got the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four there are actual laws in place that say oppression is illegal so if it does happen\nBring it to light guys like me and I'm guessing guys like you will say hey something illegal is happening here let's stop it so you're comparing that to murder is actually kinda dumb but again the NFL is throwing a hundred million dollars at whatever this causes\nAnd Malcolm Jenkins says hey I

Fidel Castro shirt and pretend like that guy somehow was the opposite of oppression what else you got\n[laughter] I'm done here you are done with their economy\nListen when you get wound up like Barry even when they get well when you get wound up when you get wound up when you get wound up and you want to call in and straighten up a talk show hosts and make sure that you actually have a clue I asked you very simply very directly do you think a hundred million dollars can go\nAnd help would ever the problem is of these players say is out there your answer was what's a hundred million dollars going to do that's really your answer seriously you think that's a an intelligent answer\nOkay ... you're saying yes or no to use their American intelligent answer\nSome of your family members I think\nThat's an intelligent answer I ask you a very direct question do you think that a hundred million dollars won't do anything to help\nNo well then why did\nYou asked me the question what's a hundred million dollars going to do those are the exact words you said\nWhy St money isn't going to change attitudes\nSubtle what shall I Do that in that one is going to get them to stop kneeling you seem to think you know what is it going to take\nNo ... and and I have no clue but if people like you need to change their attitude\nWhen I had a clue that I Love the country the attitude that I Love

what my father I loved ...\nWho's dead he went and served in the air force with a flag on his shoulder and I think that people should stand up in respect to service the I'm the guy I'm the problem really\nHello\nEverybody get so offended by the word ignorant if you're ignoring facts that are easily available to you if you're ignoring what's really happening you're being ignore rent\nIt is not a racial term it is not a gender based term it is not an ethnic term it is a term that has a definition you're ignoring facts\nSo you're being ignore rent that's the word the root of it is ignore so if you're somehow overtly offended by that weren't ignorant you're probably ignorant to its definition is what what do I know\nSo as you suggested the the song Spanish by the doors anybody know that song and murder Spanish by the doors\nI haven't\nHow 'bout Spanish Caravan by the doors as some call Spanish care of it in\n... now and I don't know yeah that into\nA Robin Wright who says says supposedly

I I didn't read up on on what he's mad about other than he called the guys sell out whatever but um yeah I ... again if I'm protesting something in a look I was in the UAE W the the auto workers union\nUm or the United auto workers in in ... Michigan I wasn't working on the assembly line I was in television newsroom\nI W why our channel twenty five in in second offline\nWhen I got under contract when I actually became the anchor there because they they're working it was a ... I had no taxes taken out it was I was a ten Ninety nine employee it was just trying to learn how to do the business back in Nineteen Ninety four or whatever it was and when I finally got you know a job and I was the like the main anchor\nThey had me sign a contract and the contract was well actually when they put me on the books they said you have to sign up you have to agree to pay dues and whatever to the UAE W\nAnd and I said well I don't understand them making cars Wyman well because we had a problem ten years ago the W. came in and they helped us with the problem and I learned more about how unions worked in a protest working out strikes worked in labor stoppage has worked and all that\n\nI also later in my career in the late Nineteen Ninety maybe Nineteen Ninety seven Ninety eight Ninety nine was in Flint when there was a big strike by the U.S W I've never covered a story like that where there weren't stipulations we're striking because we want\nThese things give us these things and we will go back to work so\nI'm going to go back to just being a logical guy in a rational human being and say okay you're kneeling I disagree with you Neal and I disagree with the several different reasons I'm hearing while you're kneeling but you're kneeling\nWhat are your demands what is it that you want what are the items that you need taking care of your stuff Neal and you're making a fool of our industry\nWhat is it the old ... that we need to do other than fire you off or teams which they can do and it probably should have already what is it that you want what we want a B C and D alright heres ABC Andy and you're still Neal now I Wonder what your problem is\nSort of a hundred million dollars wasn't me answer if that wasn't the answer if you know the NFL saying yes there is a problem\nThan uh you know I Want to hear it\nYou know somebody says here's the problem we're going to do what you want let's do this that and the other\nAnd you're still\nYou know somebody says here's the problem we're going to do what you want let's do this that and the other\n\nAnd you're still kneeling ... you're just feeling because you want to make a fool yourself or you want to be a spectacle you want the spotlight on your you ought to pretend like you know somebody you don't know\nIt's really just logic and common sense and rationale the problem\nWhether it's real or not is perceived to be there by these players that are ... how do we solve it\n\nThere is no answer then you're not really protest and you're just doing some because you feel like it it is it eight nine four one packs Joe packs dot com stay right here\n[noise] ...\nRight I'm On a bit of a mission a whole lot of us are on this mission because really factor is that exciting but one hundred per cent drug free answer for people struggling with back next shoulder hip or need paid let's face it almost every one over fifty struggles with occasional aches and pains due to aging an exercise\nAnd even everyday living right I feel like I'm On a mission because I Want you to try what I use a relief factor works for me why not try this really quick start\nIt's now discounted the only Nineteen Ninety five I usually know that is the majority of people who ordered the three week which started going to order more what does that tell you a hundred per cent drug free ingredients and just the right dosage that helps your own body deal with inflammation that's really quick start", "show_name": "James T.

going to be in West Virginia idea what's up\n[noise] yeah I'm On a are you I'm living the dream what's happening\nI can I ask you a personal question\nAbsolutely I was hoping you would yes\nAre you in shape them clothing\nUh I'm not a sheep it all in pretty much a wolf you you see what you get what you see is what you get my ...\nMaking sure that means you're a conservative on like on the side but you're leaning towards the Democrats air air so I took a chance with Joe when used like this statement when you made this statement President Trump is like a bull in a China shop\nRight ... years yeah\n... ... as a boy and a China shop there Joe interested in race everything right it destroys the ... it just it destroys politics\nAs usual listen I realized that you've got a little sheep seniors in your in your face or somebody on one with the sheep whole thing was here's here's what's real and I hear you I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna let you speaking I'm gonna let you speak it a second let me tell you what my metaphor was about the politics as usual the China shop was completely\nUnaware of Obama's presence because he made sure it's the pristine\nHe would not step on political toes while he was screwing up the country well he was making us look like idiots around the world well he was alone as Americans to die in Benghazi and was fast and furious guns this guy made race relations horrible\nBut the China shop was fine he would not have messed up the political China shop even a little bit Trump walks in exist screw you all watch this\nAnd he destroyed politics as usual the left he didn't take it\nBut the the even the moderates to take it I like what he's doing I think in being a mechanic shop is a good thing because he doesn't sit back and his laurels and just let the world happen so he looks good he doesn't care if he looks bad as long as he's doing well for the American people now I'll shut up you understand what I meant when I was going to have to say that\n\nSo why don't just say what's your name Joe\nWell I said that day and you weren't listening very well you look some boozer sheep's years down the writers\nNo they were talking about a year I heard it from not proud of the games I get it every day oh I didn't like that why don't people saying what they may\nI did I said the same thing a little while ago you just didn't understand that so I clarified\nOkay Joe anyway I Want to give you my opinion I'm a military man I sort of Twenty one years in the on three sheets that\nLake front lawn sign could go from the age of seven came up in jail\nOr just hit on forty ... anyway I studied uh Germany when Germany won't bore now like Hitler get it all by ourselves way early and then twenty starting in the ... I think\nThey I don't know who they are I think now what they call themselves secrets society and let the group\nAnd I believe the Democrats are scared the hell out of wherever they are\nAnd the way they come across like Nancy Pelosi and its waters and all that [noise] I don't think in the Democrat Party instead of being a liberal party is scared to death of somebody\nIn line vice to you every American League it's where the cost to patients understand the constitution and you're a fan what our president is doing\nAll right thanks I appreciate you\nNine four one ... non for one Seventy four seven just to make sure I understood he was asking me a personal question in my both in sheep's clothing um I usually the best I could and then he tried to tell me how horrible it was that I said the president's bowling a China shop he didn't understand the metaphor that when I was saying was\nYou had Obama who was squeaky clean looking and made you feel good was all presidential and he sucked and now you're going to guy doesn't care comes in Knox things around and is doing right by the American people what did you say that well that's exactly what I said I made the comparison right here but I Do love you and I appreciate you\nAnd look out for those people over in Germany than a better controlling everybody let me say hello and welcome to a Peter who is in Pennsylvania but you know what's going on high\nA happy fixing the Tuesday\nOr a semi taco Tuesday but either way good\nOkay uh you know I Am certainly convinced a because they really don't know what to make of him Donald Trump could cure aids and the left would still hate him how\nI mean when you consider all the misdeeds of the Obama administration and\nLike I said to the girl to pick up the phone [noise] Hitler it must be made of Kevlar because charges don't stick to her that would ordinarily stick to someone like you or someone like me and it's horrible\nAnd she ... you're you're spot on on your analogy as far as the China shop and\nI don't think you dialed again understood it or didn't like it or something I don't know\nWell I mean the simple truth is is not a presidential he tells it like it is ... and ... you know what a lot of people feel better if it wasn't on Twitter that's what I like about him\nBecause he just flat out says this is you know he let you know and to many of these liberals dance around things\nAh and this guy's keeping his promises and on top of that uh you know four or eight years of Obama my insurance up a hundred and thirty two percent or ... or ... and everything else I feel a lot better with this man in here\nBecause I feel like\nWe're we're going to get it we're going to get it straight and he do remember a ... of the you I think it was he was at a un some type of un summit a pushed one of those leaders out of the way hey Americans here baby we are back on the\nInternational Louisiana law he was playing around or not but I Would I really like is when he was at breakfast at one morning and unless you're like about the butter the bagel and it looks at the guy says yeah you've been screwed my country and I'm done with that we're not going\nTo happen to be more no no we got to change it it's not right you know that it's not right I mean ... ... a guy the guy doesn't care about decorum doesn't care about political and you know that\nMakes you wince a little bit but at the same time he's doing what's right for you and me\nAnd for the American people and I can't argue with them\nI Can't argue abusive to remember that he sat down at breakfast and he said you're by you're helping to finances Russian oil my line you're buying oil from Russia was not your friend and here we are protecting your for all this money that's not right is that right that's not right now and the legacy media tried to light 'em up over it\nThey try to protect you were doing something bad when in fact he was saying we're protecting you were looking out for you why exactly would you go and give somebody else the benefit when that other person or that other entity could in fact be the bad guy\nAre that the economy of this country when crazy I mean it it it it's going through the roof are they the stock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred points I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote you have to realize the lies and deception\nThat some of the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K.\nYou know where every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're they're not working two or three jobs and that they're getting pay increases believe me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that in the midterms but again people have to go out and vote\nIs Eric Trump is sort of president Donald Trump also trumpeter national it was interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people got those or give us raises millions more people got ... a small businesses are adding\nEmployees instead of flushing the with Obamacare alone base last employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty employees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada said no way we're going to do it then they made a deal Mexico said no way we're gonna do it but they made a deal do you use it in a way we're going to do with them they made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the Bakken how weird is that\nWell how about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare rotating Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world ... keep your doctor you're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars healthcare costs you know flew through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the new prescription drug um\nLegislation that road has drastically reduce the\n... you look at a right to try to look at so many of these different efforts and\nYou know that's right because you know the politicians have been stuck in a mindset um their entire lives and then they don't care about actually governing they just want to keep themselves elected so their sales people that's not who he is I mean he's he's the one guy who's probably ever come into government who had the worst of life you know then then\nBefore he ... and there's usually I I\nThink he needed this job I go home and had he had the greatest life in the world he you know what I mean he was paid me the American dream and maybe still isn't so many ways\nHe didn't need the headache he didn't need the aggravation but he would open up the papers every single day and you'd see\nAmerica give us a hundred and fifty billion dollars to Iran a country that absolutely hate our guts right you know instead of spending it on a\nYou know our inner cities or educational systems or our military right that had fighter jets where they were going to museums to borrow parts because they didn't have enough parts for our our ... I mean it's crazy this is this is ... or giving a hundred and fifty billion dollars to a country that would love to see is wiped off the face of the earth\nAnd I see him shaking his head jail at seem shaking his head saying well what are we doing as a nation are these people absolutely\nInsane and they were and look how much he's accomplished in two years I mean look what he's accomplished a two year period of time it's unbelievable\nIt's or is there a drop drop international also of course the president or president Donald Trump\nOr in watching the germs approach it didn't look great for Republicans in fact it looked like the house is going to be easy win for the so called blue wave and the Senate was ... was was right on the border now it looks like we'll probably game three or four senators provided people do and vote and the house was up for grabs again\nI think that's got to be with Kavanaugh effect you've got to be but we were re motivated re energized on the right in traditional American values people by watching the lengths to deliver would go to do you think that can last two or three weeks or are we still okay there we have to keep on energizing people\nWell and you always have to energize people and people have to realize how important their vote is you have to get out you know if you believe in ... you have to get out you have though I mean it's just that simple even if he's not in the valley you have to get\nOut how to use about him though isn't it hurt it really ...\nIt of course it is of course it is because he doesn't have sent if he doesn't have the house it makes a lot tougher to get you know various things through and you know\nThe cabinet and look at it you know ... I mean whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty arrived at ... the Democrats we like it to me the exact opposite way only because it worked for them that specific day they want somebody be guilty until proven innocent I mean they tried to destroy somebody's family but it but aside from\nYou know the allegations aside from you know from from that side of the things I mean look at that first day in a cabinet got in there and nine thirty in the morning the first day he was set to testify you know on on on Capitol Hill America was tuned into TV they want to hear from you know ... you know potentially the next Supreme Court justice\nHe didn't get to say his first words until three thirty in the afternoon and gives you an Cory Booker Spartacus and all these people out there to grandstanding they were running for president from\nYou know from the stage it was unbelievable that's not what America is that's not what the confirmation process is of a Supreme Court justice you know we deserve so much better than this than than this nonsense and\nIn a way to get everything that my father um fights against I mean the the swamp these deep um it's so much deeper than I ever thought it was and\nYou know there are lashing out they're losing a lashing out a the Democrats don't stand for anything any more um other than you know the elimination of plastic straws and doubling your taxes which would put our country into a a\nYou know would put their country and to the second Great Depression um but they don't have a message they don't have any leadership and and and and we're winning I went into it were winning America's winning\nAmerican economy really evident in the past few weeks the your rights their platform is anything other than Trump and it's not going to work it's not resident gives gives Eric Trump or your diagnosis\nIn Houston next Monday which is going to be a great event\nI think ten thousand people will be there is no more standing outside I'm gonna try to get down there to uh let me ask you this though the criticism on the left and it's been criticism for two and a half three years now is that ... and and your father didn't like each other in the campaign trail but they're really not only are they very ... but the sound of the really similar guys\nWhen it comes to making promises and keeping them rise\nAnd this and has been great advocate of or a a my father in Washington and um you know I think I think that relationship I think the friendship has um as as as quite frankly really developed um pretty significantly\nYou know when when you come in and I remember my father was a you know a big risk that guy he didn't he didn't know any of these people you never rubbed shoulders with these people never spoke to them a cocktail parties I mean he was a he was an outsider and\nYou know a lot of times it takes it takes a while to get to know somebody and then you realize that you're you're fighting for the exact same thing and you know ... very very hard for so many things in my father's fought for and um he's been a big help and the mission to you know not to sound cheesy but make America great again which ... he's been doing them and whether\nIt be the tax reform whether it be cabinet or whether it be you know a hundred other things you know passing a massive amounts of of of of legislation take not so many issues that are so important I mean he's been a tremendous help and um I Know him personally and I've had personally and um you know and it was family and those two beautiful little daughter is a you know I Know his wife and um they're\nGood people um they're really good people hey do do do elections get contentious of course they do but they're good people and we uh we we need we need head we want people ... people have to get out people have to vote it's just a it's critically important\nIt's Eric ... you're going to ask you very quickly about too quick hits and well we will not spend much time on this but we kinda left before before we went on today I'm over the past two days Elizabeth Warren has been not not only not vindicated she's been proven to be completely long about our heritage and in fact the Cherokee Nation has asked her to be quiet now\nAnd then today because you're dead woman's lawsuit that that this was definitely Clifford in her her slimy\nA lawyer we're bringing today he called her horse race or something on Twitter when you're dead do stuff like that do you ever cringe a little bit or does it make you laugh at me what what what are you\nHe clearly won over over both Clifford and over ... I mean he's the winner in those little bottles that were off to the side when you see that going down what do you say because I mean it's blown up social media which blew my crazy\nYeah it is I mean I I'm I'm working as a media literally as we speak their picture of a duck and it says um you know it's obviously a parody of of of Elizabeth Warren but that's one ten twenty fourth bald eagle one\nOne thousand and twenty fourth and bald eagles on the phone funny little me most of us that that's the whole\nConversation today and it really is America elected a fighter ride aid and he's not one of these guys are a lot of people would say you know it takes to win it back I mean he's he's a fighter he's counterparts here when when\nSomebody does something that he thinks it's dishonest or unethical or um you know not right or you know what ... however you want to classify both of those individuals doing here listen to the war in the light about\nLied about our ancestry to try and get a job and to get into college it's disgusting I mean it's absolutely disgusting and you know it's it's it's ... we should expect so much more and people should be called out for this he had the Cherokee Nation came out a large it\nBut you know he's a counter punch your rights and and and and he's a fighter he is is that sometimes to his detriment probably but I don't know how you change somebody's DNA right if they're if they're a fighter and you want this country was missing a fighter for a long time we didn't have a fighter in the White House for a long long time\nAnd it's nice to have a fighter there again that's why we're winning these trade ... him so maybe this team ... doesn't maybe step on your feet once in a while to maybe trip you up on some last year but\nYou want that personality you want the person\nFeel that they're being taken advantage of where they're being used where they're being um and and it's fundamentally ingrained in his DNA and down and I think it's exactly what this country needs and and uh and I'm proud of and I'm proud of everything that he's accomplished and um he's awesome guy had a you know him but he's just an awesome guy and he's doing an

I've got no time at all and and I'm I'm going to give it to you but I've got like forty five seconds before the break and you make an Avon\nI can tell I'm a ... thing I'll tell you this right off the bat a number one a Trump\nWas the guy that nobody expected to win right hand or are we all expected to lose but he came through and he was the businessman that nobody expected because he was not a politician who is a businessman\nTo I Want to make a little shout out to my uh my my uh veterans friends\nI'm a veteran a Cold War veteran of the twenty six Yankee Infantry Division one twenty six signal battalion night and number three quickly\nIn this country is more Native American middle is with Warren turns out to be her so called vindication wasn't it actually made a fool out of herself\nIs that ... again don't live there is a big deal in Massachusetts right now is the media going nuts over this are they trying to help her out over this is this something that you'll talk about the debate coming up\nWell we hadn't talked about it during the entire campaign because to be honest with ya what her family said and what she believes is one thing right like the fact that she did take to minority hiring positions one at University of Pennsylvania and one at Harvard and she was the one who actually listed yourself as Native American international\nDirectory or that basically said that she was a ... a directory this for lawyers that college is that when a higher and look at you know\nWhen she got to University of Pennsylvania she insisted she made it a listed\nAs Native American but when she got to Harvard and got that job she delis yourself from that national directory as Native American so clearly when she was done using that it was a you know out in Port and do anymore and she never went to any Native American events on campus\nOr the fact is she never apologize for that the issue has been bothering people for a long time but he's the one who ended up yesterday opening Pandora's box and talking about it\nAnd I'm with you this was going to go away I mean the president calling her Pocahontas makes it look like ... she's a victim she complained about card the fact that she did a DNA test\nAnd put the results out there that proves that you and I are more Native American and she is and I'm not at all or ... that just doesn't make any sense she actually she look through your softball or through the president of softball or do you think that she really thought going in because she's not stupid do you think that she thought going into this was going to be\n... the victory for whoever Trump and possibly that get thrown the national stage to be the nominee of twenty twenty\nWhat is it a couple of things going I think she knew she had to try to put the issue aside somehow if she's going to let me say twenty twenty and\nAnd during the Kavanaugh hearings she was so desperate to make the national scene that she\nDocumented video and did a fundraising letter off of that she also did another fundraising letter off the uncorroborated or testimony of Dr Ford\nAll of this basically to try to make her name out in the national headlines at a time when she's competing with Kamala Harris and of course a center of Spartacus yeah I mean that's what the oil is for her to try to beat the far left progressive nominee for\nA two thousand and twenty and again in Massachusetts I\nFirst of all she has missed leading us for a long time you know she was on meet the press saying that she has no intention of running for president Joan yet said that many times and then all of a sudden she says I'm going to take a hard look at it we found out with ...\nLast weekend that basically she's been spending a lot of money half a million dollars on candidates\nAround the country raising over seven million dollars for candidates like she's of course been to Ohio recently of stumped for their candidate for governor ... in Pennsylvania in Oklahoma a few weekends ago while I was up in Lawrence dealing with people with the gas line explosions here in our state so she's been spending a considerable amount of time\nUh basically working on that presidential run and now I think people in Massachusetts are fully aware she has no intention of working for them show or spend the next two years if she's reelected traveling around the country a delivery nothing for us\nWhich is actually also admitted that she she would not commit to uh to to living on her term if he wins again she sort of I I Can't promise that all state senator for the next six years which is something that you will promise right\nRight exactly you know Massachusetts has some issues whether it's health care the fishing industry the opioid crisis\nAnd things I've been working on things I Know I can continue to work on a whereas she's been MIA and I think I'm right now it's really interesting there's a move afoot in the state to try to get Deval Patrick ... he's the former governor of Massachusetts has become a candidate\nFor a running and twenty twenty so it's interesting even the Democrats in Massachusetts seem to be trying to crowd her out of this field because I think it's clear at this point\nShe really can't avoid stepping in it anytime she is on the national stage whether it's calling law enforcement in criminal justice system racist whether it's saying that anybody who voted for Trump is part of a stew of racist I mean she really just has that same negative tone that Hillary Clinton had as well\nYeah I agree totally it's Jeff deal he's a Republican running against a Elizabeth Warren ... percent of you know in Massachusetts but you run a ... and that's a it's a pretty good place to go because\nThe Republicans were looking like it might be a bad November of ... the blue wave whatever that is as you mentioned ... but anyway uh the blue wave allegedly was gonna give them a house back the Senate was going to be very close might even give him the Senate now it looks like\nThey might gain three or four seats including you um ... comment on even those who were center center center left to live in Massachusetts did not like with the left just dude you're not hearing are you finding that to be the case are you feeling this the impact of Kavanaugh on on your ... to see or know\nYeah there's a lot of people in Massachusetts that feel that he was railroaded I'm the father of two daughters so of course I'd want them to be listening to if something happened but the fact is there was no corroborated evidence with a a basically an eleventh hour smear attempt a Dianne Feinstein her the senator the ranking member of the judiciary could have\nHad that uh those allegations investigated in private six weeks earlier she didn't she chose to drop it like a bombshell too embarrassed if a man and she ended up ruining two lives um the accuser any accused\nAnd then the process made the Senate look increasingly bad and I think that people are so sick and tired of Washington looking dysfunctional and they know that Warren is basically the tip of that dysfunctional spear um again because she takes such awful actions about going out there and basically saying presumption of innocence the cornerstone of our democracy that means nothing if you want to just\nMake sure that Republicans don't get their nominee for the Supreme Court or that partisanship doesn't work even in Massachusetts and I I'll say this Joe\nYou know we are the state where Ted Kennedy used to hold the same seat and even though he was the liberal lion of the Senate it would work with Republican presidents and Republican governors to deliver for our state people are sick and tired of war and not delivering and then becoming a national embarrassment as well\nI Wonder if Massachusetts is ready for somebody who's not for overwhelming regulation overwhelming grace of of government overwhelming taxation because to me when I figured Elizabeth Warren other than the Pocahontas stuff\nThe thing that comes to mind is she's basically your socialist she's basically far leftists that says if we control everything we're smart people they knew people will have a better life I don't want her to control me who does that really what it is it's sort of be the guy who believes\nTo believe that she's the smartest person in the room\n[laughter] well look I'm an Eagle Scout I always thought you'd have to anybody campground better than you found it I ran for office at the age of forty and now that the running for the Senate never thought I'd be doing this but it's something I think is calling it's not supposed to be a career and I'll tell you with Elizabeth Warren wanted the\nWar and wanting to nationalize business having government determine what your board of directors composition should be you know that's one step towards Venezuela and look at what's going on right there she wants health care to be run by government and\nIf you know if you like having a you know dialysis six months after you need it\nAt like England has sure go to that socialist healthcare where he like having hip replacements after five years\nGo to Canada but if you like having the United states where we actually get procedures done in a timely manner\nYou know we shouldn't have government running our health care\nAnd so you know one cannot have government run our lives enough in fact she wants to access to the point where uh I think on CNBC she said fifty percent would be the starting point up too and we don't know that feeling I guess the the host said Ninety percent might be too much and she agreed somewhere between fifty percent Ninety percent I think she would actually take a year income Joe\nI just doesn't make any sense artist Jeff deal he's a Republican running for US Senate against Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts I Wish it nothing but the best of them you've got to a debate coming on friday night or your kicks maps\nAnd that and let's talk again before the midterm I I I really hope to see that she turn red for the people of Massachusetts more importantly than a numbers game for me I just think that the people in Massachusetts are

I'll tell you I'll tell you Laura New Jersey people are smart and and they you know they recognize how poorly served\nBut the bigger issue really are are twofold one is affordability ...

I\nWas not impressed and I was a bit\nIt's just you know I've seen it's just it well of course now it's different shows now tells me\nA somber show where people die it's just not what it's about it's about you know talking about current issues and making you laugh about who we are as the people I mean is it it's to me it doesn't make any sense I did not watch it didn't DVR I Know what happens on it yeah did you see her tweet\nI did yeah come on that ...\nWas not the best part of the night [laughter] ... yeah\nSo we'll talk about that in earnest as as we go forward but I definitely want to talk about the enlisted I don't mind mixing it up with you if you think that somehow Ted Cruz's hypocritical for taking be indoors Smith of the president of the United states a guy that he battled up you know very vehemently they went out at man\nThey won at it and and I gotta tell ya I didn't mean both walked away with as many as they worry about what each said\nI think they walked away with a newfound respect or what is cutting back down\nAnd they work together on a lot of really important legislation that has been very good for the American people and protects assault listen I'll take those calls to don't be afraid about what to do it it it eight nine four one packs a day nine four one Seventy five or seven we go to the phone lines because I I really am interested in the early ... and especially those outside of Texas even\n... I Wonder exactly um what people are thinking about the the Lone Star state because I think that people have a certain image of who we are as as Texans and I think a lot of people are surprised that a guy like old war two was so far left and so far socialist is even in the ... okay did you hear that that he has been telling people that his mother was a lifelong Republican\nYeah I heard something about that earlier today yeah Beto\nO'Rourke has said his mother was a lifelong Republican who for the first time in her life will vote for a Democrat because he's running\nMhm yeah I mean that's a hard to research is it\n\nJust was mumbled it for ... to just come out there I guess I'm just wondering you know\nMa'am and then or ...\nOr is this is a works mother a lifelong Republican\n... voted for him\nNo I mean for for president in two thousand eighty that you voted for um\nProbably Obama\nKnow that you wait a second bad though says that she's only voted Democrat or I was only voted Republican her whole life and will now switch to vote Democrat just costs her son's running mhm so clearly to president who she voted for\nWell then I guess you have to know Republicans send them from McCain\nAide we're right the first the Muslim or non rug\nObama be forget I mean seriously that we really we do we really have to fact check his what he says about his own mother at least we argue against them I don't want to I Want to take him at his word but it turns out he's full of it so yeah I mean it's been reported by the blaze but in fact uh works mother voted for Barack Obama\nThat wasn't the funniest part of the answer because 'cause cruise actually said this last night the after partying it got a really big rousing laugh out of the crowd he was talking about the blind squirrel I'm\nMegan is wide yeah bad though you said that his daughter was is there something back to health applied score yeah go ahead\nWhat oh blind squirrel isn't that just isn't much of a joke you know not every once in a while I was like it was behind that was like a gimmick\nThing no last night that yes this really did happen and it's it's out there on the Internet somewhere I don't I don't have it we don't have video of it but there is video that somebody took and they posted it the first thing I said my name is Joe ... Joe ... but you can Kobe toe and that that's it [laughter] the crowd was I had him in the\nBottom of my ... had to do something that and and and I won't elaborate much but Ted Cruz didn't make reference to a ... stone last night in your party uh-huh okay\nSalem I'd ... I'd Lardy blood on the stove or somebody who's lived with his army definitely did he went there All right so let me go to the phone lines to see where you are on their side again many people watch those who can't vote for either one they don't live in the state or this was the top trained on Twitter for four hours straight\nAnd and it happened organically it wasn't it wasn't sponsored it wasn't promoted I'm and I'm interested in hearing what you say let me let me start in Texas however here's David Hi David what's going on\n[noise] Hey Joe thanks for taking my call ... so that you are real quick or you know the problem now is like at the at the last election you know I was a ... got a hallway\nAnd hindsight [laughter] you know and we're glad he didn't get the nomination 'cause I don't think he would've beat her\nI was a cruise got away and hindsight [laughter] you know and we're glad he didn't get the nomination 'cause I don't think he would have the her\nWithout the groundswell of the Donald Trump or you know totally had I mean he he pulled out people that close but not a cold out so in hindsight it was a good thing he didn't win the nomination now I think he has said that they get a lot of enemy\nWas the guy a lot of guys are going for that real conservative so I think he has a ... a good shot down Trump get does get a second term that are the better thing really aggravates me that guy you know I like to drink a beer with him one day just to get the\nToken ribs or something [laughter] I just a liar he just\nHe is he's misrepresenting who he is he he and he's told many many you know are just fall foods during this campaign if you've been listening to my show for a while you know David that I was a cruise guy from the beginning to\nAnd I'm ... and I did want to cruise to get the nomination once it was clear that he wasn't going to a hundred percent was going to support whoever the next person was going to be and that person became Donald Trump um I was never against Donald Trump candidates the I thought it was actually pretty cool but somebody who was not in politics could could do so well\nAnd it was close man I mean Ted did very very well I mean think about it he was second place it's almost got the nomination but I agree with your your assessment I think that you needed Donald Trump to beat Hillary Clinton needed somebody who is going to fight going to roll it sleeves up and not\nCare whatsoever about what the establishment or the or the historic worthy\nUm traditional politic a politician looked like he wanted to come in and say whatever you had to say to win whatever liberal jihad he would mix\nAnd and I think you're right he's the right guy at the right time it does crews have a chance in in in ah twenty twenty four I think he does other you certainly right up there\nI I Hope he makes it in one last thing like you know at all I got from it and it got or or whether he says yeah better than real popular aims to get\nPeople on the border he's from the border town and he says you know he's just using that in the ... right you know it's real and you you said Robert scientists I think we are in that name often I get a kick out of your taco an adult and the cash ... say [laughter]\nI'll just say one thing I I don't know when\nI go that's what I'm saying now that was good that was good I better be away so so here's the thing with um with O'Rourke\nShe wrote that ... you can correct me if I'm wrong if I ever speak out a term when it comes to an actual news item in actual fact\nCorrect me if I'm wrong they're going to court my opinion not to be a different thing but you can as well as you were good friends but when ... wrote that that a review of the play when he was in high school right after high school whatever it was a late teenagers Seventeen or Eighteen years old\nHe wrote it and when he objectify women talking about their butts talking about their boobs\nOne name that he uses a byline\nWas it Robert Francis I don't remember it was Robert O'Rourke okay he wrote it as Robert ...\nLet me ask you something if your name is so Beto back though if that's your name and that's the name you go by at forty something years old because you've only always been known as that name\nAnd if it's such a your name but it needs to be on the ballot when you run for election something is official as wanting to be a U.S senator why wasn't it your name when you wrote some stupid article when you're in high school college\nIt's a good question I don't know\nI think it's a valid question and I I Would like for somebody to ask him that question when did you become ... full time when did that happen\nHe's always been known as the look here's a picture of they're wearing a sweater with his\nBeta fulltime when did that happen\nNo he's always been known as the look here's a picture of him wearing a sweater what's his name on the front side of a sweater which I've never seen before ever I mean seriously ... Gary you and I've talked about this I was a\nDumb into the picture yeah but but even I didn't have my neighbor's front of my shirt [laughter] okay I didn't know that Adam that may be on the back need maybe a new born shirt maybe on a Jersey but as your last name in the back of your shirt or anything right right\nOkay\nHey Casey forgets his name or in case the teacher forgets what to call and let me write this on the front of the shirt man yeah yeah I got edited nine for one pack Joe ... dot com back out to Minnesota see what's going on high\nWell hey there they love the show every day for all that you are a lot of snow this man I was just wondering if there's any possibility that they could get fact checkers on these debates it seems like if they had a panel for people or something setting off on the side and when\nUh the people debating say no no no that's all wrong with that for a fact checkers could go and\nLook up about the truth as and popping up on the side of our TV screen so we don't have to wait for the next day four papers that come out and in fact check everything and then people don't see it because they don't read the paper or read the news every day or hear the news\nI think it's actually a great idea I mean here's a great idea I just don't know I mean as fast as the Internet I guess you could get you you could get some sort of a fact checking going during the debate but would it take away from what they're actually saying and and do the moderators do it or do you have people like ... like they had\nA uh Internet bank last night of a bunch of people sitting there actually taking suggestions from the Internet in question for the Internet so I guess you could fact check it that fast\nI mean but then what do you do the moderator finds out that a worker Cruz just said something wrong didn't invent circle back and say we just that are fact checking it turns out you did vote that way or or what are you saying that that uh well uh I don't know\nMaybe it would be interesting I think the debate would have to be longer don't ya\nYeah the yeah I suppose they'd have to get more time that's why at first I was thinking that they just pop it up on the side of the screen that no this is actually what it is and then let them face the consequences the next day and have that be in the newspaper instead of instead of them fact checking out the next day and then people don't see it anyway\nSo instead of making it apart and we had a little debate where the moderators would then go back to what you just put it up on the side of the screen or in the bottom of the screen saying a ... vote was this way or crews did say that\nThat was one thought that I had I thought yeah though to say what happened they'd have to talk about it\nWell I I don't I don't know that and I appreciate you thank you I don't think that they would agree to it I didn't cruise probably would agree with every two or three days by reading that he's ever said and done um\nBut but when it comes to work I don't see in the green to talk about you know to to accepting a fact checking that his mother didn't vote that way in fact\nAccepting the fact checking that in fact he did vote that way in the barrel of oil fact checking like when he says look we don't need a wall look at all Paso I mean the fact checkers say a there is a wall or offense in El Paso so yeah I mean I think that it would be cool I Would do would you be open to that carry\nI think I I think that's very interesting and as far as you know now that the voting in the in the oil and then ten dollar taxi wanted and Ted Cruz said no oh it's getting on my website it would've been really nice to spend money and they were fact checking during the debate and before the debate was over\nGoing back to work and saying hey we did our homework now what might be happy to say because apparently right in that way I Would really like her that answer from him\nWell the weird thing is why would\nExactly right in that way I Would really like her that answer from him\nWell the weird thing is why would he used that as the example of calling Ted Cruz a liar win a war can self knows the way he voted\nFor now I now have rattled by God and I think that listen I think\nThat he was he was advised by the whatever the hell it is that's a ... um call him a liar at some point bring apply in Ted that the president said oh by the way also I Wonder if those across the nation today really believe or work when he says I Can't wait to work with the president on this that and the other\nHere's a guy that has promised to impeach the president should he become elected to US Senate\nWhat he wants to work with the president and he's using the president's words against Ted Cruz\nVery odd to me all these years very strange editing nine four one package Joe packs dot com let's expanded a symbol take calls on this to let's expand it how would you make the debate system better I mean obviously we're better than to guy standing on the stump in a park okay that's so we've been improved their um", "station": "KQTH", "city": "Tucson", "locations": [["Dennis", -78.24444, 166.16667], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Mexico",

trend last night because a lot of national money has been with this way [noise] thirty eight million dollars\nTo work alone in a way it was just an odd debate to me it was an odd debate for him I just felt like he didn't do well at all and then I see all these news headlines today was ... de la Cruz was savaged by O'Rourke no no he wasn't\nNot even a little bit I mean and it's so odd that I think they think if they reported that way it'll just be told that way\nI actually went to the guy today wrote that Savage to him I said what do you do some guy it'd be independent which I think is in in oc carry mhm and billionaire and the u._k. yeah\nHe he's the one the road or Savage cruised by calling the lion dead\nHe called them lying dead when he got some big exactly right the person who is Locke

for a fifty dollar procedure that is what Obamacare is doing it's actually running great doctors out of the business you know that\nNo I agree with you and that's the documentation standards that are

with them for the seat two years ago not really sure why she's getting another another shot to be I guess you can keep on going I guess I guess you'd want to try and I guess but I'm pretty interesting\nI I don't I've never heard of this person the woman that he's running against but that doesn't mean anything I don't I don't live in Minnesota maybe maybe she's a big deal in Minnesota but there was a video that age Jason Lewis supporter has put together um pretty much asking who this person is\n[noise] but what the\n... regular no\nTown and correct\nWant to why you're out\nSalmon on this country into a constitutional crisis we haven't seen and we're certainly not willing to go there most people in my district don't want to go there they want the government get results not write this down\nUm and so this is a very crucial midterm I don't think people realize well actually I think they're starting to realize you thanks to people like you know what they care\nI'm with you it's Congressman Jason Lewis district to Republican the great state of Minnesota he's running for reelection ... was the challenger she challenged him two years ago last um here's the thing\nI looked and I can't really see where she's demanded you on the issues\nAnd if we go through the history of what you've accomplished in just two years we're talking about an economy is booming like crazy lower taxes for every Minnesotan everybody who's listening who pays taxes corporate taxes lowered so we can build new jobs people getting bonuses and raises that they never expected or because of your work and because of the work of president Donald Trump\nDo people understand exactly how good it is ... and here's the second part of it is there a fear in your mind Jason that\nPeople get fat and happy as you listened things are going great I'm not going to rock the boat and go vote\nI think up until the Kavanaugh hearings when people saw the debt almost the political depravity of what some of these folks are willing to go right I I think that might have been true I Do think people on our side\nAre are realizing just how crucial this mid term is but you still got to get out and vote and you're quite right about our accomplishments is not only getting the economy going again at four four and a half percent at six percent increase in ... after tax take home pay right it's about current technical education which I've let on I got a bill passed that includes our language in it\nIt's about work in a criminal justice reform it's\nAbout reforming the metropolitan counseling which here in Minnesota is on a buck and citizens in the second district know all about that\nBut my opponent doesn't want to take a stand on anything least about Medicare for all socialized medicine least of all sanctuary cities and building a border wall even though she's taking money from Christian ... right at least of all things she's going to impeach and vote for Nancy Pelosi\nSo what they're going to do jog guarantee it it will find more old radio clips they can throw out there because they are standing for nothing they have NO PLAN except to attack and smear\nWell how did things change should she God Forbid win the race I mean the people who are listening and you know highly rated we are no keep you okay and everyone else in Minnesota people are listening closely right now how bad could things get if the the left does in fact when the house if you're on seed in which I don't think should happen\nWell look if the if the Democrats take over the house and my opponent is elected and vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker what you will have given that the tens of thousands of dollars Pelosi now she she goes out at another below sea fundraiser this cycle you are so that will happen\nYou will see the country grind to a halt if you think the Kavanaugh hearings were good for America you'll love of the house under Nancy Pelosi and Angie crate\nThat as a fat and that's what's on the ballot in November it's as simple as that you want chaos you want resistance you aren't riots or do you want results\nAnd and those are all great questions and you're actually you are absolutely spot on I've been calling us the Kevin I'll bounce um\nFort unfortunately it happened for him and his family end unfortunately it happen for for for ... before she was used as much as he would use when Spartacus as things like it doesn't really matter at this point if he's innocent or guilty we just have to stop the Americans on both sides including those who are center left\nSaid enough I can vote for these people I don't like what just happened that it happened too far away though because that that will be four weeks out when we finally get to the election are people going to be motivated\nI Hope they do sometimes it takes a while for the stuff to sink in you know but certainly walk some folks up your right but I think more than anything else the cabin I hearing or a microcosm of of quite frankly these liberal tactics going back for years and years\nBut I think more than anything else the cabinet are you hearing or a microcosm of of quite frankly these liberal tactics going back for years and years and years for the migration twenty sixteen\nWe we just people knew Jason Law as well as they listen to me for two decades on the radio like they listen to you and when these attacks almost eight million dollars worth of attacks taking my worked out of context came out they said\nI mean that's how the Jason we know yeah and I won I Won the race well now they've been lifted the national media and anybody they can find the national media has become the opposition research arm of the Democratic party's you know and now they're trying to regurgitate that because that's the only play book they've got\nIt can't afford to come out and say hey I'm for sanctuary cities and it gets border security I'm for socialized medicine that will end Medicare as we know and then kick people out there or if they can't they get 'em or nasty below the speaker so we can have a constitutional impeachment crisis and I'm for packing the Supreme Court right I Can't say that so they attack\nAnd take worked out of context and and ... anything they can find and that the bankruptcy the allergies\nIt is a Congressman Jason Lewis this or this or to Republican or a state of Minnesota I Hope you vote for him on on election day coming up the returns zero November six I'm ... you're right and ... it's actually the same story but we see here in Texas where I Am with this guy Robert Francis awoke he's calling himself Beto\nHe's acting like he's Hispanic use fourth generation Irish nothing wrong with being an Irish but but I mean why why pretend you're something else but he hasn't said anything\nAnd when he's called he got it all about identity politics\nExactly well it's about identity politics I'm Hispanic Robert Kennedy which makes no sense he's not as ... I also in bringing flowers in rainbows and squirrels\nAnd he's not saying anything other than hoping changing let's work together well he or impeachment while he's for abolishing ice while he's against a border wall I mean we have down at least for raising your taxes is that exactly who you're dealing with ... and it was nice it she not seeing any of those things\nAnd that's precisely how do you take money from Kirsten Gillibrand is leading the charge for abolishing eyes yeah and then saying well I I really haven't taken a position on that how do you say I Want to work towards a single payer system and then say well but I wouldn't vote for the current plan\n... it's just that you watch a lot I don't think we're so they don't have to take a position that's unpopular and so they just attack and by the way all the while raising record amounts of money the likes of which no political cyclists ever seen right wow they run with Citizens United\nPlastered all over their their their bumper stickers how you run out of getting money out of politics and set record after record in fundraising for special interests\nHave you guys debated at all\nYeah we've already got one in the can it'll be airing next week and the other one or two more um but\nAre you going to be looked at her and take a position or not they're going to say she were\nI think I think the one we've already take Joe I think people will uh will see that she doesn't want to take a position\nBecause and and that's what people need to see we need to make sure that we expose the Web look if she's really taking positions that you really believes in these things and people in Minnesota want to vote for that which would be ridiculous you know that's fair it's not fair to lie about it get into office and become Nancy Pelosi on steroids that doesn't make sense\nWhen she first decided to run Jon Klein was in the seat before he retired yeah and she said one of the reasons he wanted to run because Klein opposed the Obama amnesty plant\nAnd that was just untenable for that now she's only been out of course right so it's just it it is you know I'm just going to ride the blue wave and not take a position that I'll vote for Nancy Pelosi I'll abolish ice I'll adopt sanctuary cities are socialized medicine once I get there but you're not going to know it then it sort of like you know Obamacare will know what when we read it\nIt is a Jason Lewis I use a representative district to Republican the great state of Minnesota before I let you go I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up the Keith Ellison wise\nIt is a Jason Lewis I use a representative district and Republican the great state of Minnesota before I let you go I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up the Keith Ellison why is this guy even stay on the ticket afterward Kavanaugh was used accused of and there was no corroboration there was no proven fact I walked away saying it didn't happen\nAnd now we she Keith Ellison whose girlfriend one or former girlfriend who one would imagine agreed with him politically is out there showing pictures of her having been pummeled and this only happened a couple of years ago how is this guy in the running and might possibly become the top law enforcement officer in the state of Minnesota helped me out here\n... why have my opponent not told him to resign as she takes it all publicly on him of course not of course that she didn't take a position on Al Franken that's ridiculous and call ... took his money that had to give it back yeah took money from Garrison Keillor or lead to resign over ... charges\nCampaign with a state senator duck show on who had to resign over sexual harassment shark campaigns are key Ellison actions speak louder than words Joe and if they if if the Democrats aren't I Want to talk about sexual harassment and the serious nature of it you look at the actions versus work and it's really astounding\nI was a big fan when you were on the radio I'm certainly a big fan of you know in Congress and I want you to stay in Congress it's Congressman Jason Lewis district to Republican the great state of Minnesota vote for him on the on November sick in the mid term Jason

like someone's getting I'm getting that done here welcome\nThank you for having me I I Would agree with everything you just said I'm so what happened is uh I I wouldn't do a local bar restaurant um they have a big\nBanquet center and I went to see if they would be interested in letting us rent that whatever for a event to have all the statewide candidates they're like a meet and greet type thing uh when I walked in someone recognized me and asked the campaign was going and\nThen people just kind of circled around I guess [noise] um [noise] one young man was asking me ... ... policy questions and then told me about himself he ended up on a yard sign so we I gave him one and then another gentleman entered the conversation and ... it was a back and forth\nSeem any thing to be worried about the ... at the time I someone said something to my right and I was talking to that gal over there and the next thing I knew he he yelled out a political statement was something to that effect do you believe in people don't give a belief about the middle class and he just sucker punch me I didn't see a comment\nAnd I was sitting hired ... chair and I went flying back and once my head hit the ground that was all I remember\nOh my gosh that and I can tell you it was a very big guy\nDid or did he\nGet out for a hundred and um they did catch up with them two days later I'm found them he basically told them that are ... the ... the deputy asked them whether or not I said or did anything to provoke him and his answer was no\n... the deputy asked them did you give them any warning prior that you were going to hit him his answer was no and then when they did but he asked him do you know where you had them and he said yeah right and right now\nSo is he arrested for assault\nThey had been arrested and charged him yet they're waiting for the uh to determine the level of a charger waiting for the medical report as well as the video surveillance\nAnd you're obviously going to testify

the bruises on my body and um my eyes which was you know the white uh my I was like had to I don't know it was all red mhm and uh now now it's the concussion side I've learned that the sun is not my friend\nOh my goodness Shane or any ... sorry go ahead ... ...\nThe biggest thing is that what I mean the there's the civility seems to be gone and and I mean\nI I and I didn't get the sense that we weren't uh like minded going into it I guess are up until that point but it's just you know wail somebody in the head and send them flying is is that like I\nSaid before it's not something I was signing up for\nWell Shane ah first of all the left is trying to\nIntimidate good Americans like you've from running for office they're trying to frighten people scare them and if that doesn't work physically attacked them out of a race physically prevent you from running and this is being encouraged\nBy the Democrats at the highest levels even those who claim over not for violence of course we're not for violence than ... where are they why are they supporting this caravan approaching the U.S border\nThat is lawlessness complete and utter lawlessness they embrace lawlessness if the ends are in their minds justified noble\nSo that means are justified excuse me at the end is noble and the end is electing Democrats or you can bring more of a a social spending framework enforce that on the American people of all the goals of of of more of a democratic socialist approach to governance\nIf those are noble goals and you can get there by any means necessary including a sucker punch of someone that gives them a concussion and messes up there by\nA and this is why conservatives Republicans of all backgrounds you must ensure that these people are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law I Would file a civil suit against him a and I would I Would I Would move on that stuff I Would sue him\nFor what he did and I hope you I Hope you do that you know anything about his background\nI I really don't um I I I've heard a few things that I'm a I guess they some easing the trades of some sort that is what I've learned but beyond that I don't really know much about them ... or you know he was a fairly big guy to be on that we\nHave Democrats are in the state spoken out against us\nThat you know I I actually know so like both of our senators are Democrats and neither one of them to my knowledge as of yesterday anyway had come out and publicly denounced it um [noise] I Will say that my Congressman Tom emmer he did call me as soon as you heard about it\nWas the first time they've ever called me but it and you know give me as a condolence has the support and all that I was you know but but\nOther than you know none of none of our representation or higher up people have come out and said that to the to the last I looked at me like imagine if you would be the motor that the thing that is the norm now it just you know go out and like you said getting their faith kicking when they're down with a bit of comments or I got\nTore up for using that exact lining up Facebook response of calling out the comments from Hillary and Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and and if somebody actually starting a local publication as my understanding that how would how would their their comments have any influence in rural Minnesota\nI don't know if they don't think we don't have a radio and TV here\n[laughter] yeah so Eric Holder if they go low we kick 'em Hillary Clinton if they go low we hit harder or whatever it is she sent a right yeah well it of course\nThe low we kept come Hillary Clinton if they go low we hit harder or whatever it is she sent\nA right yeah well it of course it doesn't affect I mean I don't know about this guy I don't know what his deal is but of course it has an effect\nAnd it's meant to intimidate it is a type of political intimidation and its physical intimidation and up to the point of committing crimes\nBut again they they they attempt to dehumanize entire groups of people like if you're a conservative in Minnesota and you run for office and you and you call it as it is they have to call you a racist you they have to say that you're anti women\nAre and you might imagine what they would have done Shane if a a liberal female Muslim candidate for instance\nUh was brutalized or hit by someone else a woman as let's say a concert or just give the gender that is a conservative woman hitter said you don't you're not you're not representing my interests you imagine\nAnd I wouldn't mind you know first ones to I'd be the first one out there to condemn that physical absolutely tax\nWell I could say I certainly wouldn't wish this upon anybody I don't know and and and you know I grew up my mom was extremely liberal my entire life my dad was a totally opposite very conservative they were thought about it\nIn fact that they would tease each other you know let's go Catholic voters vote I mean it's I guess it ... this doesn't need to be everybody's everything where you don't agree with me I it's it's all out just throw down\nBattles it says\nIt's a it's a sad place when we become actually\nA shame how does your race look\nA in theory I'm going to Seventy thirty district so conservative speaking so it's a it's a strong Republican district that with the unfortunate part is we do have an independent that sought the GOP endorsement and rented an independent but by the time that\nThe the downside to this is a I ... the doctors have told me or you got to lay low you have no idea what this is I Try to tell them I only have three weeks a campaign left and I ...

polo for the car you know vehicle that looks like that are writers\nYou know an armed robbery ... you know so to educate the community educate the people educate them from high school ... wonderful\nUm well it's because cops are human beings and and and all they want to do is have you know ... ... an interaction most often write a traffic stop is more of an education than anything else
