J. B. shore twenty eight past the hour [noise]\nHi I'm ... with the ... of the day you know frequently people ask me war and we looked to adopt the dog we're really looking for a puppy or a kitten\nAnd very often I explain to them that they should really be thinking we're re thinking about possibly adopting an older dog or cat\nYou know you get what you see when you adopt and all that you know what they look like how big they are going to be an older pets generally settled and easy and bond ... with their new family many older pets have already experienced parts of life like riding in a car going to the vet walk you're on a leash or just happy\nTo be with you all the pets no you save their lives and and pay you back every day for the record bears and that tackling their second third or fourth chance when you adopt older pet you can a race they are packed unpleasant experiences my loving and caring for them older pets grade the same sense of belonging and need to love that all living things to do something\nIf you think about adding a pep your family next time you go to the shelter rescue humane society check out some of the older dogs and cats they make great great pets and I promise you they will thank you every day for saving their lives ...\nI'm not all of a trauma diary of low scheme diary I\nBrush off again I don't get it is there something wrong with the way I waive although although rent that little town acknowledge me I'm friendly I get everyone peace of mind when they protect their homes their progressive jumping for joy when I Walk by\nIs terrible all of that as bad as we should words have power I understand that they do but what you're hearing right now is a narrative about people who\nI protect people's rights for hate speech if you want to say that you hate so and so I'm going to go out there and fight for you because we live in a country where our speech is protected and what's being done now if you listened very carefully you listen and very quiet you can listen\nThat they're trying to say and this is the news media narrative that is being fun\nThat words are going to now influence people's behavior and what slippery slope does that bring it down and brings it down to the limitations of speech and you know once we started doing that we lose who we are as the country and we can not be intimidated by these crazy people we have\nTo fight them and we have to prosecute them hard and I think Trump calling for the death penalty on the Senate God killer is absolutely appropriate absolutely\nSo here's the thing that happens Virginia Byrd comes to my mind as I listen to you that the the thing that shuts these\nOutfits down first of all this guy raised about a million bucks on a some kind of a I think it was a goal for me page last year but that means that there are people who were following him that I agree with the border\nGuy a guy the shooter or the the creator of the when the creator of the website and I'm not talking about the shooter I'm Talking about the website\nSo uh but the other side of the ...\nThe shooter or that the creator of the creator of the website and I'm not talking about the shooter I'm Talking with a website\nSo uh but the other side of the coin is that if you really feel strongly about this you don't have to you don't have to you're not required to do business with somebody like this if you don't agree with that might not shutting them down just don't do business like a radio program or TV program or whatever you don't like it don't buy the book\nThat's it period not somebody artificially shutting somebody that I did do something [noise]\nThat um I Hope will be instructive for a couple of minutes I looked at some stats now is I'm just talking to you and I actually did this last night a couple of weekends ago or if you go back through the four largest\nProblems we've had with shootouts the last maybe months let's take the last month New York city not one single shooting in the entire city for the past three Friday Saturday Sunday nights have you compare that to the\nThe last two three four weeks and in Memphis\nWe're about one tenth of the number of people live is in New York seven people were shot and killed\nAll seven of the victims were men six of the dead were between the ages of twenty three and forty nine and then you look at Chicago over the same weekends Seventy two people shot\nIn Chicago in that same period so how come should ups in carnage in Memphis how come should ups and carnage in Chicago and how come no shoot ups in New York a lot of people will point to the fact\nThat there are um the police are better in New York uh there is not as much gun allowance I don't know what\nThe law is or what the rules are the New York have one way in and one way out and that's why you don't the school in New York New York ... in video at least\nRight so I mean certainly did we a deadly weekends are not exclusive to Chicago in Memphis you can see that some things I Baltimore and a couple of weeks ago didn't they have in September a shootout in Baltimore where a number of people got killed\n'em but the this that the weather in New York City as of his training for police or whether it has the same as you suggested these public buildings one way and in one way out whether they'd curbs of it certainly is worth thinking about for me anyway why it is there's such a difference\nIs there is solution to gun violence and the New York has it why isn't it being replicated is the question from someone who are pulled the records of these cities back to Nineteen Ninety six and looked at the shootout and the biggest change\nHappened when Bloomberg was mayor of New York the rules changed in New York or at least more action the focus of the city to make things like you just suggested a reality make it safer not lots of noise about their early just do it\nWhatever it is is that you see this is what you get the blow hards who want to talk about gun control of the blow hards you say it's this or they say that it's that it's just talk action action action\nAnd they have action in New York\nThey've made it safer in New York police presence whatever it is so why can't these other cities by God Chicago is an outrage\nIt really is it's become a national joke 'cause it's so violent there but we are in a vat we have a valley I mean a violent society by the honest\n'cause it's so violent there\nBut we ... we have about ... I mean a violent society by a streak in us but\nNew York has dealt with it and I think a lot of people could learn from it I don't know about Los Angeles I don't remember much I don't hear even though I'm they're part of the I don't know that there's a whole lot of violence in Los Angeles I Can't put my finger on anything crazy lately is their Jennifer\n[noise] there's always violent but it's what I mean you know the violin no I think there is but you know there's a month and drugs and gangs and all the stuff that I think you see in a big city and I got it for sure Mm [noise]\nAlright well something to think about it anyway risk factors of living in a big city speaking of risk factors risk factors for hepatitis C include being fifty three to Seventy three years old is you know that\nHaving had a blood transfusion or organ transplant for Nineteen Ninety two it's time to learn more facts\nDid you know chronic hepatitis C can cause liver damage and lead to liver failure in fact it's the number one cause of liver transplants and the leading cause of liver cancer Hi\nI'm senator Nancy Todd from Colorado and board chair of women in government and I'd like to recognize this October as liberal awareness month today there are options available to help treat hepatitis C if you think you have hepatitis C visit a doctor to get tested and keep your liver healthy for more visit women and government dot org\nCentral tenant of the American dream as always been that the next generation would do better than the one before it\nEducation was the essential key because ...

spirit has and I wind up getting called once it gets to daddy you know when when when the husband and the family winds up feeling something and says okay that crazy what's going on over here yeah call you a psychic friend\nUm that's when I get called but I've been doing a lot of clearing out uh recently a lot of negativity begets negativity so you've got all of that going on all over the United states in the world and it actually brings them out even more so because they're mostly negative they're stuck there are they're frustrated\nThey're angry\nOr they're resentful right and misery enjoys company so they look for everybody else's miserable too so that's why I'm more of a coming out now\nI'm a ... because it is a ... game and the celebration of them with thinking about them so it brings into the surface and especially the way we celebrate Halloween with ghosts and ghouls right the\nRise silly or frankly your there's much more to this is you're pointing out I'm I'm not against having a good time I think Halloween the way we celebrated his just plain stupid or there are as you pointed out the all Hallows eve or the significance of people who are stuck\nHere uh and so I thought perhaps we ought to talk about what happens when somebody from the other side is trying to\nTouch into us a lot of people deny that they have psychic abilities the psyche connection even though I think you and I were on the same page would agree that we all have it it's tapping into it it's understanding it's it's letting it come in there's so much here\nAround Vincent that people don't want to admit to them so that even the simplest of contacts the shiver that you get in your shoulder when somebody actually is communique that's a communication and a lot of people that you know I just got chilly you know I\nThat's why they want to talk themselves out of it so that everybody knows without into wishing we wouldn't even be able to survive so intuition and psychic and this is the exact same thing 'cause you tapping into the same place\nBut has his psychic I have learned to open the doorway and hear a little bit more\nSo yes it and and those in spirit\nThey're just as much as we missed them they miss us they want to talk with us because they know what they've left behind whether they've left behind some mistakes are lower choices that they made or even some abuse\nRight they want to help us fix that they want to help us get through our lives and understand ourselves even more so because when you get to the other side you see the big picture and you're like smacking yourself in the head going oh my gosh I should add a V. eight um and and you've got all this disappointment than what you've left behind\nSo they're around this constantly we smell them okay that's interesting because I get a lot of clients as well as my self uh that will smell the aroma of past love what I mean my father had a distinct\nOdor and cologne that he always war and when I when I ... every so often I Will get a whiff of it and I don't deny it I don't say oh that's strange ah nah that's just my imagination I figure if it's in my head I smell it he must be there so I say hello to him\nI doesn't always have something necessary the said to me but with others there's always a comforting feeling there's always a a a this trying to get some information and the person starts feeling more gut feelings or whisper in the year\nMany times people are driving or they're doing something and they get distracted and at the last minute something makes\nMany times people are driving or they're doing something and they get distracted and at the last minute something makes them turn their heads and it's a good thing they did because they kept from hurting somebody else or running into somebody that's usually the whisper in our era going look\nKnow and and sometimes when we're not thinking about it we do we go and look you know and and then we go away why did I Do that okay never mind well thank goodness I did\nWell in your gut is very important I Am curious as to I I ask this of people who I Do a um\nA focus on this sort of thing every week on a program called your hidden power\nAnd the fact that people realize they have this thing the development sort of thing and they can use this sort of thing I Wonder and I often ask this how do you turn it off like you and I am and your conversation now\nHave you dug into me can you feel something for me and do you not want to we just want to have a conversation here but can you help yourself\nFrom figuring out what the person is all about that you're talking to whether it's here maybe in the grocery store you're driving and you'll get somebody to your left is going down the street or where does it stop and where does it begin\nA that's an excellent question and there's too many psychic medium to turn around and say I can't control this thing and think it's a gift that you can't control it actually if you can't control this thing you also can't control your life\nAh ... our brain has the filtration system naturally so you're not\nPaying attention to all the stimuli that's coming in at once your vision you're hearing your taste your smell your feeling you're not doing that all at once you usually do two of the time because it was be an an an overwhelming amount that stimulation coming into you well it's the same with the psychic sense\nAnd you can actually consciously and knowingly keep it off so rather than me turning it off like right now okay I'm getting on the phone with\nWith Doug I don't want to tap into him I don't have to do that I'm automatically off until I open it up ... and when I open it up the difference is I'm paying attention then\nTo another sense so just like you can I Want you to pay attention to what you're smelling right now you can direct all your focus to your smell sense I Want you to pay attention to what you're hearing right now\nAnd you can pay attention to that it's not that all of a sudden you go blind and you go um if you don't feel anything else but what you're doing is you're just paying attention\nThat's exactly what I Do with my sense is I pay attention to it and listen we don't sit and listen enough\nAs long as your brain is chattering you can't hear the intuition or feel of a gut feeling so you'll have to sit quietly what is that what is that that I'm feeling old I Need to go over here that today I'll make an appointment and I'll and I'll call the doctor and I'll go there you know it today not disappointment that so\nYou're absolutely right listening to the gut feeling is vital\nMouth matter of just focusing on it so no I did not reading you or anybody else until I Want to\nOkay so here's let me just go back to what you said a moment or two ago and I give you an example but I I Want people not to be in denial and they have the same experience yesterday I was driving I have a farm\nIn addition to being a broadcaster I'm a farmer and I was delivering hey a to a fellow in a different part of the state and I had actually it was driving all day long they're delivering picking up and doing that sort of thing and I as I'm driving along I my dog with me\nOn a different part of the state and I had actually it was driving all day long they're delivering picking up and doing that sort of thing and I as I'm driving along I my dog with me and I'm listening to the radio\nAnd it's not the first time it happens frequently but somebody came in to my mind into my thoughts and I felt the president we didn't have a long conversation but we had a conversation out some people would say a staff and urine nuts\nNow I have this happened to me frequently with people but it's more as you said because I'm thinking about it I'm open to it I had a conversation with my former wife\nThat lasted almost two hours and the drive that I took a month or so ago I've had people that were in my life\nThat I wanted to talk to them they just start talking to you and I feel like they're they're I Wonder if that's part of the vibration can you attract people in Vincent if you want to help\nI Will tell you this Doug about you you're an extremely sensitive person because of the work you do and because of even the show you are more open you're taking a spiritual journey in your life in general that opens your heart and the waves and the channels automatically\nSo now it it's a great time what do we do in the car where we're usually very quiet or listening to the radio or very\nThoughtful and thinking of all of these things so you kind of open to it and you accepted so as soon as you get the feeling of it\nYou could have gotten in your own way and then the message way by turning around and going out yeah but thinking about how the other day it yet is to let me turn this station on the radio you know and you could have been ignored it but you didn't you went with the flow you went with it and then the conversation was able to take place but\nYes that's the way it can happen for many people are now don't get me wrong it doesn't mean that I don't feel my mother or I don't feel other deceased loved ones coming intimate no\nI it it could be at any time during the day that I get a sense or feeling from somebody it's when I'm with other people that I can I'm On the control that I'm not feeling them

I'm sure because it's relatively new gathered I yeah but what I Would do is just try to estimate\nUm so if there was a ... year but I Do is because it's relatively new guy that I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in his budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand dollar to duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA\nA whatever a line in your budget\nFor medical expands ongoing chronic medical and just call you call it chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every\n'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really I think you're right now on\nWhat I I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we ... we got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem\nWhere I got into that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that\nI make I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition and actually switched jobs had more functionality\nOn some in a fee for service division as opposed to a salary position mhm and I make

very late I pay nine Seventy five or rent it give us a lot um\nAnd I do that from help from my\n... and what is the nature of the debt student loan\nBig fat is everything credit card I also because they can hear it I was trying to ... stick thing mhm on medical and then the student loan to that is going to cut it out and it had like a total of six speak out\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that's food pantry not eating you know not eating out friday and you're paying your life your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food shoulder clothing and transportation utilities\nThe eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson and what's the necessity necessity is only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities in the New York is about end of the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nThe end of the debt as you can and here's the thing you're either going repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\n[laughter] you're told me that that's why you're called yeah yeah yeah I mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying ... said I've got ... how do I prepare for it you're saving coverage so\nNow that's our short term long term we got to get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to\nDo with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face and so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be prepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but ah we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards it's time for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi\nTucker how are you [laughter] I'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through a baby step the right now I'm In fact we just paid off our second credit card today though we are done like credit card and moved on if they don't mind\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're working the base that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\nOh no we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can get later\nOn but what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of a ... law and get your input on it\nWe have our ten percent of it but we want to tie without thinking about putting data and giving back to the church and didn't have an extra five percent and kind of giving it to\n'em or their charitable organizations that we believe in that are about it one day or a ... you know when the crisis mission is that we're trying to looking at trying to give what we can to people who need it\nUm but and she's on the other hand want straight ten percent a church and then you are or what we thought what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give it to church and\nWe had a big argument about either yesterday so it was\nI was on you know the the definition of dies the definition of the time was when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus reaffirmed given the New Testament is tent it literally means chant the word means tent\nIt doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twentieth it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to ... they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker a plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you\nI Love ya [noise] and\nUm you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to to gifts and all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is a time\nA love you but the best way to live your life is to to give and all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed within the New Testament is a ties a tenth of your income evangelicals are taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years\nThat that five is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top [noise] before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise]\nSo if you want to biblical answer your wife wins the argument [noise] that's the biblical lots of your wife was argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nGood luck with that rather [laughter]\nOrder to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nBeen listening to for about a year I'm On and off and I'm right now we're in we have about a hundred and five thousand dollars in debt and fifty thousand in cars twenty two thousand and other debt like credit cards and all that\nSo one Osama includes cars\nYes it is because the cars fifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's the ah about eight thousand on line and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income\n[noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty\n... a year where did you use to the old drum yeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why\nNow I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day in real estate ... I've got to choose the house has sold takes listings and expanding clothing by the end of uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand\nBy the end of the year and now what does your why didn't make of the one who makes\nFifty a she made a fifty one thousand\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you use to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that between that long the span 'em and her thing if she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [laughter]\n[noise] okay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for poor and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge what the old marriage vows sad\nAnd so you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape but if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just you can handle that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nWhen we're married and and it's in sickness and health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a princess and be selfish and that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need it my my truck is for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these calls means of course we'll have\nIf I can get what I was asking for what you what it what I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to as\nI'll get a car cash and then she sells her car and then what have at least one car right now [noise]\nMm well I don't know I ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay offs and other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming\nIncome they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYeah and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there ending or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed do stay close\nTo three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today\nI Would show your trial today and I but\nI Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's if your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth about making about a little over a hundred but instead it has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and pay off thirty seven dollars an hour for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car\nBut if you're not wanting to do that as I household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble than\nShe is not willing to\nJoin armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you have a marriage problem\n[noise] okay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit you run around started selling mama's car is not way good way to get mom on board\nHalo so let's try that other approaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income is going to go\nBut if that and then you might be looking at a different career and she's going to be looked at us on our car drew and you get are cheap car to drive you drive a cheap

like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen thousand dollar home\n\n[laughter] [noise] thanks for\nOnly a few five five five Andy and Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped by\nBecause we're in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but thanks for coming by guys are you going to have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go then we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be a the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... own own will be rented or on\nWe currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on at a\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry ... journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a you know\nYou need to get with insurance broker and what kind of our insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I Would be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that\nWho are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the time that they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and show\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property or they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would\nCarry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do with let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords couch you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker\nCan walk you through how to do that and I'm I'm not an expert on camping\nAnd so treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you said you would go to insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that ... ability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs to this much and this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and they cause this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing him on his liability do do hold harmless agreements a carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\n... and\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins okay and um that's\nA liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nYou are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't you know properly and stole the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a hall Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk\nI but I hold harmless is it what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest\nRight it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful [laughter] ...\nTwo page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still wobble\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't have a thanks for the call and use Russia you're joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you're jumping we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll

and I'm a new American I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on our website and find new to the baby step and I know that number one of the thousand dollar\nAmerican the fine my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get back to baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in a stable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you OK but um that's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years and never happened to act we really lucky we've never been laid off you go in and they get sent home pretty quick I mean within a couple\nOf weeks she don't couple of weeks to do something ... going to\nFind something to do when he comes home and they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed paws on one of the makeup of every step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one

had a good night's sleep\nOut of the annuities out of the life insurance and you're right the markets backup\nYet have you hurt your annuities or have you hurt your life insurance now\nAnd we explain all that to you ... come to a greater understanding and appreciation just adds to the leverage that these vehicles can provide so that's something that you really I encourage you to consider it to me it's all about positioning\nAnd\nPart of this means that you have to have the guts the\nThe the the inter intestinal fortitude to go look I Want to address this now is it a popular topic you probably at this point of view I gather the kids around the room you're telling and go play go outside more what Mark's talking about is not for your ears it's PG Thirteen it's like oh my goodness the stuff he is saying is going to happen looked\nA Math Doesn't lie it just doesn't and so this movie if you'd like to see the trailer the two and a half minute trailer to the power of zero\nYou can email me I had a gentleman I emailed it to me [laughter] he emails evacuee goes this is scary stuff you know it's almost so scary people dismiss it they got there's absolutely no way this was going to happen so\nHere's the question what if I'm wrong what is this stuff never happens heavily hurts you by how we position how we re deploy how we put you in in areas where we are protecting what you have amassed what you have created what you have grown the answer is no ... hurts you know\nBut let's say I'm right you will come out on top\nWill have done the very best the most prudent thing you can do at this juncture by position yourself for what I Believe is inevitable this is not politically expedient aren't you just tired I Know I Am and I noticed Asian plays the ads and all\nFor what I Believe is inevitable this is not politically expedient aren't you just tired I Know I Am and I noticed Asian plays the ads and all I'm just tired I'm sick and tired I'll use I'm sick and tired frustrated\nOver all the political ads that are running and the name calling and listen to that and that and this and you know what\nIt's just I'm I'm done with it I mean can we saw\nThose people all of them my opinion they don't really care and this is my opinion mark any can write me hate me hate mail whatever\nThey're in this for them they're in this\nFor them it's not politically expedient for them to say you know what we have to raise taxes you have to cut benefits we have to switch the full retirement age for Social Security nobody wants to say that because then they're not going to get reelected\nBut what I'm saying to you right now is so important that if you don't\nHave this you're not going to put the position to take advantage of when the bad news comes so here's\nA couple of questions I Want to ask you and oh by the way that two and a half minute trailer just email me mark at more F. S.\nDot com market more F. S. dot com emailed me I'll send you the trailer no hooks no catches no obligations just something you need to know in fact at the office we are we we we kind of kid ourselves back and forth we say you know what\nNot only do most people not believe\nThis message most financial advisors don't believe this message\nThey are not talking to their people about what's coming because at the end of the day they're trying to sell you something they're trying to get you one more percentage rate of return than the guy down the street or your funds are currently\nThis message if heated\nYou will look like a superstar within your family with in your\nNeighborhood\nWithin your world there'll be looking at you going well how did you how do you know this was coming well you know I listen to the smart money moves on Saturday and he's talking about this I went and saw the movie the power zero I saw the trailer I've read the book I I I'm now more students now more aware of what's going on in our world and why\nPaul kitchens are not talking about this the presses\nAre rolling the printing presses are printing money at an astronomical rate and as a result we are putting our kids our grandkids in harm's\nWay what's the message is the message is and then we'll talk about these questions here what's ... what's the strategy here's a strategy your weight and you've got your pen pencil and ... taxes are on sale today\nPay the tax get it over with just be done with it\nAnd then put your money in a in an environment where it all grows\nZero tax\nWill mark what if the government changed the laws you know there's always that opportunity yet you're right\nBut\nHistorically what has happened is if you're in certain vehicles where its tax exempt when you go to pull it out they grandfather\nThose policies those plans\nThat are already in place\nDon't let that concern you what should concern you is what this trailer is two and a half minute trailer is saying to you\nDo what the politicians are doing which is sticking their heads in the sand and hoping that it blows by them at least so that they can get reelected what you should be doing is saying what do I need to do today to protect my kids and my grandkids and my family\nGet reelected what you should be doing is saying what do I need to do today to protect my kids and my grandkids and my family what am I doing today to protect them\nThat's what the message is pay the taxes they get it\nOver with taxes are on sale is that debatable will I get and get all these calls with Martin would any taxes are on sale look at look how much I'm paying my taxes\nYeah I get that but if we're if we're spending\nA trillion dollars more than we're taking in every year\nAnd what what hasn't helped is the fact that tax

tricking me is that real really safe is that\nIt's safe\nSo that would be question number to look the bridge is out ahead it is out ahead I'm here warning you right now and then if we were to develop a strategy where you were always safe it's kind of a two part or here would that be good enough\nIf we only stay safe and we never make any money is that really what we know we're gonna help you get position so you can take advantage of what I said a little while ago when the stuff happens\nBecause we will still be here is just a matter of what will the state of the economy will be looking

that it's all about for the most part\nRates of return I don't want to play that game because it is a game don't want to do that won't go there won't do that so give us a call two nine six four four six four to nine six four four six four I have to mention this thing as well\nAnd I think it's important and it it dovetails very much so into what we're talking about when it comes to long term care and I I'm hoping my prayer my uh\nMy hope is that we can get Mr Harley Gordon to come to town he's a uh it probably one of the foremost a elder care attorneys in the country and he's written a book and so I said a little bit ago before the break we're going to talk about his book\nIt's called the convert station called the conversation and this is what are you know trust and said is this the conversation people don't want to have this how how apropos to Harley's book\nAnd the subtitle is helping someone you love plan for an extended care event\nIt's easy for me and I'm I'm not going to do this but it would be easy for me to take out all the statistics that are out there about how many people are going to need long term care how many people every sixty four seconds are diagnosed with Alzheimer's or dementia\nYou know what that does not connect with people we think as agents that it does it it will put people in a position of they start to worry they get anxious this anxiety decree they say wow I Need to pick up the phone I Do you call those guys one person every sixty eight seconds is being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia wanted to ask me\nWell folks that doesn't encourage people to do the planning it just scares them\nIs being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia wanted to ask me\nWell folks that doesn't encourage people to do the planning it just scares them into maybe not doing anything so Harley's book really brings front and center the idea that it's not about now I'm Talking to the guy here\nWomen get this it's us guys we have a hard time with\nA guy guys men gentleman it's not about the risk of you ending up in a facility or having to have care\nThat's not what's at stake here that's not the issue that's not what you're jeopardizing what you are jeopardizing and this is the real message\nIs the consequence of you not having a plan the consequences of what's going to happen to you I'm Sorry to your family your kids your grandkids your spouse should something happen to you this is Carol is\nIn fact if you don't have a plan it is likely that will it will tear your family apart\nIt will tear your family apart\nNot having a plan and not properly funding it can disrupt all efforts to secure a sense of financial viability as you and your family move into the future that's what not having a plan will do\nYou know what we have a deep as a gay guys again women you can don't have listeners but us guys we by nature heavy deep seated aversion to thinking about anything truly awful occurring do you like nobody nobody gets up in the day\nHey what if I get in a car accident today what if I have a stroke whatever Mart nobody likes to think about that stuff\nNor do they like to think what if I have a need for care what if I'm going to have to have somebody paid me feed me clothe me take me to the doctor's appointments\nAnd so as a result because nobody thinks about it the subject is dismissed and that's what ... contention is\nThat being more the case certainly when you're talking about hey you need to own a long term care insurance policy so what Harley's hope when he put together this book was to change your mind by altering how the subject is talked about\nWhat I Hope to do what my goal is when I have this conversation yeah the conversation and nobody wants to have is to say this\nIs that when I'm done I Want you and your mind to say mark Jeff really the conversation the consequences are too severe\nThat I Need to take action I Need to do something because I don't want to put I don't want to have my kids my grandkids my spouse left to deal with this\nSee one way or the other you're going to be kept safe if you have an incident you have an extended care event they are going to find a way to take care of you we know that we're here in America right somebody will rise up something will happen whether you have money you don't have you will be taken care of\nThat's not the problem the problem is what is going to happen\nTo your family it's about your commitment to protect your family regardless of what happens to you the book talks about as he says you're the serious and often irreversible consequences providing care\nCan have on those you invited into your life I think about that\nSo we'll consequences providing care can have on those you invited into your life I think about that the consequences to those you love you said yes to the altar\nYou now have embraced over the years you saw them through elementary school and middle school and high school and college and now they have careers and now are they going to have to put their life on hold see we have that conversation that's a conversation a lot of people don't want to have it hits you square between the eyes just like oh my goodness\nWell Mark I don't think that's ever going to happen well okay let's have a plan so just in case it does happen look you're going to be fine\nBut it's the consequences to those you love and you care about those are going to be the ones that you might be doing irreversible damage to should you not have a plan in place\nThat's what Harley's book is about\nA I Believe it's in reprint right now they're they're printing more and so we're hoping to get some of those as well that may be a give away you you want to call you say mark a when you get a copy of the conversation yes what do I have to deal you have to come in you have to have the conversation with us and then we'll give you the conversation\nBut look if you don't want to have your family put their lives on hold to take care of you then you need to have a plan in place that's our our encouragement to you have a plan in place\nBecause this is what a Harley says and I'll conclude with this he says\nWhat most people don't understand is that extended care is not a series of risks that would happen to them but rather a set of serious if not irreversible consequences that would happen to those that you love\nThis this risk\nVersus consequences that's really at the end of the day what this was about so give us a call two nine six\nFour four six four to nine six four four six four call me on my cell two three five nine for six five two three five nine for six five will you have this conversation with us at more financial we hope that you will\nA couple of months ago I talked about the perfect financial plan\nThe perfect financial plant is that possible we believe that it is in fact society dictates to us that whatever it is that you as an industry put together it needs to be simple it needs to be efficient\nAnd so we're happy to let you know that we have figured that out this\nLack of understanding and knowledge\nAnd that's really been one of my main desires just let's just get the word\nOut

their system down that it's a good thing for them but what do they get on people coming through their country from other Central American countries ... nah I I got to think that there's big money being made here and who knows you know it\nWas so where's the money come from and that comes from these people they don't have any money that's why they say that I mean ...\nYou know it's it's all of

by one of the teenagers in addition most security indicated one of the female teens or seen striking another teen patron\nSecurity as to the police officers issue a trespass warning and bar the teens from coming to the mall and the police did that\nPrior to leaving them all officers got another caller regarding a separate incident\nAt the time the teens who had been barred ... came back they return to the mall one of the male teams was taken into custody without incident as a result the female team that was in the video began cursing attempting to incite other teens to act against the officers\nThey attempted to take her into custody average time she began to fight and resist them due to her stature and aggressive behavior officers took her to ground attempting to get her to

one of those things where I think you know the headlines that oh disease comes I'm asking is now but it's something to be aware of something to think about something in your life as you keep yourself healthy think about your health\nI think about your immune system think about how you need to keep it strong by eating the right things and perhaps supplementing to ah keep that system that is in your body that protects you from getting ill it's weakest in young children and an older people and that's where all of this in this case young children who\nAre three four years old may not have their immune system enhanced\nOr they become targets for this stuff and then you start to think about\nSome of the other things you're talking about a Stephen Hawking is the last half hour some of the great minds that have been able to figure out ways to protect us as human beings from various horrible surges and then you think about disease and and what lives on the planet\nIt back to ... and is there a God he's beings these bacteria these viruses that some people theorize and I think August was one at one time in his career forty years or so ago I remember reading something that he said about humans killing themselves off\nIn the next few centuries and the bacteria and viruses taking over the planet\nThat's what we'll live on the planet for I Can't imagine well yeah I mean look at all of the things that have happened on this planet and the and the billions of years that it's existed what's lived here what's been able to survive here and then when it doesn't survive what comes along next it's really pretty fascinating [laughter]\nAnd you get right down to it but there's a lot of Scrabble ... around including this sort of thing so not to be scared but just keep your eye on it and make sure your immune system and the people in the family and people you love\nMake sure that they have um just the best possible food and the best way of keeping their immune system as strong as possible a simple easy\nAnd pretty awesome when you get right down to it [noise] speaking of awesome today if you're a golfer you'll be celebrating or why they do this in October 'cause golf time is a guess

any undertaking in which you would care to do over you'd like to do it I'd I'd like to do that again right we've all had those experiences\nWe can do that over again David McGuinn\nConfirmed his reputation or back in Nineteen eighty five fellow who was a journalist named John mackintosh interviewed Mr mom again for a column around the sport circuit was the column David confirmed stories about his additional shots that he took when he was playing golf\nWhen you go all the way back to the forties the Gulf association claims the term first achieved widespread use however McGuinn\nIn theory is concerned golf historians gave credit to John buddy Mulligan a locker room attendant at ethics felt country club in New Jersey for the word\nThat's wanting to at my dad's played that club that so fuzzy yeah ethics files a\nTheory number two going back to the Nineteen twenties David Bernard Mulligan a Canadian golfer one time manager of the Waldorf Astoria New York would often ask for a second

about the origin of the ... states that it comes from Thomas ... you know minor Anglo Irish aristocrat and very passionate golfer\nUh people like that are known to cheat I guess [laughter]\nAnyway so if you're a Mulligan person happy Mulligan day you know none\nOf his play golf I think all of this is my father and my dad is super into it as he and my mom is\nInto watching it on TV even though the o lay\nLo and what does she just wanted to take a nap it's a great idea now as regards into it they'll ... I don't get it as a golf channel for God's sakes I imagine they watch the golf channel I guess I I speaking of the channel the golf channel rehab television wise but see last night I'm just trying to think\nWhen it gets worse noting and I are you going to watch you can say you watched it and see I as\nI Know I did not and get back in time I wiped out the FBI I did not watch the Connors how was anybody watches\nDid watch it and you know it's interesting I thought that they did a really good job\nOf dealing with such an awkward thing and there are multiple moments during the episode where the family is grieving the loss of Roseanne and ... they they look like very real tears it it looked like it was a very emotional money was for the cast to shoot\n'em parts of it were still really funny I I for me I I was never a fan of the Roseanne show the first time around I don't know it's funny I never saw drew me neither but I like the few times that I did see the show I always loved encounter John Goodman character and I always like those aren't lean\nAnd and and I always liked the sister Jackie played by Laurie Metcalf and those three are really the stars of the counters and so I think that I'm definitely gonna keep watching I I\n... and it's I think\nPeople still tuned in I think it has a real chance yeah okay I ah the other thing worth production but good yeah I Know I didn't think I'd be saying that but the other thing that's worth noting Nathan ... new show the rookie is still trending on Twitter\n... the last few minutes of that I had forgotten there was on I was watching something else and watched it and it was a there are a lot of well known actors in you'll see a lot of familiar faces from other episodic TV shows yeah a guy who played the FBI Director who got killed in\nUm I'm which are the president's ah ah ah\nSouthern keepers who is it I'm a ... area I he was there and now he's the police sergeant anyway go ahead but it is I\nWell I think about the people on social media apparently loved it and he's in Philly and did a live tweeting along with the episode and so I think that that's been very much hype and I think that that is off to a really good start good um so it it it looks like it's a really fun show the\nThe premise for those of you don't know he's a forty something guy who becomes a rookie on the police force and the getting into his head why does he want to do it and is he a good crop or not\nA lot of familiar people's faces men and women who've been another a cop shows you recognize a lot of them anyway but yeah it's nice

you know like mortgage interest as you write it off there are some things charitable there are some things in the tax code you can just ride off\nAnd there is bad debt that can be written off and perhaps that would have been a way to take care of instead of having people pay for something that really isn't there a right off the debt and that's the way\nYou might have buses or take it off yeah but the problem though is when in order to have a write off you have to have a certain amount of anger on any way I Do a a ... that that wouldn't work for most people who are in this situation\nHigh

interesting items actually hear a protests the Park Service\nHas proposed a raising their um the cost of getting a natural but I thought they cut that earlier this year didn't we have that ... that my memory that the amount of money to pay to go into the ah parks was less than national park service didn't they cut\n'em but now they have new rules for demonstrators I guess in in in\nHow down in front of the White House I think that was our area that yeah that area is controlled by the national Park Service says and I think they want to charge more for permits right\nYeah yeah right right right out there\nOh I ... for an arrow testing though that yea for his visiting there aren't there play out there\nYeah um they propose that does the new rules for demonstrators who gather not only in front of the White House but around other monuments in Washington\nProtesters according to the proposal will repay the agency or for security perimeter processing helping to protect and preserve the cultural and historic integrity of the areas you know is it up in a down to this\nUh I think that there is a lot of damage being done by protesters\nOr who just you know are there to make a lot of noise and uh just wrecked stuff\nThe other thing though there are some good legitimate reasons and good legitimate protests are ... separate them\nIf you're a good legitimate protest group then um you pay them you pay the fee and who determines your very good but generally protest group well I don't think they're just talking about discriminating against any group I think that everything that everyone is going\nTo have yeah ... that's the point everybody ought not to pay because some of these groups are not there to make trouble are just there to tell people what they think they're a lot of people would go there do they want to make trouble\nRight well I think ... is obviously just somehow the park services wants to make more money so [laughter] I think this is probably their best

communities here in Arizona\nHelp determine what some of the biggest stresses for them and then how do stresses impact their health primarily when it comes to obesity so they actually did uh the first part of this study up in Maricopa County in a rural community there\nAh they found some kids who were going to a community center over the summer they were out of school they uh what what those kids and they will go throughout six weeks once a week\nFor an hour they would teach them things like food portion control um they taught them how much sugar is and soda by visualizing it for them and then they give kids the tools to take home and practice\nSo they were measuring their blood pressure or their weight and they measured this weekly and they kind of started noticing that in some kids\nSome of those numbers were going down because they were being more mindful of the way they were treating their bodies\nAre they were also involving parents in this and they also were able to determine that one of the biggest toxic stress is for these kids in that community at least was the fact that they didn't know where their next meal was coming from or um whether or not they just had their last meal and that really impacted\nHow they were eating at home so that was a big thing that they found that they are going to be doing this in Tucson in the next coming weeks are going to be holding some

you'll be\nPeople after all did not change each other and said we merely change ourselves so many couples fight because one partner wants the other partner to be different but again we don't change others we only have the capacity to influence them\nI I Know a lot of member we had the beginning of the school year we started talking about all the teachers who are buying things on their own\nNow there were ... happen right so we're going where's the money going ... that we were putting aside or what is it a hundred and eighty billion dollars that comes from the feds every year and who knows what untold billions are spent by the states and then property taxes\nAnd ... in Massachusetts were building for example a new school in our community school costs Ninety six or Ninety four million or something ridiculous like that\nAnd the the state pays for forty million of it state pays the state doesn't pay we pay taxes to the state and they yanked that money to subsidize with the locals are going to have to pay\nAnd attacks override\nBecause we don't have the facilities within our budget to pay for the new school\nSo what what was what's going on with all this money going to build a nice school got the money to do that we don't have enough money to buy paper books pencils though they don't use books any more they all have tablets assigned to them so that's another\n... eleven member town meeting couple of years ago we approve of eleven hundred dollars a piece for tablets for pretty much everybody in school\nIt's so ... who's using all these tools that are there why do we have such poor results\nIs a socioeconomic thing in this circumstance certain it looks like okay so I asked you ladies to give me your a take on this\n... well your question was why or Asian kids doing better than any other ethnicity I think that's a question for Asian kids and Asian parents did share your secrets I don't know I have no idea what the answer is I I Do a family structure that's debuting ...\nGet out ahead it's a ... yeah yeah ... there's a there's you know there is this different I think survival is a priority in in some ethnicities it you know especially in urban poor urban areas\nAnd um I don't think the divorce rate it and I don't think there's a higher rate of single parents\nIn Asian communities so that could be part of it there's a two parent system there at home um I don't know I think that there are probably a lot of factors and you can't change those factors you know those those are things that you just you\nCan't change but you're right though you have to at least look at the school structure and the education structure and the obviously there are a lot of holes that need to be plugged up\nSo you know you can't if that's if that's if the socioeconomic factor is a huge\nInfluence or on who's doing well well we can't really tackled that but you should absolutely get some answers from a superintendent as to why one school that is what a couple of miles away from the other one why\nIs there about a challenge different yeah yeah yeah I don't know how big your town is ... it's not a city you can't be to have a I mean I Know technically it is a city now I now but I'm not really that seven I'm I'm In New York is not a city at the town is now it's been and the populist the premium\nHas been pretty stable between sixty seven thousand in Seventy four thousand\nFor letting it I can remember oh okay\nTheir premium has been pretty stable between sixty seven thousand in Seventy four thousand for\nLetting it I can remember yeah oh okay yeah so yeah so so to me especially in a town that small there is no excuse why would there be such a huge difference\nNow so anyway it's interesting to see how these uh it's the it's the sort of same old

I'm doing on the job is that one of the problems with the boys are they can't do the job well because they're getting all everywhere to do this and this\nOver I think that people are relying on the police for everything you remember the story of the the little boy in um I Want to say it was outside Chicago he had the lawn mowing business and accidentally moved like swayed onto the neighbor's lawn and yeah they call the cops on and they called the cops on that\nI mean it's just it's the old cat in the tree like it's it's kind of coming it's true now you can people can call the police for everything oh yeah I didn't get my order Starbucks right call the police like it's crazy it's crazy\nIt's it is it's ... there's a there's a dad very serious racial undertones to it that's not that far under the surface and that's the that's really scary to me because I see I see so much racial tension bubbling to the surface and there are you know a lot of\nAlthough a lot of people feel that you know there's there's there are a lot of theories as to why that's happening now um but\nDo you think the best one is\nYou know I've had a very complicated conversations with my friends who are black or\nThat is one is [noise]\nYou know I've had a very kind of candid conversations with my friends who are black or who are Hispanic and you know they definitely feel like since Obama left office that there is a backlash against minorities and um you know and it's a it's a personal thing that\nThat my friends have expressed that they just think that there's there's tension white people are not all white people obviously but there are some white people in this country now who feel\nThat you know that Trump kind of speak their language and that they feel that they've been disenfranchised for eight years they feel like\nBecause we had a black man in the office for eight years that they're somehow white and people were left behind and there's resentment there there's there's so much to it and it's it's scary I mean when I think about it is scary but you know that's I think if you ask different groups of people around the country they probably all have a different answer\nYeah about ... news I guess what it is but it's very perplexing frankly neither person whose name is in the news Natalie Mayflower sours Edwards know who she is\nNatalie one heck of a name may flower sellers\nEdwards senior advisor at the Treasury Department\nLeaking confidential documents about a number of Russian probe targets including Paul Manafort officials that the FBI and the department of justice announced Wednesday they had arrested ms Edwards\nShe faces charges of illegally disclosing suspicious activity uh-huh illegally disclosing suspicious activity\nSo she linked to report is it mostly right Leah reporters editors some real news organization ...\nWell now so here's my question obviously what she did was illegal and she can do you in jail for ten years I think of how is this and I don't know the answer to this this is not like I Am genuinely don't know how is this different from what I'm Chelsea Manning did\nWas did Chelsea Manning go to a different type of prison because she was in the military is that\n... or early became Chelsea Manning yes right she read stuff to Snowden right right right so in this case that ... you know I was in Russia\nAre helping them to hack our um elections and whatever else or you can have a Mac\nAnd then um\nAnd what's her face didn't you get out of jail I don't remember the old ... however many years ... you know yeah so you're that you're including last year this woman go to jail I was like\nTo think she should go to jail I Do think she broke the law you break the break the law you go to jail but I'm just I'm just wondering what is the difference or is there no difference is it the same crime that Chelsea Manning was convicted of that this woman will now be convicted of or is it different because Chelsea Manning was in the military that's where I'm trying to figure out\nGovernment employees got him a secret different same ... sounds like the same kind of thing to me kind of sounds similar yeah\nOr does or doesn't pay what's the what's that expression\nI Wonder like what except on doesn't pay right except that she probably felt like she was doing some sort of ... out and I understand it the right than that um what else do you get from that ten years in the big house\nThe other day over in the room that I was looking at um some of the you'll enjoy this uh some of the sponsors\nThat have been on this program this is the thirtieth anniversary month of the what was the day program has matured into the DJ\nUh some of the sponsors that have been on this program this is the thirtieth anniversary month of the what was the day program has matured into the D.
