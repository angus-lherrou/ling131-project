ago and now the loans are kicking and then if I would've got a hold of your show earlier I Would have been paying 'em off sooner but\nI Will I Am get free or two years ago we had our first child and

return for going into debt fifty grand\n[noise] well I was getting a lot of overtime and the path so it was kind of a lateral move but it was it showed on paper thirty percent increase my base\nIt didn't show on the paper called your check not yet not yet\nWell are you I mean so so far you've got nothing for your fifty grand\nTrue true ... and I've always felt pretty smart with money so I I have a positive net worth right now four hundred thousand between my four oh one big assets and I'm home equity so I'm not I I'm not terrible but I just want to know\nWhat kind of way gas that's do you have that are not home equity or for one\nI have a hundred thousand in vehicle fifth wheel toys like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen thousand dollars\nYeah [laughter] [noise] thanks for\nWas like five five five Andy amateurish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped by\nCars that were in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but things were going by guys are you have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question we do we have\nA question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go then we're going to retire from our jobs in ... in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be a\nThe the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is on your own all and we'll be rented or on we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it at that\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from\nYou for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or which happens to be your non profit and then the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of\nA you know\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that\nWho are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the ... the good so the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do with let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands are land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah keep that separates a infiltrate the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liabilities right with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenet for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords ... you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you'd said you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that writes your policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much and this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and they cause this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the farm plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing him on his liability do do hold harmless agreements a carry any weight in any of this\nUm no I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm the\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um that's\nA liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nYou are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk\nI but I hold harmless is it what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest\nRight it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the hold harmless but I I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and having attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful [laughter]\nThey'll still loose [laughter] so I mean ... they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you and I think\nStill loose so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't have a thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a Christian and I'm a new national holiday that this is something that you've touched on our why\nI'm so I'm new to the baby and I know that number one we have the thousand dollar emergency find my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment where this job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years on or never happened to act we really lucky we've never been laid off you go in and they get sent home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something and he's going to work\nOn something when he comes home if they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed paws on them want to make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as well we all ... and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one didn't as a dental discount program\nAnd um that would be baby step forward and I do that first and a Roth IRA and then I Do it in a ... T S P after that\nIf they're matching I don't think they do but if they're matching you on the ... going to start their with Iraq with a match that'd be the plan\nMichael thank you for serving your country really appreciate it it's good to talk to you Martin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave hey what is that while I was\nA one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just all my rental property to pay off my primary residence or and pay off any other debt also that I have\nOh I'm not sure that that if you got\nThe gift to cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nOkay so your debt free but two cars and the two houses\nRight okay how much do you own your cars I'm fifty thousand on bald each\nOr total on both total okay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty\nOkay you got a lot of car and um so what do you own your primary and what do you owe on the rental\nMy primary to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm and the rental and now my my rental Ohio one fix the un is worth about I Would say or thirty Philip has four fifty but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right [noise]\nSo on you know if we state taking say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nCan say I'm you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go ahead and pay off the rental um my pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know when you start doing what forty fifty grand a year at that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car I'm ordering shoulder rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had a question whether to to do that and and ... most of the party much taller rent on pay off pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind for that but I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college\nI don't know how house by managing cash flow that right okay good no doubt no the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore right now my credit card check that out there and they let me get right by a car\nYou pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that that's the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't sort or ride this out of debt horse it doesn't work can't shorter routed me got to ride him or not and\nSo if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college now say about ... mission where the rentals with cash or go alone out there in the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have to go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah dumped the rental and pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building towards junior college fund and then once you got junior college covered a by just don't want to start in a savings account the junior college junior colleges do within their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then um\nThen once that's done then you just start saving up paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby step share the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the soil that rental I Would I Love rental property but I Love being debt free more\nAnd so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks for the call man we're pretty sure you're joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life in your money it's a free call the phone number is

I'm not exactly sure\nWhat to think that there is not the beneficiary of that ad or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a trial yeah this is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd at ... ... dollars\nWow it should be canceled okay if it's a whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight and yeah and like my dad and I found out the beneficiary and I go I mean he's a great guy I'm not worried about you know that it's\nLike I don't care as a guy doesn't matter if we had a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very unlike the greyhound on you know a wild one\nBut it's strange how long have you been married a long you been\nYeah yeah how long have you been married ... how long you been married five years you know and then five years they've not address this issue that strength just drops I Know it really I mean they should you should\nAddress the issue and they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy on this is a whole lot of policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a port right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo our whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and my dad's\nA I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want to pay that kind of thing you know and then it cuts but you have all\nIt's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nHow are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm a question regarding out part of my retirement savings said comes as a thing called a pinch him from my company [laughter] and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as ... or\n... or ...\n[noise] well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a projected retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total as pets you know and\nAnd my question is whether good at it as a lump sum yes or ... okay yes\nHere's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die or get when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we've got an account for you over here two hundred eighty five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you can take that two hundred Ninety five thousand you could rolling into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal\nRight\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but Mm uh\nIt's still you know if you die then yeah you gotta survivorship on it but when both of you know the same concept ... so the bottom line is it's got a decent\nI Love you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept to block so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low\nRate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you\nDie makes this a bad deal and so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to Iowa race and invest them and good roast our mutual fund so it sounds like your network didn't exist from a million\nA yeah it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well they're total total network to assets house and so forth\nYou know well ... congratulations how old are you I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire one for that but ... before that happened\nA millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents were Ella typically young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nAre shutting patterns or because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nSince I was home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell by twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [laughter] well\nI certainly you got to a live well below your means live they bought a modest lifestyle which ah we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done the stupid things ... I think if you can limit\nThis thing that that should do along the way that's good I like that it\nMay cause McKay every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things but then you can minimize those new things along the way\nIn a way of a modest lifestyle with below you mean I'm no void\nSo do you think you're going to be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nBut he is probably a probably even higher if they if they minimize those stupid yeah maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and it's that simple and the math on that works to your benefit a at a Wal alive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead\nThe question about it a thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute there it's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire [noise]\nOh I Love this millionaire subject is so when\nThe people

and we're going to shut the money in something that's going to generate a low income than have to generate a lot she's only a couple of hundred bucks short a month\n... and above sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month maybe does half that you're still okay so what we're saying is is that you know that there's this houses really poorly managed\n... don't hardly anything [noise]\nYeah it it comes and goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month in ... but the last year I think that any\nKind of women if she's getting seven hundred a month off this house why isn't that covering her three hundred dollar shortfall\nIt was and it was building um her checking account but there's been other factors I wanted to keep it simple they drained her checking account\nOkay I Gotcha yeah than let's cash it out and put it in a good mutual fund or a couple of good mutual funds and let's walk through a child wouldn't do

stepping away from that and I understand you know I'm blessed to be in the situation I Am working with the companies I work with I'm blessed because they don't really they just let me do my thing but I see why people do it especially people that have been burned\nOr just like yeah I'll go do myself or will and I and I talked to a few big YouTube stars and and who are who've turned down one of which\nTurned down a major lucrative deal with Disney because he's he's like a no I don't want to be beholden anybody or make enough money doing this and a Walt Disney would've given him in a much

journey\nThat is the laundry I don't think people realize it's like I I Walk a lot so ah let's just see how many miles I Walk this week just for since I think it started on Monday is when they started doing the uh so far today\nI Am a five o ... o five miles of walking while over ten thousand steps right so for the week\nYou know I'm heading towards ... jeeze\nRight so for the week\nYou know I'm heading towards jeeze about [noise] thirty five miles to probably by the time I get the Sunday service on this end right around thirty five miles\nMaybe a little bit longer they're going to walk eleven hundred miles from where they are now and you've got kids got all kinds of people man you're committed you're absolutely a hundred percent committed committed committed\nIn something like this and this is going to continue the weekend where\nThe bomber will be front and center the rhetoric will be front and center the arguing will be front and center the blame game will be front and center Monday it'll be a little bit more and that's kind of that will be the tail end up putting it to bed and then it'll here's a little things here and there are about it\nBut what will start to happen is come Monday afternoon Tuesday them all week 'til midterms this I Believe will start to become something big and this is very interesting\nI Want you guys to listen to this right 'cause this this right here I find this to be absolutely some of the most racist\nHorrific things according to the left that you will ever here in these three people or leading the charge in this hatred\nIllegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the U.S legally\nI voted on numerous times when I was a senator or to spend money to build a a a barrier to try to prevent on illegal immigrants from coming in we\nSimply cannot allow people support in the United states undetected undocumented unchecked\nThose three people who I Believe I've gone on to do some things in politics or Hillary Clinton she went on to a annoy us and never go away but she was secretary of state and think that was\nA senator as well first lady ah the last gentleman a was a senator at the time when he said that and he went on to do something else I I think he wrote a book but then he was president for eight years so there was that and then the first guy of course is chunky from the rocky movies and he's done several sequels that\nSee how they change your ... see the game I mean that's that that is the game we ... how is the wind blowing quick oh yeah it's going that direction so I Need to be in this direction\nMarriage equality or traditional marriage right now I'm all traditional I could grow in a few years and depending on which way the wind's blowing a I could be on the uh marriage equality it's the game that people play and it's that's how it's being used and it's frustrating\nIt is absolutely frustrating or we need to figure out what we're going to do with this and my frustration comes from the sense that we know what's coming\nAnd this is a small thing the caravan compared to the overall but the optics of it or bank\nAnd as they're coming here what we're going to have is two groups of people Republicans and Democrats who are going to argue it's two people reaching for a glass of milk\nMilk falls over the glass falls to the ground one of them says you did that you need to clean it up the other one says no you did that you need to clean it up and then it\nGoes on and on and on and all the while the glass of milk\nAnd\nMilk itself lays on the floor and it doesn't go anywhere and they argue over it and eventually the people live and\nThe milk itself lays on the floor and it doesn't go anywhere and they argue over it and eventually the people arrive and what has been happening will continue to happen and that is the frustration that so many of us feel out there\nThat is it and the Democrats there they play the game they play the game remember what they said and this is what Tucker Carlson that because\nIf they're talking about of all if you talk about immigration reform in the way that they don't like you get cold certain things\nAn Asian laws that must be ignored disagree with any of that by the way you think nations need borders in orange county nations the cable news genius has to have a message for you shut up\nRacist than just crumbs native is base very very excited every day\nAnd they look at these people as less than human they believe that those folks are are less than humans and they believe that they don't deserve asylum I Believe that you know which is in cages was the net benefit for this country Donald Trump wants you to know that he have the same pay people you have if you have Muslims\nIf you have black people if you have anyone who live south of the Rio Grande\nNow\nBut we heard what the others said right like you know they shouldn't come here and they just can't\nIt's if the game it's it's an absolute game and depending on which way the weather and the wind is blowing it's the way that they're going to go uh I don't have any of these people\nI in fact empathize with these people\nIn many ways I can look at it in and said to myself my God we have people who have been stuck in the mid west in in in in the rust belt for years who can't get off their asses at times to go hey maybe I Need to go somewhere else where there's actual a work and potential and they'll stay there and I and\nI can be honest and say you know I'm not a big fan of maybe you should go somewhere right if it's not working for you there maybe go to another part\nBut they have the right to do that these people don't have a right to come in our country\nSome of these people probably do need asylum I'm not some idiot that they'll take some of these people are some of these people are all just you know some of these people probably\nAre and potential danger because of the corruption because of a lot of stuff that's going on down there the the gang warfare the drugs all that stuff yes all of them\nBut it's a game and nobody is going to do anything about it and come December first ... give or take a few days\nThey will arrive some in Mexico some and Arizona Southern California and then there'll be given their you know court dates and a good majority of them will show up but that won't be for a couple of years because they're so backed up and we'll be talking about the next caravan a month after that\nTwo three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from your twin poll up about monsters monsters UGA yes\nGood monsters not bad monsters and by that I mean now these people we call here are villains Michael Meyers Jason Vorhees people of that nature and I question of the day is\nWho is your favorite Michael Meyers leads the back Jason number is is dead last he's only got nine friday with twenty three percent thirty to a lot of people saying what about Dracula what about Frankenstein who's Frank his name's not his name his name was ... monster but you know they don't really given as your name's Clinton [laughter]\nHorrible name for a monster but whatever will come Clint a you know because you're black or mommy Dracula and Freddie Krueger the reason I think people like Freddie Krueger Dracula is because they talk right\nUh you know because you're black who'd mommy Dracula and Freddie Krueger the reason I think people like Freddie Krueger Dracula is because they\nTalk right they talk and that's\nLike cool like the wolf management right when he became the wolf Mitt in those old movies and Frankenstein just ooh Dracula was like hey check it out like I'm a European like you know dude hanging out in the castle\nAnd I can make chicks fall in love with me was like the you know with my own and then you got Freddie was like always talking smack and so I think they they had the edge in a in a weird way but there's something about Michael Meyers in that mask and just the fact that even if you talk to him\nThere's something about the weirdness of not being able to get through to him", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Tucson",

Andy and Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped\nBy 'cause we're in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but things were going by guys are you have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go then we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be a uh the the operations\nOf the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... own all and we'll be rented or on we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on at a\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and then the nonprofit you would sit down and talk\nAbout what kind of a you know\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I Would be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that\nWho are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the turn of the good show the the nonprofit or you either one and show\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property or they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance\nOn the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an ... interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do with let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a infiltrate the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liabilities right with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenet for instance in a house you can get confidence insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords ... you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but interest\nAnd walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you said you would go to insurance broker and they shot five different companies that right airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that ... ability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash wrote what happened in the same kind of thing here they\nWould find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs so much in this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it caused this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\nBecause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements a carry any weight in any of this\nUm no I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm the\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nYou you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a hall Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk\nI but I hold harmless is that what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest\nRight it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean ... they may not lose as easily but\nDie you're not ... they're not liable they're still wobble [laughter]\nThey'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't have a thanks for the call euthanasia you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your

what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a Christian and I'm a new national I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on our why\nI'm so I'm new to the baby fat and I know that number one fan the thousand dollar emergency find my question is do you ever think gas saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering am how do you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years I enter never happened to act we really lucky we've never been laid off you go in and they get home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something ... going to work\nOn something when he comes home if he did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed paws all want to make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners checkout one dental dot com it's not\nAnd I do that first and a Roth IRA and then I Do it in a ... T S P after that\nIf they're matching I don't think they do but if they're matching on the ... going to start there with her off with a match that'd be the plan\nMichael thank you for serving your country buddy we appreciate is going to talk to you Martin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave hey what is that while I was\nA one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just all my rental property to pay off my primary rap for them or in path any other dead also that I have\nA much other data got\nJust two cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the life that would say three or four months\nOkay so you're dead free but two cars and the two houses right okay how much do you own your cars I'm fifty thousand on bald each\nTotal on both total okay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty\nOkay you gotta lotta car and um so what do you own your primary and what are you oh on the rental\nMy primary goal to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm\nAnd the rental and now my my rental Ohio one fix the end is worth about I Would say or thirty a fellow at work they be but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right [noise]\nSo on you know if we state taken say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars\nAnd so on you know if we state taking say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go ahead and pay off the rental um my pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know when you start doing what forty fifty grand a year at that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car um Oregon shoulder rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had a question whether to to do that and and pay off more to pretty much tell the rent on pay off pretty much all my that yeah the ... but I also have in mind that for that like I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in three years she's going to go to college\nI don't have a house payment you can catch while they're right okay\nYou know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit card check that out there next time you get hit by a car\nYou pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that that's the planet you can to get on track yeah you can't sort or ride this out a dead horse it doesn't work you can't shorter routed me got to ride him or not\nAnd so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college and I would say about ... some other rentals with cash or go along out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have to go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah dumped the rental on pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you've got junior college covered um by just don't want to just do it in a savings account the should junior college junior soldiers still within their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then um\nThen once that's done then you just start saving up paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby steps here are the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the soil that rental I Would I Love rental property but I Love being there for a more\nAnd so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks for the call man we're pretty sure you're joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life and your money it's a free called the phone number is triple

show right now on what oh for a long chain you\nTo Dave Ramsey show\nJoanna is with us in Los Angeles are Joanne welcome to show how come I don't\nThink that taking my call Cher what's up [noise] um\nSo we're currently on maybe one on and we've been on a plan for a month and I'm David ... to ... we're in the process of getting a life insurance um evidence to last a\nMap and a summer that his dad took out if they had a full term policy on him when he was younger and he wants to eventually take that over and make those\nPayments um I don't know what that is um but we have four kids I'm not exactly sure what the best thing to do it if I'm not the beneficiary combat it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a trial yeah good\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's close to half a million dollars\nWow it should be canceled okay\nBecause her whole life insurance policy ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight and yeah and like my main cooker it and I found out the beneficiary and I don't I mean he's a great guy so I'm not worried about you know that it's\nOn my own director guy doesn't matter at a good guy the ... it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family\nParents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very ... and like going on you know wild blind\nBut it's strange yeah how long have you been married for a long you been married five years you know and then five years they've not address this issue that strength the strength you know it really I mean they should you should address the issue and\nThey should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy on there's a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term\nTo create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money so our whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars a whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you've got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and my dad's a I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now\nI Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want anything to pay something that you know and then it cuts but you have like I said\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nYeah I have a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings comes as a thing called a pension from my company [laughter] and that overall is about eight percent of my total as sad or\n... or ...\nWell it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a projected retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total have had you know and\nAnd my question is whether the cat has a lump sum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you'd die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die okay when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefit the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred eighty five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you get that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\n[laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred\nWell that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I did [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but Mm uh\nIt's still love you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you down the same concept to block so the bottom line is it's got a decent\nBut low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you\nDie makes this a bad deal and so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Bijan lumps arms enroll them die of race and invest them and good roast mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nUh yeah it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well they're total total network to assets house and so forth\nYou know Well Don ... congratulations how old are ya I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire one for that but before that happened\nA millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents type relatively young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nAre sightings patterns or because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nSince I was home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell by twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [laughter]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means live they bought a modest lifestyle which ah we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done the stupid things I think if you can limit\nStupid thing to do along the way that's good I like that it\nMay cause because every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things begin you can minimize those new things along the way\nIn a way of a modest lifestyle live below you mean I'm no void\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if he's listening to me right now\nBut he is probably a probably even higher if they if they minimize those stupid yeah\nMaybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and it's that simple and the math on that works to your benefit a at a wall of live if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor sure you come out three hundred grand ahead [noise]\nAlive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand I had a\nQuestion about it a thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute there it's always good for people here how to be a real

help\n[noise] okay [noise] so I didn't follow your plan for like a couple of months now I had the emergency finally that I'm working on baby step too good on that night and I had made progress not a ton of ... it's on ...\nOn my issue is idea of a chronic illness and I still work full time and I am not letting it take all my life is good and my question is is how do I I check 'em\nFor my deductible ... recently I recently switched off clan Samantha both started again and\nAlso the chronic illness you're going to hit the duck double every year\nRight um it's\n... the guy that thing on the go it it it's not they don't see it and it's not life threatening are you going to do it while every year\nYeah okay so now I don't know so they look at what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that is that it's an air tanker commissioned the Packers are unsure of where it comes time okay so if there was a ... year but I Do is I'm sure because it's relatively new guy that I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced God help you that you have with this the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing it what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in his budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand or the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a\nYou know a\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands ongoing frantic medical and just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every\n'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally like penny

June was my first day in real estate ... I've got\nTo choose a house is sold six listings and expanding clothing bought into uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that's six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand\nBy the end of the year and that was what does your why didn't make of them want to\nFind makes it the uh she made a fifty one dollars that\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you used to make\nYes okay good good news right\nGuess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first started out I'm only selling to houses that between that long span 'em and her thing is she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's\nSo that's between that long span 'em and everything is she wants to keep her car because she thinks she's making money to pay her car [noise]\nOkay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates you get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for poor\nAnd sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows said\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just give them hell that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nOne were married and and it's in sickness and health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish and that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need my my truck is for sale already have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these closing the courts will have\nIf I Can't get what I was asking for what you what it what I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good uh what is called the ... and that's what I was trying to tell her to is I'll get a car cash and then she felt her car and then we have at least one car right now [noise]\nMm well I don't know I don't ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay off in other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got piled up the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYeah and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are ending or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed all they\nKnow which is two and three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's

with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's your room mates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but uh but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of debt making about a little over a hundred but instead has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car\nBut if you're not willing to do that as I household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble

husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we purchased our life insurance and we got part permanent impart term\nAnd of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nOn the insurance about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and could we immediately wanted to get rid of the term or sorry the permanent and just have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about whole law permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you do is it still bad\nShall we still didn't get the terms\nI don't know he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey\n[laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clear on the lesson you heard me\nYeah when you never tell you under any circumstances to huge life insurance and investment vehicle one hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhy would so you knew or knew financial advisor that's what I Would show you you don't have a presidential advisor you have a life insurance salesman okay the shelling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do is switch to four hundred thousand just of term H. and then the money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which I'll do a lot um and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed with mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class was uh yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he just language tells me one of those things are you this guy's a lawyer or he's are ignorant\nBut he's a family friend who's in the um actually one of our friends just apparently gave them our number because they use and for it as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which it is I mean I I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life told someone to buy life insurance doesn't investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight in the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy was until we were eighty with hand\n[laughter]\nWhy don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys over charge you for everything you sold you know guard and you're probably going to just cancel and everything with him so this guy really needs a good firing\nOkay that sounds like well Oregon I Do I'm In the end of this week\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about you\nIn the end of it right All right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um the people who sell\nInvestment based or\nWhole life or permanent life or portfolio or universal or anything where there's an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me\nAnd so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return\nRegardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been on a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value permanent portfolio universal\nIndexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is alive owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever now I did get\nA horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than Fifteen to twenty two year term\nHi anything other than\nFifteen to twenty year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you\nThe best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal\nWhether it's your car insurance your homeowner's insurance\nLong term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind letter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on our own any of it that show that while this always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that\nYet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance out by the way a broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the help they usually a north local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your corner homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state formation foreign nationwide in Asia\nOr Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide in and out but um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nIs one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for their new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this when was the last time you checked on your financial plant\nWhen the world's falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on them home with a mortgage\n\nSo we just we quit

your host thank you for joining U.S Open phones AAA eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five to two size\nBrian is starting this hour off from Indianapolis, Indiana Hey Ryan welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThey they think take my call sure what's that I I have a stepdaughter she's ten years old and the fifth grade she does okay in school but she struggled with focus and attention but surely where she really I guess you got a ... year olds are really good with people\nDon't want to start a business or were the other great selling a channel that she may but I also want to do it for\nYour your phone is breaking up can you speak directly into it you're cutting in and out can you hear me better now yeah sure\nOkay so my ten year old she prayed\nI don't know I got ... we heard we heard I got up to that point I started breaking up though I wouldn't Asian ... she's making can that she's making chaotic exactly okay\nI Want a percentage of the truck she goes to show your thoughts are charity fell by quite shy you at the ... for profit company or ... headed up the regular L L\nNone of the above\nOh shut up as a sole proprietorship here over complicating a candle business with a ten year old\nOkay just showed up as a sole proprietorship you're probably not even gonna make any money you make a little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you want to fund a Roth IRA re for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business to the point is not the business the point is what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work\nThey're learning interface with customers and how to treat people or they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... that these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand the accurate or if she make some money that's just a bonus right\nBut what ... what are you what you've identified as you've identified the way this kid is wired and a lot of us that are entrepreneurial or a a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you'll pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know sense\nThey're getting ready to have a kid go off to college is shopping\nAnd understand\nFor college costs because it is one of the most bizarre things to learn the\nThe distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive schools I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of color just the same cost it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and colleges across America we're now in forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stop of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come a long shot in the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the rams the organization\nWe'll pay for that high school to have foundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've had about four million students go through it one of the coolest things has happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it and paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby\nThat's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good\nNow Tyler Moore is with me on the line and tile is from the University of Wyoming he's the associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle White uh go man thank you for doing that is\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here and the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition at any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the difference are like so like you were cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct\nWow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this\nI immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I meant we'll get him to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world need more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that\nCan be anyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that in her spare we're talking about a curiosity independence of boldness\nAt pursuit that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and books for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right vessel decorate\nYour football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as good I play on words but you you guys got the you got to the table first where this way to go man I Love\nIt it's a great motto and it goes it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have as a coming on\nThis and you gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is it going to have as of coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are a state that is very practical were state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the rains the education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're you know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nI'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nBecause sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line I've talked to a lot of ... around the country a mile and chancellor in ... Tennessee and it's a constant thing\nThe ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition of doctor are renting institution\nWe are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south we can be a solution that\nProvide students and incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping a student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nThem in so many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over a twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself cowboys\nNow that's a good size school that's not too big and small that's a that's a that's just right those are ... deal to us right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and\nWe appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nAnd I love it I Love the motto and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but a bottom line is lesser mascot and so\nNow it's ah that's very cool stuff I Love it and want a neat thing that the College of the University of the

I never thought that Lolita should be set free love leaders the orca captured almost fifty years ago and ... channel do back then we called them killer whales that's just one of the reasons I'm Glad she's had a home at Miami seek worry him for the last half century\nI did my first story on Lolita twenty five years ago even traveled to Florida to see her in person\nAnd she seemed relatively happy at least as much as you can tell by watching an animal answer ... is a conceit of human beings\nThe fight over her captivity has been going on that long but a lot of folks failed to recognize she served a purpose like I said we used to call them killer whales and back then the public didn't have the positive view or cause that we do today Lolita helped popularize her own species and fueled the demands to protect them\nTurner loose today and she's likely to end up dead in the ocean just like Kay go the killer whale debt\nSo large large and show them how wonderful line taking the AIDS Tucson news and talk [laughter]\nLars Larson show when\nAmerica is in a strange place these days we saw the circus like confirmation hearing of judge Brett Kavanaugh this scandalous charge against him and Democrats who demanded an FBI investigation predictably even after the president agreed to such an investigation and the independence sex crimes investigator brought in to do the questioning says that Christine forge testimony\nWouldn't even support criminal charges of of salt now enter to chime in America were crazy allegations can be made against men and women\nThat doesn't even matter if they're going to be proved the person who was named as politically and professionally dead\nAnd it's a modern scarlet letter that apparently only applies to conservatives think of all the Democrats mayors and governors and members of Congress to been reliably accused of terrible things but God help you if you're conservative snack those double for supporters of America's Choice for greatness Donald J

the lucky machine so\nWho knows maybe the winning mega millions ticket will be sold right here in New York City so do you have a lottery fever that is a very good question because it's now over a billion dollars cash values about five hundred and sixty five me in dollars you're probably gonna walk with about\nThree eighty to four hundred million depending on what state you went in and whether or not they take taxes some states are tax it it's in say now I I Love you guys you love me we have this this thing going on right well we're we we talk we debate we have a good time\nOr listen to this 'cause this advice for winters I think you need advice for winners because\nSomebody potentially this weekend and potentially to people this week you know several people as we can are going to want it to his money\nWe're also getting some very important tips for these potential new millionaires Ryan and Mary ... an twenty twelve they won two hundred two million dollars and when it comes to spending they say winners should pace themselves\nIt's great to have a second home but then great to have car in a boat and things like that but there are a lot of other costs that come with that property taxes insurance and gas money that goes along with that purchase good advice there\nWhen combined more than one point three billion dollars are up for grabs right now so good luck to oh\nYeah huge money this weekend so here's the thing and this is what I don't think people realize\nPeople win the lottery writes somebody wins five million dollars after everything they walk with two and a half million or whatever it is they end up walking with the cash value in ... and everything so they take the money and then I go out and they spend right and what they don't realize for a lot of times people that when these have never had money\nThey've never made six figures let alone getting this massive when will they get the money and\nThey don't know how to replicate the money meaning they don't get the money to work for them and they go out and they spend it and then they can't replenish it so you've got to realize if you laugh you know twelve thousand square foot home you got to heat that you got a cool that you've got to pay for the property tax you buy a hundred thousand dollar car it's not a thirty nine dollar\nYou know oil change right\nYou buy a two hundred thousand dollars a million dollar car it costs money at the ... it's like thirty thousand dollars is the oil change or something ridiculous like that these are the insanity things that go into the so when you have to think about how much\nDo you want to just go hey look this is that we're going to take X amount of dollars you know a million dollars to a million dollars were this'll be are fun money are play money will get the gadgets we're going to get the rest of we're going to invest new smart things with a lot of people don't do that and they don't know how to replicate it and winds up happening is they give a bunch of it away they overspend and they look back and they're like wow\nWe're screwed and we don't know how to replicate this three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you

potential of what may come from this separation sending army all of those kinds of things and what does Mexico going to do\nIt's being stopped as of this moment by Mexico so we appreciate very much what Mexico so but as of this moment to see what's happening is I think so\nYeah they're they're trying but I don't know how much that's really going to happen that's been in the end it always feels like they're going to stop but they're going to stop it but you know Mexico's been complicit in allowing people to come here and uh\nYeah and it always feels like they're going to stop it they're going to stop it but you know Mexico's been complicit in allowing people to come here and\nUh some of that out of spite some of that out\nOf a you know look you can go\nYou can either go there you can go back from when she came those those are your choices right here and as we know with Trump eighties about enough is enough\nA percentage I think fairly big percentage of those people\nAre criminals and they want to come into our country and they're criminals and it's not happening on my watch that going to have\nYeah and I would say I like is it a huge you know\nThere are some people that come here that are bad we can all admit that is a is a large percentage no I Do not believe so I'm going to go out on a limb and say that's a negative ghost writer I don't think it is I think it's a lot now\nInside of the mass of people that are that are coming here or there are people that are bad\nProbably right with any large group\nThere are going to be some people you go you're going round up you know a thousand or two thousand people doesn't matter where you are what part of the world there's a good chance within that group there are some people that are probably not good people if you have a random group of people to the tune of two for three by whatever it is\nHow many of them probably small but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't stop everybody I mean at some point\nIn time we have to make a stand when it comes to immigration don't I mean how do we owe that aid to to to the American citizens to the people who've come here and done it right to the taxpayers\nOf this country\nTo our constitution to the rule of law do not only that we must solve something I think we absolutely do\nWe are deeply aware or that the the way that Mexico will handle this way you will handle this is your sovereign decision or Mexico will make its decision if leaders and its people will decide the best way to achieve what I Believe our our shared objective\nYeah\nAnd as far pale right there because they're all trying to figure out what to do in one of the big things that is potential ... and and this is the thing right here\nOne of the big things is sending the military we've seen in\nThe fight them sending it were militarized seeing and you know the border and we're doing all these kinds of things will what have you done Republicans what have you done Democrats to solve\nAny of this nothing you play a game you ignore you kicked\nThe can down the road you use it when it benefits you politically and the rest of the time you just ignore it from comes along for better or worse he says I'm going to take this is the mantle I'm taking up when it comes to certain situations\nBut border the wall symbolic that's the way I feel it is but the reality is is for a lot of people they want something done there's a bigger question here and if you don't want that wall\nDidn't fix the immigration issue if not given as damn wall\nAs you know I'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border if this is a [noise]\nAnd it's a night I have a feeling and this is just me I have a feeling that tonight when he's speaking here in Mesa that he is\nTonight when he's speaking here in Mesa that he is going to\nSay he's going to send the military but he can make some sort of an announcement that he is going to to send the military down there to stop and to turn people back I have a feeling that's what he's going to do 'cause he's\nWhen he comes to these things this is one of those things people like do you think's going to say anything crazy is that well first of all Trump is he is a person that is\nHe feeds off whatever they give him the energy tonight will be huge crowds already lining up to see him or massive it's incredible to see what's going on\nHe's going to feed off that and if they're feeling and he's feeling it yeah I think I think the reality is he he's definitely thinking about it he wants to put in it he I think sometimes other countries don't take him seriously until they taken serious because they've paid a price for it\nWe got to figure it out and Mexico was the one right now that\nIs either going to put a stop to it or I think that they're going to look if there's if those people are allowed to come through there is going to be some issues not only with the new trade agreement but also with the fact that you're going to be sending people\nLike the military to the border we have many challenges but his way of just proven with our trade agreement we can with mutual respect for the sovereignty and rights of each of our two nations tackle these problems and I'm confident that we will resolve them together\nConfident\nShall see we shall see this as Mexico's foreign minister minister uh Lewis a v the gallery\nSomething that we agree fully with the government of President Trump and secretary from there and then moved to serve the cause the root causes of the Central American migration particularly to create a development opportunities\nYeah yeah that's a centrally what it is\nThey're so corrupt and there's such a mess and while we well I have every right to blame the Republicans and Democrats for the failure to fix immigration here when it comes to the continual immigration\nYou have to look at those nations and say you guys have failed your people tremendously you're continuing to failure people and they're coming here and that is not good for us and that sure in the hell not good for you because you're corrupt sellouts\nWho were incompetent that's it and that's why you're countries are held ...\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and Joe is your Twitter you can tweet us thinking about this for one second right\nJust for a second just for one second I think about this where you live is so bad it's so corrupt that you are willing on foot\nTo cross hundreds potentially thousand plus miles of dangerous terrain fighting the elements fighting drug traffickers\nAnd murderers\nBad coyote days human traffickers think about that what's that say about your country\nExactly three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and Joe is your Twitter speaking of countries we have the best country in the world very case closed and historic boom boom boom we don't always agree and their organizations out there that that that you know what they they've got some benefits maybe you kind of like but the reality is the way that they go about doing things\nWe don't always agree and their organizations out there that that that you know what they they've got some benefits maybe you kind of like but the reality is that the way that they go about doing things especially in the political level you just don't jive with then there's a company like a Mac right a Mac is amazing they're incredible\nThey're not like the big behemoth AARP out there who helped with the uh for double CARE Act who wants a you know this\nWhole like health run health care system run by the government didn't want any of that they don't want Social Security ... immigration reform like that they want to leave things the way it is they are not jibe with the way that you believe that's where a Mac the association for mature American citizens come and they\nAre amazing listen not only do they do that politically and they help you they advocate on your half\nA what they also do is they have benefits member benefits there are so numerous\nForty percent off movie tickets at the forty percent off or amusement parks or retail restaurant hotel discounts travel discounts you name it they have it and here's what they're doing for my listeners how about this a membership for one year free doesn't cost you a penny than what your credit card all they want you to

[noise] [noise] [noise]\nIs on the line in Denver Hi Caitlin how are you [noise]\nBut we're not having a hard time finding that in my lab played in the industry as it usually you have to hire so how can we get is hoping I can branch I mean the only way that we can actively fight reliable and get people to be a part of the law candidates that\n\nYou don't know any painters that are good and reliable people well we did a health care um that are good I mean people\nAt a party there hasn't been reliable\nYou don't know any painters that are good and reliable people\nWell we do have that and if they have their own ... well\nMhm so the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own businesses\n[noise] ... yeah okay\nWe're we're trying like me but um that I have black and I know these were financially and so I don't know where to look in order to get\nWell most of the time they would rely people run around with good reliable people yeah\nAnd most of the time do fishes run around with due to ... so usually when I'm looking for good reliable people I look around other good reliable people now I could be that you look in some of the other trades and you know one electrician that's a good person or Trump carpenter that's a good person and you start asking them who did they know that's a great\nPainter that you could bring on to the job\nA part of the problem they got as you're in a very very hot construction market in Denver and so everybody's got work even do fishes\n\nAnd your has your husband's got my working hand on maintenance so that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage or when you've got a construction boom always in the city and that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know an example in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology\nSomeone that is a great Rubio unreal developer as an example there's a shortage of technology and Web developer is out there right now in most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub\nBut um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we'd go on like you've done websites you've gone on Craig's list but we get in technology groups and associations and but mainly\nGreat developers no other great developers bright painters now where the great painters or somebody is not a developer but has other influence in and other knowledge of the tech industry does a great person will no somebody's developer and send them our way\nAnd of course you're going to pay them\nAnd um pay them well\nI'm a ... paying ... doesn't make them anything except the well paid ... so you you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of excellent people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people ah sixty four percent of people that joined our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here\nThat was a thoroughbred wanted new in thoroughbred that wouldn't want them to work here in another area now we have the advantage of being a little bit larger and having a vast array of jobs not just a single job available but but how that's how I've always done it I've I've found thoroughbreds Roma thoroughbreds and donkeys run with donkeys\nAnd so you know you just got to find out find your thoroughbreds and and people on in the community\nThe steak dinner in it for you guys send you a good guy you send him a steak dinner you send him much sooner ... him and his wife through scripts or something because it's worth it\nTo get somebody in there and you know being being good that way and I'll tell you I'm going to send you a copy of a book that is one of my favorite hiring books that have written the last two years and it's from a friend pat Lynch you only it's called the ideal team player and the ideal team player is three things hungry\nHumble and smart hungry humble and smart\nAnd that's what you're looking for in any position in any organization in every trade and every organization has some people to qualify other high quality people every single one\nAnd if you can put them together in a trade that by and large is not that kind of people than you really a brand differentiated yourself from the other people in your marketplace so hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we will send that to you\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five\nOr ... is with us in Wilmington, Delaware Hi Lucia how are you\nHi there thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm new at center and I ... and they have to put my question actually about the four oh one K. profit sharing with my former employer I Lived it over like you suggest into a rut roll ever IRA\nAnd then I got a statement in the mail yesterday basically there was a other section where the fees or over three thousand dollars and by further looking into it they're called fortune for future face\nI'm In there for eight different finds I'm kind of confused of every three thousand dollars of my money\nHow much money was in there it wasn't that much actually with only around Eighteen thousand dollars\nI don't I'm not aware of a mutual fund that has a forfeiture fee\nThan looking at um it's a ... with eight different names and then it says forfeiture is and then it has a bunch of negative and it adds up to almost thirty one hundred dollars\nThat sucks yeah so I thought especially when it was only you know a small four one K. to begin with\nYeah really um did you roll it was a smart Mr pro\nI rolled it over and so ... previously on another irate I had already opened so you don't have an advisor I don't okay um\nI Am sorry I Do not know the answer to your question I've never run into that ... the only thing I can guess is is that you bought a ... that your company your former company the mutual funds are high the mutual funds or some gun\nThat have got some kind of gotcha and they're obviously but I don't know what they are go ahead and get in touch with one of the more of us are pros and your area and just see if they will answer that question for you okay maybe they can tell you exactly what happened at least you'll have the mystery solved since Dave Ramsey too stupid to answer that question because I just don't know the answer\nThe I just don't ... I'm Sorry I Wish I did write Joel is with us in a Decatur, Alabama Hi Rachel how are you\nI'm great how are you for taking my call\nSure what's up [noise] so my\nEmployer is going through open enrollment or our health insurance benefit and I'm kind of on the bed and I'm hoping that maybe you could kind of helped me job\nUm they've introduced a new high deductible a program with an H essay which they will be contributing to and I'm trying to decide that I keep my traditional the the a plan or should I jump on board with this high deductible plans\nOn how much is the premium on the ...\nThe premium all the eighty to ... pay period they calculate to about Twenty one hundred a year and what about the other one the other one will be around\nFour hundred and Twenty one hundred show Thirteen hundred dollar spread and cry and how much does the doctor will only at\nOkay they won the ... it'll be four hundred per individual or the ... and for the high deductible Thirteen fifty per individual that there is a twenty seven hundred or the family\nYou know and how how uh how old are your kids [noise] and my kids are pending Thirteen are there any uh ongoing illnesses partial by prime [noise] I was offered a young lawyer to duck double [laughter]\nHow often do well I'll say like why am I right now we just hit that adopt a ball and one of our family members emerging that hit ... years as I said\nOkay so here's the thing you just compare your Thirteen hundred savings versus the extra extra risk you're taking were fairly healthy we don't usually run through the ... so the hot adoptable lower premium makes a lot of sense for us and that's how you look at it [noise]\n\n\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family\nHas debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial\nNeeds that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace those stay at home parent\nWow yeah my hero yeah how do you do that or do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you got to start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um and small steps add up to a giant stuff at the end you know\nAnd I I Would add to that or the giving and the ... um well it's really court I mean where when we started I\nUsed to routinely saying click while we're driving in church like boys what we're given what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that then I'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality anymore wearing taking away it's we've learned how to Liz\nHave joy within our means and once you hit that point it's um\nIt just makes the road a lot easier to drive\nYou know so you have a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar mortgage approximately when you started this and um it didn't seem real that would ever get paid off somewhere along the line you looked up and said\nAh this is going to work and they started like you were writing downhill wants to the climbing up he'll you know what I'm Talking to the point do you remember where that was in the mortgage balances like when you got it down to fifty or you got down to a hundred or when was that you went at gun we're really doing this\nBut I think it was last year I I went back to work for one year and\nAll of my income went towards the mortgage because it was about fifty fifty thousand laps and we just just piled on every month it was like you just kept counting down month by month we're going to make it and it was it was off\nIt but you wouldn't have even going back to work if you didn't already have those numbers calculated knew it was just for a year now if I can do this for a year were done by some in for a year\nYeah and you can embrace a year of pain so by then you knew it was really going to happen it was real it was before that that you believe that yeah I I mean we were under water on her mortgage for about three four years that anything for\nMe it was like when we uh oh it as much as what the equity was um then it's like started feeling you know we couldn't breathe and and\nNow at least we can sell it and get out of around right on okay\nAlright and good very good this is good

them Hey David how you doing taking my\n... ... you could uh settle the debate for my wife and I thought a loophole or\nFuture um we have about Seventy five thousand dollar the debt collectors we um we own our home outright uh we have a vehicle that is in case than at Seventy five thousand probably make a decent money and we have an Iran\nThat had about two hundred and ... and it sort of equipment on one what's decent money\nOr she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo that the question that I that I have a good faith that we have is um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was not an inheritance in here and she had to take a certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for the inheritance money I'm is who you\nTake one lump sum\nPay off all of our debt and then to repay ourselves back off of that to an IRA I'm so that we don't have to worry about including sleep paying the uh interest game if you will her a worry about that is that she um you know she is going to be coming that aren't good for that for our retirement\nUm my report could at is is she already I'm thirty eight we still have a good amount of time to be putting into our\nUm different calming count so I guess my my question is should we go ahead and take the distribution help all of our debt that we're no longer paying the um you know the interest rate or should we go ahead it pay that debt down as we are\nAre they will be there for in the winter you and a half years well\nWe've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way to wealth what is the shortest distance to wealth\nAnd I'm In the process what in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what gives gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and it's not just one sided it's not all investing in mind that it's not all that in mind that it's not anything it's just a process of financial planning process\nThat process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years and many many people have become millionaires and multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using that process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process and if your is it so that the way I Would answer the question obviously me being me is I'm going to tell you use that process and that won't answer your question what to do with the money\nBut um but you've got a first aside do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process was called the baby steps and what it's based on is a couple of things number one year most powerful wealth building tool\nIs your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk\nNot only increases the peace and the quality of the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically freeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks and uh and the second part of the things driving the process is is the personal finance is eighty\nMake money with instead of giving it to banks and uh and the second part of the things are driving the process is is the personal finance is eighty percent behavior it's only twenty percent have knowledge the stuff we're talking about snow really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is so having said that we say baby step one save a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that too is to be dead free everything but your house you've not done that\nThree is to have an emergency fond of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then force you don't have that for start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is in your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about who fiber so in our savings account\nIf the inheritance was not on the table what we would teach you to do that down to twenty four through the uh or take twenty four of the twenty five and throw it to that and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five thousand dollars in debt with a two hundred thousand dollar household income it was ... or ...\nOr a couple of months ago and I'm a went on a on a knife in your life wait a minute or no on him right probably the majority of\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know twenty five dollars and that\n... ... ... you know\nYou guys make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do it the right way so it's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this inheritance immediately to become debt free so that you take all those payments that you don't have any more and you use those to build wealth with you have a paid for home\nCorrect we we heard it when it\nOkay All right and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite a hunger go somewhere north of ... Seventy five\nHundred and Seventy five thousand dollars correct\nOkay and why she taking distribution says they'll just taking it\nUm ... we want her financial grant or told her that she had to get a good uh this debate to I'm a cover her at a over the fear that hit hard over at the most part because the way the quick money out of town\nYeah it's a bunch of crap um the uh\nOkay because anytime you start making your decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invested\n... what would I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and I'm getting a different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all the debt\nAnd I would invest the rest of it\nOr in something that I can see control and know what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something like that I honestly don't think that's what you all are going to do\nBut that's what I Would do um because I think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen there's a lot of opinions flying around here\nAnd you guys have got to get inside this and to as a couple of decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do instead of them telling you what to do and it's a different different situation so I think she inherited the financial advisor\nTo I don't think you picked him and um and that's really a bad medicine as well Ninety percent of the time are you guys need to pick them or you need to re pick him and hiring again and this time he worked for you but I think he's still works for grandpa even ... dead\nThey need to pick them or you need to re pick him and hiring again and this time he worked for you but I think he's still works for grandpa even though rebels dead and that's the way their stuff works usually bad bad medicine Travis what I Would do just catch the whole thing out pay off all my debts and invest the money\nWas watch less that's what I Would do and that would take your wonderful two hundred thousand or income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now\nHold on I'll send you guys are a couple a\nCopy of the book the total money make over at a walk you through not only what to do but why do it and then you can decide intentionally whether you're going to use our system or someone else's doesn't matter to me [noise] Oscar's whether it's in Chicago hey Oscar welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThey have a Republican to stick to today with my car certainly how coming home my question is quite a a begin to 'em or listen to you on value to open on broadcast and I'm just randomly doing everything that\nWe do we get older but I Know I have a partnership\nUniversity ... because you don't like to I can do in order but I'm just a ... point through my doing everything you're saying about doubling so the question today is\nCut off all my credit card um I can say that I called the credit card company to actually\nMove those count totally out of my main that we just all I Want to remove become patient abusing if you've got a right way\nOr absolutely absolutely and to be close the account completely not just cut them up and that'll keep them from reporting activity on your credit bureau report and it'll keep someone from accidentally fraudulently use using them or are you\nFrom using them down I definitely would close the accounts as soon as I cut up the cards\nNo doubt about it and talk to you Oscar monitor heavy as a new listener hold on I'll send you a copy of the book the total money make over and that'll get you started and give you the\nThe framework from all these

from Laurie in Iowa I was interested in opening a five twenty nine plan for my daughter she has autism so I may open an ... account instead would depending on the severity of or autism\nMy biggest concern is that I don't know what happens is the money to five twenty nine plan if she doesn't go to college can you tell me what happens to money not used for education\nOr it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed and ... it'll be taxed and heavily penalize\nSo um you know the five\nNine is not a good plan a for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education is going to be and on where you get a special needs situation like this\nI'll bet you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education is going to be and on and we've got a special needs situation like this I Would use the ... um and or\nI Would just use mutual fund just bored and mutual fund\nAnd let it grow and then you can just take care of the child with that money you're just you're marking it for them for their future or they may do a trade school they may do uh uh they may be able to do a full for your academic run 'em\nThey may do a lot of things I don't know how the severity of this I don't know exactly what you're facing but you simply going to save money it's that simple invest money in your name and you're controlling it and then you can decide to help your child however you want to the only advantage of the table or the five twenty on it's just the tax advantage\nStill just an investment in a good mutual fund\nLike Washington says at our as it grows is going to be taxed\nThat's the only thing so it's a it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education\nBut again where you've got a special needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular count saving it in a mutual fund if you want to use the ... that's fine that's what it's designed for you all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it where I can get my hands on it and I'm I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push of our twenty nine just those two things uh ... in a traditional such a situation\nIt teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all and the other thing is it allows that money to grow tax free and so it's a ... that's a wonderful benefits but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child you know\nIt just in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do um so we're letting it grow but in this situation I I'm not the tax benefit is not worth the\nPension you in the corner and actually hitting you harder later I'm making you wish you'd just pay the taxes\nAnd and that's the way to work out open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five ... on Twitter David I'm thinking about studying abroad next summer but the cost is at least five thousand dollars I really don't want to go into that\nUm but I'll be out of college soon and this was a once in a lifetime opportunity what should I Do\nIs that there is a hundred percent chance of Dave Ramsey is never going to tell you to borrow money\nFairly predictable I'm Thirty years\nI've been doing this almost under twenty seven years I've been here and there I've never told people more money\n... if you want to go study Rob I suggest you get your motive job five thousand dollars to do just work your little tail off\nAnd then go and enjoy your study abroad experience and pay cash for it and that way and we'll follow your home\nThere was a point um be amazed what you can do if you really really want to

life like retirement and I'm Wondering I'm would be a good idea on how to invest that extra money I have to put my house in Middle East now you know that's a\nGood good question how old are you a fifty four fifty for you're single\nOkay and how many years do you think before you buy a house [noise] um I'm thinking at least sixteen\nOkay All right go well as long as you've got more than five years I Would use a simple gross stock mutual fund or a series of them\nFor something like that I probably would your shoes and that's in the index fund because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I've started to a group of ... five hundred fund an index fund and use that to grow for the next five ten years or so and do you buy a house\nAs long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nIn that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar things\nI don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and I 'cause I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick question uh so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a a nurse and that that is I'm Wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nI'm so my question is if they work for me to go to school now I'm thirty two years old my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now after a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand\nA year and um so if I go to school it's going to cost me ... years of not working\nOn that tuition of around Ninety thousand dollars mhm uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful uh together would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm\nSo uh but it's a what do you make a year now uh right now around Seventy thousand\nOkay so you're saying this is going to cost you a three hundred grand three years of ... three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than on the out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school um but I don't think I can catch anything right now because I I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nA or putting and Lisa putting a down payment for a house next year before I started school so\nThat then you need to wait until you can pay for school or whatever but you never in Thirty years of doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school\nOkay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter of when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with not agreeing\nYeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow it um I can see it pretty easily ... how long does it take to go through the glass again or go to guy ... it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nOr thirty grand a year yeah and and she makes what\nShe makes a hundred and fifty thousand you\nCan't cash flow thirty granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA love note when I'm not in coal\nNo if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and ... thirty thousand a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I I'm Sorry fifty thousand it's it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year I thought you said it was Ninety thousand [noise] ah sorry I got that wrong it's it's the sixty thousand a year\nSeems high yeah it it it is a it it is an expensive program yeah go to a less expensive program so that but cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it\nFigure out a way to pay for it if I usually go you don't actually have it all starts stacked up ahead of time but you've got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student loans whether they finish or not\nAnd then you've got what's known as a freaking mess

hundred and Seventy nine\nBillion dollars that's a hundred and Thirteen billion dollars more than in the prior year but the Treasury Department here in emphasizing that Seventy billion dollars less than four cats in the mid session review so they're saying that it's less than we thought earlier this year\nOkay oh so it's a less that's good news right it's\nLess but it's the spending and that's the thing that's a big thing it's the spending side of things we can\nThat's good news right\nIt's less but it's the spending and that's the thing that's a big thing it's the spending side of things we continue to go hey let's buy this will put it on credit cards with a high interest rates and we'll just keep doing that and then it doesn't matter\nBecause we'll pay it off later we'll pay it off later what we don't have that much to spend its okay we'll finance it\nFor the government three point three trillion dollars outlay four point one trillion dollars and when you spend more than any taken so that's where you get the deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars for twenty eight\nYeah that is not good and and again the lip service sounds wonderful\nTo ask you about the

that\nWhat the Ponzi scheme is a giant Ponzi scheme with no laws and it needs to be\nSorted out and I don't know what that is I don't know if we look at people in their thirties and say look this is what we're going to do\nI've always been open to privatizing some of doing some of the we've gotta figure some stuff out and the way they were doing things is to try to grow this things to make its

up with some stuff\nOr having a cabinet meeting a little while and we're going to ask every secretary to cut five percent for next year\nYeah cut five percent who's up for that I'm raising my hand\nThat's a very very important request that are making everybody sitting around this table tremendous amounts of money that is something that we can do and I I Believe we can actually do it's usually\nI think we could do but just because we can do it doesn't mean we will\nSo he's out there telling all of his people that I look here's the deal and this is the way I Would like it is a
