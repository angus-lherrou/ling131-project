like Democrats always do which is what they live for\nThey didn't stop and say wait a minute are all three of these guys Jewish\nBecause if all three of these numbers these are the top three Democrats money people by the way which is why he named them\nAnd he said and it didn't stop to say I am I going to be called an anti Semite because all three of these guys are Jewish so then you could stop and you could check it\nAnd your father George Soros is Jewish\nAnd helping out is just a little bit when he was a child and Michael Bloomberg the billionaire thirty five billion dollars or say he's he's

impeachment\nAnd the father is Jewish\nAnd I was ... hedge fund managers are good when they're left is right [noise] right and then that critics\nSuch as the Anti Defamation league have been some of the blame on President Trump and his allies for encouraging dangerous behavior and their political rhetoric\nThat's they're encouraging dangerous behavior or by the way the Anti Defamation league was taken over by an Obama administration official who is a political apparatus check\nAnd he's not a legitimate a DL later he is a Democrat Party operative\nPeriod full stop so when the news media go to the aid the L. A. formally respected organization now just another adjunct of the Democratic party they know that they're getting their statement from an Obama administration official\nAnd I've got more Obama administration official this morning too but first let's go to sick highland been over here this is a Sigmund Harlem and I believe that's his name as friends go on sick is a sick high within four short\nHearsay type is for the left and he's got for jobs they pay millions of dollars on Showtime and NBC and he's a smearing snarling mal content is malevolent or his ... his ... am words he was on the television this morning and he was talking about the president of the United states\nAnd and they love there are still hung up on this the president says I'm a nationalist and then he explained what he means by national I Want our economy I Want our trade deals I Want our military I Want America to be first which is what the president of France the prime minister of France would say or anyplace else\nBut they said oh yeah a Hitler called himself a nationalist\nHitler called himself a socialist too but that doesn't seem to rub off on Bernie Sanders or on Alexandria Ocasio Cortez who didn't grow up in the Bronx but grew up in Westchester County and as lied about everything and she's as dumb as a stump she's almost as dumb as Mika Brzezinski but not quite\nSee Harlem and this morning summing up his view of the president of the United states\nThe president of the race in these other to demagogue he how that they can do that is after the ... national a taker and all the stuff we said\nYeah he obviously condones anti Semitism any soaks up nationalist hatred and what is a nationalist hatred\nAnd what that is the right people from other countries I guess is that what it is that I'm I'm not entirely sure I'm sick high women he's ah he's on the team he's one of the boys they are the problem of course is it's not them they're not hate filled they're not angry there\nNot sowing the seeds of discontent and on MSNBC demo team named James Hodgkinson did not go to a baseball field to mowed down the Republican Congress said none of that was inspired by them\nOr or the Southern Poverty Law Center it's always the other guy it's the other ... the other crap you remember that uh this is is it's it's Trump and Fox News they're at war with Fox News because they don't see him from the party sheet music\nOut what happened that Fox News without the Fox news on top of the Republican Party what happened to it is they were both corrupt bankrupt his two sons that were hollowed out and waiting to be taken over by Donald Trump they'd been taken\nThe Republican Party what happened to it is they were both corrupt banker of institutions that hollowed out and waiting to be taken over by Donald Trump they've now been taken over by Donald Trump I Know of course much worse much uglier place and they were five\nYears ago ten years ago ... years ago they were in pretty ugly places back then for throwing much we're place now I don't I don't\nKnow why anybody would show up at a baseball field and start shooting Republican if you're an MSNBC fan I don't know why the hostility see the geo pay the Republicans were a corrupt and bankrupt institution before Trump came along but then he took the Republicans the entirety of the Republican sixty some odd million people\nTo a very dark and scary place and and then there's the Obama and the other the dehumanizing again I'm pretty much shocked\nThat some leftist doesn't literally shoot at President Trump\nEvery day of the week the way these people spread hatred and I got I don't know how many Republican members of Congress have to be shot may political assassination attempt all this stuff but white partners yet as treated us nothing and honestly the news media is passive approach to all of the violence that we've written witnessed over the last two to three years\nHas fueled it and they're turning a blind eye to the white powder to James Hodgkinson to MSNBC Israel to Rachel Maddow Israel\nTo the political violence violence of antifa ... to the political violence against the police which has inspired by the Democrat Party\nThe news and Brock Obama specifically the news media turns a blind eye to all of that they tamped that down for the Democrats none of that becomes a part of the public a discussion and only violence that is perceived to be coming from conservatives is is focused on\nA embellished by the news media and so on\nSaying Harlem and the dehumanization program\n... not even a question of whether it's presidential behavior not not only human behavior in these circumstances any effect that it has on his followers on his ... his base is of course [noise]\nAnd dangerous [noise] of course\nThat's right the demo to cause the followers in the Denver teams are the real problem and the big problem of course across America is a right wing terrorism\nNot a ... he used to be a a and they love this white nationalist thing this is something that I've latched onto like a pit bull and they're not letting go\nAnd they've got a job because of the sickness brought in by people from the caravan\nNo dog whistle here uh when Donald trial these are these are ... or a fog corn he's blaring it out [noise] he he wants the white nationalist to know that he's on their side\nHe's like a New York business billionaire white nationalist from queens white nationalist they they Jean Davis up out of whole cloth and they pedal it every day\nAnd then they invited this miscreants on by the name of ... Miller who looks like a vampire like a transgender vampire actually and ah he's a strange kind of creepy little man that you wouldn't leave alone with the kids\nFor a minute he's of course an Obama administration official who was there a propagandist\nAt Loretta Lynch is State Department when all of the corruption was going on of spying on their political enemies and all this stuff\nSo that's why NBC pays this person Matt Miller again a Democrat Party apparatus chicken they bring 'em out and they treat him like he's an objective arbiter decided was a former government official they don't ... mentioned that he's a Democrat Party\nSpokesman in ... they they say is like a Justice Department official for really for who like a career person\nThat party spokesman in ... they they say is like a Justice Department official for really for who like our career person no he's a political rancor and the guy is unbelievable but he put his finger on the problem in America\nIt's clear now there is a serious for right wing domestic terrorism problem in this country\nShould I start playing the audio again Shai by the end chief of audio do we have the police being shot audio in Texas in Baton Rouge\nOr do we have the funerals from New York then we have James Hodgkinson shooting up the ... the problem is well there there was the completely benign non lethal the so called bombs are which are a perfect parallel for the white envelopes\nAnd uh and they don't see it that way 'cause they're not aware of of these things they have new timers Matt Miller he's a Democrat\nPet something the Justice Department and the department of homeland security have to address up but there is a problem for for them they can address it when the president United States the head of the federal government is a cheap propagandist for these right wing movements\nI didn't give you a lot of time so to speak\nThe carrot and yeah I mean I'm an immigrant okay make twenty six years ago a good bet it did all the health checks and all that sort of stuff I mean just as the other stuff is based on logic most most a lot of countries that have a fairly equal society\nIt is everybody gets better it is now the buttons\nYeah well that's you know you're a reasonable person were living an unreasonable times on where you have a lot of unreasonable actors in the conversation in and out of the media in and out of politics and I'm a I'm very concerned about the vulture culture that we are becoming an\nWhat an awful country we're becoming these days\nThe levels lock your money make over ... money manager life on what ...

how are you\nI'm doing well do you think of it taking my call sure man what's up in your world\nWell uh my wife and I really sat down and realize that we're on a bad road for future and decided to really take control of our finance that life and [noise]\nJust calling to see things get would light from you we recently found some stuff on line and had a friend who just that we watch some of your guys videos and ... on line there from there and so you know you step into right now we are currently saving for baby steps one\nAnd we have a total bit her loan and consumer credit card debt of Seventeen thousand nine hundred dollars [noise] uh my question is I'm including in that Seventeen I went ahead and rolled in our\nSecond mortgage that we purchased on the home we just moved into in that total two thousand one hundred and thirty five dollars go\nIn my mind um from what I've learned in South not working that's on calling it was should a role in that second mortgage the reason why I think that is because that's been lower um our bills once I pay that off\nTo your your second mortgage it'll two thousand dollars\nA year or so my wife and I just recently got into her second how\nYou know a guy so crude ones they'd be able to two thousand dollar second mortgage yes it's part of your debt snowball and baby step to\nOkay good I was just curious I wasn't sure if that would be the best way to continue to attack is to have your sailing through for a week or two daughters\nYeah if it's if it's under half your annual income on a second mortgage we always suggest you put it in your debt snowball and a man that's an unbelievably small ones so thank you congratulations well done and I mean just knock it out and I'm I'm Glad you're attacking this it's going to work for you\nDebbie is with us in Anchorage, Alaska Hi Debbie welcome to the ...\nUm I had a question about whether it would be wise and maybe that's got to get back to refinance our house to pay a credit card\nOffer in twenty four hours with no commission and no closing costs with no repairs Gert now do you buy all types of real estate yes Joe you name it\nWe buy wild card that's amazing you are going to have them in offering twenty four hours or you can list their property if they need top dollar right yes Joe that is correct ... that is the best of both worlds spell it or listed I Love it yes Joe we also worked with buyers to find them the perfect place but\nDon't wait because interest rates are going up ... my real estate man into Sunday you Joe I appreciate that although I Love your show\n... called courage digital realty executives buy two oh nine five four fifty eight hundred again by two oh nine five four fifty eight hundred for all your real estate needs\n... your mid term election destinations they should be one of the wind cake you th music on the news and talk\n\n\nI\nPhones a AAA eight to five five two to five books is with us from Pensacola, Florida Hi Brooke welcome to the ... high Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nMuch for taking my call uh my wife and I were moving out to a ... station out there or we have a a courthouse here in Pensacola and um I Know you normally not to buy a house if you're in the military um but uh [noise] make good money last two times I've done it\nBefore they pulled out of three fifty\nOkay and uh you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nWell not unless I catch up on retirement investments should ah you know at two twenty five ... and now I can afford something up there with how much do you have in on retirement is that all you've got a two point five K. non retirement down by about a half million dollar house then yes or what's\nYour household income or about one eighty [noise] okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell\nSo you get stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible\nAppreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing and you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um\nI'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes\nOr I wouldn't either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and on retirement um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable\nIn order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash\nOr non retirement cash and money from this other home\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred and when you sell it you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not any more expensive markets for you to move to in the military than San Diego\nThat's about the ... I mean Hawaii Hawaii maybe okay by a there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper in the San Diego I think we all agree to that so if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing and buy a less expensive home maybe a larger home but less expensive home the next by in the next station does that make sense yes or the\nIt's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non retirement cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something\nIn the for hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash\nIn non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing from a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is is not for that long\nYou're not going to be there ten years\nAnd if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years uh but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of ...\nOr that that makes us going to change during that ten years\nUh but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up\nUh I I own my own business and I'm a try to figure out how not to be a crime and under orange is the one I'm ... years old but ... retirement should I go or oh\nOkay well you need to start or retirement and I guess I\nDo you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of debt and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you are more money freed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put five Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nA band around a lot I average probably right about a thousand only [noise] okay\nSo somewhere around fifty grand a year okay the affair and out are you a thirty four and okay good do you have any debt no effect good for you or you're single okay okay does your wife work outside the home yeah you're a nurse what does she make\nA right about that and get all kinds of All right so you got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no data\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has a thorough three or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office you would put some money there especially if there's a match\nAnd then you both need to do a Roth IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just 'cause you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else said do you do it because you understand it and you don't buy something you don't understand when it comes to investing\nThat I recommend good growth stocks mutual funds for your long term investing in your ... in your Roth

that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money and our first a student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurting but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you move closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year last year the incomes doubled down right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct them and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right there so you really have been doing this ... okay and then the last year or kicked down about the time you saw the light at the end the Donald income comes up ... yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this for your cars six and a half\nAnd a good um I think for me the hardest part was\nI'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see the hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper for you to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and\nUm so I think when we paid off our first student loan um that was just such a victory feeling for us um so it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kinda flow out wherever to really nail down a budget and in the envelope system and that was hard for me to the\nYou know I think for me it's just the the sacrifice um you know the world we live and just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying the nice things and I'm just constantly you know talking ourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nIt's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can live like no one else and I really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know do by what we wanted but\nI'm to be here now to be able to talk to you and all these people and just say that we did it it's just an amazing feeling so\nNear free you know those are the ... last three hundred pounds [laughter] it really does because he has a lot of that yeah it's pretty incredible ... well I Know it was a long time and a lot of sacrifice was worth it Yes sir yes that was back into no no\nNo no we've never had credit cards we want to cash flow I'm we're on babysat for well at the beginning steps to babysit for but we're wanting to save up to cash flow for a minivan\nLiver not say that but during the ...\nChanges you're going through his good good for you guys like well congratulations to you have more church leaders are more detractors as you went along um\nHad a lot of cheerleaders yeah we were um really supported by our family and our friends especially once we started getting the ball rolling and paying off dead it was kind of just people were in disbelief that we were able to pay off so much and um\nAnd at the same time he went to the big things for us with our journey was um being smart with our money especially all the extra income that was coming in and things like that but we also wanted to still I'm available lord in use our money for him and so\nI'm a lot of you know for the first few years a lot of our money was going out not towards that end we felt okay with that and so that's just part of our journey for people to not be afraid to still be generous while you're on baby step to even if it's a huge lump sum because the lord bless us in so many ways when we um\nI mean we've kept both of our cars my cars like eleven years old and we don't want another car payment we're at the point to where we literally it was we were out\nAnd I mean we've had both of our cars my cars like eleven years old and we don't want another car payment\nWe're at the point to where we literally it was we were outgrowing our car like with the car seat he couldn't even put a seat back all the way\nLike sitting out but we're we're getting a very high and that so probably write stories my parents they blasted us and gave us they're paid off as TV oh wow yeah so um you know that's just one of the main you know blessings that and um you know where it's given\nThat given to you they give it the grandkids [laughter]\nYeah yeah it's\nJust been incredible

that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay All right so let's let's kind of had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other are probably some books some stuff too but we're pretty close there so twenty thousand dollars a year as what you need to earn\nIt there and minimum wage doesn't do that unless they're sounds like you need a new job [noise]\nAnd I have an opportunity to start a whole family family name brand clothing at me now I don't have the money to put up right now\nNo they don't need to get into that you have a job you need a job you need to so you can make more you can make 'em Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and managing you can make\nGood money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour or ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs or other stuff so I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage\nAnd by the way you make enough to work your way\nUm you are going to be working all the time though and if you but if you can get a situation like that the semis self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever\nUm and you\nUh\nYou can control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to struggle\nBecause you're going to work and study and got a clash and that's all you're going to do what you can make it if you do that\nThe other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there\nParticularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you okay kind of an indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\nAnd I married a hospital that actually planning on working at an ... they will forget all life can't lend it out like that in fact body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans because I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the math were you in are doing here\nSo I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you couldn't control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old that sounds to me like you're a rock star thank you and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHot [laughter]\nThink you don't mind working and and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars in student loan debt you don't need to it\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable and your tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career\nIn terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nI'm mean nursing is just there's always a shortage\nSo you're going to do very very well but I Would go talk to that go talk to that hospital administrator at the local hospital just set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place there's a kind of you can do that\nAnd uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator\nWho by the way needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nAre very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people on your side helping you accomplish this um\nThis task that's in front of you but you're on your way\nYou know get get some people on your side helping\nYou accomplish this um this task that's in front of you but you're on your way you're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to you call me back if you need help as you're fighting through this Greg is with us in Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\nDave thank you for taking my call how are you today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I just have a question for you I'm On a way out our I've talked to oil and get your opinion on a couple of things here um my wife and I don't have any at all with the exception all of our house\nUm we do at least our cars and um [noise] we do that um I have a customer and that and a good client of mine that I reciprocate or the money that they spend with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation um ... chair\nThe main question that I have is we have um\n[noise] some investments 'em over a hundred thousand dollars with\n'em too off IRAs and some mutual funds and that type of thing ah she has four one K. I have a four one K. actually has a pension I'm as well and right now we are paying above and beyond our mortgage um bought our house by about\nTen to twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified compared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once you're dead free except the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and you're dead free except your emergency fund then I Will put the everything above that towards the house till the house voted off\nSo take your income sounds point one five make sure the total of all the Roth IRA version four one\nK. contribution you're doing is history that I'm not ready to them that much greater than that back some of the contributions down a little bit and throw the balance of our service not up to that as you get it up to that because we're the balance of the house and I'm Lynn we suggest you're listening to all forms\nResident gum aggressive growth and international\n\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back\nYeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them will pay cash for 'cause my incomes going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm a I'm not gonna camp anymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you're you know you got past that stage now your back\nIs that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by things open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Claire how are you\nA good Dave how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you so we can all your data sets for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on I had on retirement but we are behind on college savings for two kids show how old are your kids you\nAre they are twelve and ten\nOkay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement\nI'm a little over a million over your head\nCongratulations ... billionaires so what's your household income\nDefinitely feel that way but yeah we\nAre I mean when you have one without million dollars you're millionaire yeah okay yeah you're you're right [laughter] [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income a little over two hundred okay so why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get plenty of money for college when you've got to you\nA little over two hundred\nOkay so why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get have plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWell we're paying for private school right now as well what are you paying for brown to how much cash how much ... than a year per kid or total total okay you make two fifty when looking at you like it you don't have like two hundred I mean one eighty okay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's ... ... that cash flow can be turned towards cash flow in college too if they choose a college that's a reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point I yes nine so\nI I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement\nYou don't need it you're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to set aside\nAnd put Fifteen Percent ahead side so we're talking about thirty thousand under such fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say some college you say ten\nGrand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until they go to school don't have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine get or the one that's more of us are pros and they'll help you do that ... day Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area\nThe people we recommend them sit down when you help people that five twenty nine together and pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you are not working our plan at this stage\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby step seven to increase retirement beyond Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty ground\nSo that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nAnd instead of having an actual game plan we lay out and go this is important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this\nAnd that's ten grand a year per kid for college to kids that's plenty granted if that's what I mean you've got is where you are so good questions thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Donald's on Twitter at Dave Ramsey\nAt Dave Ramsey I guess what you're

right here in Tucson Jared is the director of resolutions wealth solutions for women here at retirement evolution\nAnd she's also the Medicare and the health insurance specialist care and it's great to be here with you today\nWhat's been on the minds of the retirees this past week have retirement evolution\nWell Lou Ann ... definitely open enrollment season or Medicare that as heads and I'm getting lots and lots of phone calls an appointment about changes in Medicare just in our market so some people may be losing their plan\nAnd they've got to pick a new plan some people are seeing rate increases in their plan\nEvery that he has wondering what's gonna happen with the part B premium\nFor two thousand Nineteen and of course lots of questions about\nWondering what's gonna happen with the part B premium for two thousand Nineteen and of course lots of questions about how are my drugs going to be covered starting in January so we're really working closely with folks to make sure that they are going to be set for two thousand Nineteen\nKaren are there are lots of changes with the drug part of the insurance\nThere really are there are changes every year so I think people don't always understand that the drug plans can change so the way your plan may have coverage or medications last year may not be the fame moving forward and we always want to make sure we avoid any nasty\nSurprises moving in to the new year because this is the one time of year that you can make those changes to your plan\nRight okay good to know so Karen is the person to get a hold of their retirement evolution is I'm going to just give me your phone number out right now in case somebody does have questions Karen they can call you at five to zero three nine nine sixty three forty one\nAgain you can call care and you could ask her questions about Medicare and you can go and visit with her view like that any type of health insurance five to zero three nine nine six three for one they were going to be talking about what if\nWe live and tell one hundred years old and this was such a top I Am now so many people are living that long now isn't it amazing it's amazing in fact recently and Italian woman her name was Emma ma Renault died peacefully in a rocking chair at age one hundred and Seventeen\nShe was not sick she just passed away peacefully and not only listen to this was she the world's oldest person that em I was the last person to have been born in the Eighteen hundreds of crazy I think that's something that you wouldn't\n... and the changes that she has seen in her life [laughter] I mean she's basically seen to industrial revolution right to really have it\nYeah so that's what we're going to talk about today we're going to be talking about whether or not\nYou are prepared to live that long are you prepared to become a centenarian that somebody who turns one hundred years old\nSo care and you're going to help us by showing us ways we can prepare financially today for this possibility is it difficult Karen to encourage people that they need to prepare for something that's us far office may be living in ... well it can\nDefinitely be a challenging conversation because in the past we really looked at planning for retirement for about\nTwenty to Thirty years at the outside and and now we're looking at planning into a hundred or beyond so I certainly let people know that the odds of you living to be a hundred or increasing and you're going to face all kinds of risks\nOver the course of the lifetime you've got the risk of losing a home dying prematurely being disabled and unable to work being in a fender bender in your car the list goes on and on as far as risks that were exposed to but for people headed towards retirement or if they're already there living a long life sounds like a reward\nBut it also presents a genuine risk we in the financial business called longevity risk\nSo it's a really good idea for people to make sure that they protect themselves\nFrom the other risks that I mentioned right your car insurance you have homeowner's insurance those kinds of things but in retirement it's also a good idea for people to protect themselves from this longevity risk this chance that she'll run out of money if you live a long life\nSo we're really talking about here is building your\nOwn longevity insurance or your own longevity strategy because the fact of the matter is people are living longer\nAnd that means they may need to have more ...\nStrategy because the fact of the matter is people are living longer and that means they may need to have more money to fund that longer retirement when the last several decades\nMedicare and what's your sense of how well people are prepared for that possibility because it seems like for a lot of people the longevity risk is not going to be at the top of their concerns about retirement\nYou know you're absolutely right longevity risk out living your money basically is always top of mind for me I saw a study recently where only ten percent of the pre retirees age fifty plus who were surveyed said they are financially prepared for retirement last Thirty years\nMichael today it's to help change that and the minds of our listeners\nBut among the pre retirees that I talk to you every day I sensed they do think about their longevity and what it means for them financially if they live a really long time and if they're not\nI Would think knowing that number the size of the asset base that you need to carry your retirement it would mean projecting retirement expenses right\nAbsolutely you definitely need a realistic list of retirement expenses many of your day to day expenses could decline could even disappear\nOnce you retire so for example if you're no longer commuting to work every day your auto expenses may go down depending on where you live maybe you don't even need a car so those are things to think about if your house is paid off by the time you retire\nMaybe you don't have a monthly mortgage payment to worry about\nBut if we look at the other side\nOf that ledger and we calculate what you have what your network says that means adding up all the stuff\nA retirement account like an IRA four one K. your Ross an investment portfolio your stocks bonds if you have any of those that are individually held\nYour home or their real estate holdings argue a surge donor and a vacation home you and your siblings went in on those kinds of things do you own a business do you have insurance contracts and any other assets\nThat you may own some people we see may have specialized collections maybe guns or cars or Navajos blankets or something those all fall into the asset category\nAnd then we want to compare one side of the ladder\nTo the other the assets you have or you project to have a retirement versus the expenses you expect to have to go from there you can really figure out a strategy for continuing to build that asset pace and for how to ... spend down those assets sustainably overtime\nSo no doubt given all the factors that come into play in these calculations from inflation to the assumption is you have to make about investment growth rate since we're really makes sense to work with somebody who can coaches for somebody who can be your quarterback somebody who is a financial professional\nSo of course in our office we really believe that creating and then and the many and regularly revisiting a strategy for protecting your retirement nest egg presents a unique set of challenges and I think these are challenges that you don't necessarily want to put in the hands of just anyone\nAnd today Karen is offering you a chance to call in set up an appointment go in and visit with them at retirement evolution is this is a complementary customized map that you'll get for your retirement here's the number to call five to zero three nine nine\nSix three for one again there is no obligation and they're going to look at the big picture like we've been saying they'll talk to you about your needs your retirement your desires your dreams\nAnd based on that conversation they're going to provide you with a meaningful asset position as a map and if you want greater level of certainty about your income and your financial well being than don't pass\nThis offer up have you've saved about two

...\nAgain in January I Am on hold for Medicare seasoned\nBoss Sam okay because you're very busy so let me just guide you to their website for everything Rhett Evo dot com R. E. T. E. V. O. dot com\nToday we're talking about what if we live until we're one hundred okay we're talking about financial considerations for those people living to be one hundred carrying if you have clients who do crunched the numbers and it appears that they're going to come up short on assets to last them through a long retirement what would be their options\nWell I think it's kind of funny looming on because you just invite our listeners to call in if they've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement uh-huh and some people may be thinking what are you crazy you just told me I Need a million plus ... right so again I Want to go through we talked about what all of those assets may be\nSo if it looks like you're going to come up short or if you're worried about coming up short there are some obvious steps you can take one of them is to start saving more right now so if you're not in retirement yet\nStart saving more contribute as much as you can afford and as much as the law allows to your retirement plans whether it's a four O. one K. or an IRA\nOr a ... or whatever that vehicle may be that you have the ability to contribute to and also take advantage of any matching retirement plan contributions or stock purchase programs from an employer folks that's free money take the free money right\nWhite and if you're over fifty also try to take advantage of these catch up provisions that the government has provided for us with your retirement accounts and the federal government allows people who are\nOver age fifty to make a larger tax deferred retirement plan contributions to kind of make up a little bit of that ground than maybe you didn't do when you were younger\nNow eventually once retirement hits I've learned from you that it becomes a matter of converting assets and didn't come right\nIt does and you need to do this at a rate that really provide you with enough income to cover your expenses an fund the lifestyle you want to live but you have to be careful that that we really doesn't deplete your asset based so much that you run out of money prematurely you need to take stock of your retirement income sources establish how\nMuch money you'll have coming in from where\nWhen and second in command so that may be things like Social Security your retirement account maybe it pension\nYour investments needy income from a job we have lots of retirees who go on to reinvent themselves them retirement and go work in their passion versus they're kind of day to day drudgery they felt like they may have been doing maybe you've got rental properties maybe you have a new at ease\nYou want to figure out the rate at which you can sustainably\nSpend down your assets so that they last as long as you can eat\nAt the end of the day everybody needs a retirement income strategy a written planned right\nYou'd do it really is important and not only do you need a written plan done so that you have an idea of what's happening\nToday based on things but it needs to be revisited in the future because no matter how long you expect to live you need some type of blueprint for how you're going to spend on those assets\nGive you a game plan for having that monthly income that you need every month and given some of these complexities developing a retirement income strategy\nIsn't necessarily a do it yourself undertaking so even if you're pretty savvy about investing and finances developing an overall strategy really understanding where that red lines falls and your retirement plan where you actually going to run out of money\nThis is one of those things you may be better off developing in conjunction with a financial professional somebody who can be your ...\nGoing to run out of money this is one of those things you may be better off developing in conjunction with a financial professional somebody who can be your coach through that process\nSo whether retirement is already upon you know whether it's just close at hand maybe even a distant reality my contemporaries are certainly starting to look at retirement now that the goal for everybody really is the same you want to keep as much money as you can in your own pocket so you have choices in control\nOf not only your financial present but also your future folks this does not happen by accident which you really need is a well thought out strategy for your retirement and the best thing you can do is develop it with the help of somebody who understands the big picture and all the moving pieces\nSo today we're offering you a chance to give them a call ... retirement evolution here's their number five to zero three nine nine six three for one\nYou can call and they put together a customize map a meaningful asset positioning about your own retirement it's going to be just for you and Karen tell us when they call this number what will the experience when they go in and visit with you\nWhen you come in and visit in that first appointment I think the first thing to really set folks minds at ease is to know that nobody's going to sell you anything you are not expected to buy something new ... which is going to be made to you\nThe first appointment and our firm is really an opportunity for us to get to know due to get to know what your goals are in retirement to understand\nMore about your specific financial picture\nAnd to make sure that you are able to pull that altogether even your own mind sometimes people can ended up first appointment where they thought they were wasn't quite where they are when they start digging through their documents and looking at him so that first appointment is a chance for us to just kind of be backed\nMinors and figure out where you are and then at the end of that appointment if you decide yeah I'm exactly where I Want to be thank you so much for your time I'm happy to shake your hand in part ways we're always here as a resource but at the end of that appointment if you\nThink that where you are today may not really be in line with your goals or do you think you just really want to get\nA second opinion a real detailed analysis that's what our second appointment has about\nThat second appointment we take all the information you provide to us our whole team worked on developing a very very detailed analysis our second appointment runs a couple of hours pretty easily and that is a way that you get to see a complete snapshot of where you are in your retirement picture today\nCompared to your goals and objectives and do those to match up and we really think that this analysis as a critical piece of moving forward in retirement\nSome strategies to help ensure that your money can\nLast as long as you do the analysis is completely customized it's based on your own unique circumstances not cookie cutter and there's no obligation so if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement here's number to call you can call right now during our show five to zero three nine nine six three four one\nK. your own personalized map you're meaningful asset positioning about your retirement that never again five twenty\nThree Ninety nine sixty three forty one I Want to remind you it never hurts to get a second opinion either right let's say you have a retirement plan but you maybe want to get a second opinion a second set of eyes to look at it if you don't have a plan now is the perfect time to get started five twenty three nine nine six three\nFor one again you're listening to retirement evolved with Kevin damn shit I'm ... and Karen is here to help you to\nCoach you maybe you have questions about Medicare because enrollment is now maybe you have questions just about retirement and general things we're talking about today are you going to have enough money to last\nYou too and through your entire retirement let me give you their website it's red Evo dot com R. E. T. E. V. O. dot com also you can go to Brett evil map\nDot com that's another place you can log on and learn more about them and play around with some various tools with your retirement again read Evo dot com or read evil map dot com\nKaren what am I don't have a pension but I have an IRA or I have a four one K. what could I Do to stretch the assets and those accounts so that they will be capable of lasting until I'm a hundred years old or more\nWell the way and I appreciate you giving that red ... map dot com website because those tools on there are fantastic and a great place for you to start doing some research on your own\nMap dot com website because those tools on there are fantastic and a great place for you to start doing some research on your own and I think it's really important because when we look at the four one K. the onus is really on the employee knocked the employee earth to fund that\nPlant so it's the individual not the employer who has\nTo figure out how they're going to stretch their assets so they're not exhausted prematurely that's because funds from a four O. one K.\nOr another type of qualified account are often required to come out each year beginning at the individuals they adjust Seventy and a half\nThis is what we call required minimum distributions or are in these for short and this time of year of course we're talking a lot to her clients who they've got to be taking there are indeed so if they hit Seventy and a half this year they're coming back into our office we're making sure those are good and structured for them\nSo in most cases at least currently these types of plants don't have features that allow the account holders to convert their assets directly into an income stream\nIn my experience I'd say maybe ten or twenty percent of the defined contribution plans like a four one K. offered that option to a new a tie it into an income stream the numbers increasing that that's kind of where we are today you know it really is important though to build an income stream for yourself\nGiving yourself a form of that longevity insurance we kind of talked about at the beginning of the show but deciding whether you're a good candidate for an annuity and if so what kind that's a discussion you should absolutely have with someone who understands how long have you with these work someone who is independent have\nAccess to lots and lots of options in the annuity world really someone who lives in breezes stuff every day and has a really deep understanding of it because\nThe products themselves are not always as trans parent and it's clear as we'd like them to be so if you've got questions about your retirement strategy if you're not really clear wet that income stream is going to look like maybe you've got a snappy little report in your hand that says hey here's how much I have\nBut you don't really know how that's going to play out over the course of your retirement then\nOf course you probably want to get a second opinion and we welcome you to come on into the office down with myself or John Moscow and member of our team and take a look at where you stand today and see maybe how you can maximize those assets to become that quality income stream that you need during your retirement\nAnd the first step is getting a customize map a meaningful asset positioning to get a detailed analysis showing your entire income picture\nAnd then covering areas where there may be opportunity for your assets to generate income during retirement we're talking about uh customize assessed that it's going to help uncover areas where there's opportunity to help grow your retirement nest egg so it does provide enough income for as long as you needed to\nWe're all living longer these days and that's what we're talking about today longevity if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement here's the number to call\nFive to zero three nine nine six three for one you can call right now start that map\nThat meaningful asset positioning five twenty three Ninety nine sixty three forty one and I want to add it never hurts to get a second opinion either if you have a retirement plan you want a second set of eyes than give us a call if you don't have a plan they can help you get started five to zero three nine nine six three for one\nTo get your money to last until

Karen\n... retirement evolution where they know that you've worked so hard investing and planning for this exciting time in your life\nRetirement it's either approaching or maybe you're already living that dream carrot advisors women and families she's the director of resolutions wealth solutions for women as she is certified in Social Security so she can guide you through the Web of benefits\nShe can show you the optimum time to claim and she's also Medicare specialist it's some room at time right now\nShe can help you with all of those things so care let's get back to what we're talking about we're talking about the steps that people need to take right now to increase the chances that there needs to last to age one hundred and beyond and\nYou're not giving us any help tips or anything like that but we're just talking about the fact that people could run out of money and we know that's the number one fear Karen of huge piece of their retirement income puzzle is Social Security and since we're focused on making our income last over the course of retirement what suggestions do you have\nFor claiming benefits for Social Security we've got to be\nSure that you're managing your Social Security retirement benefits wisely people approaching retirement age certainly should carefully consider when to start taking those payments and while you can opt to start payments as early as sixty two\nIf you don't need that income at sixty two it is usually in your best interests to delay those payments at least until full retirement age somewhere between sixty six and six to seven depending on when you were born that's when you become entitled to the fall or the\nOn reduced Social Security benefits so in some cases the right way to max my Social Security benefits to delay payments until sometime\nAfter what the government even considers full retirement age such as waiting all the way up to age Seventy when you do that when you wait for full retirement age to age Seventy this can be a real value in earning those delayed retirement credits because\nThey increase the monthly benefit that you get when you start taking your pain and that increased becomes permanent\nSo delaying make a big big difference for people and according to a recent analysis that we saw putting off taking benefits from age sixty to just to the full retirement age of age sixty six will generate about thirty three percent\nOff taking benefits from age sixty to just to the full retirement age of age sixty six will generate about thirty three percent more in monthly income while\nWaiting from sixty to the age Seventy ends up yielding a Seventy six percent\nJump in income so for example a person who would get a thousand\nDollar a month benefit\nAt age sixty two would end up if they waited 'til full retirement age that income would be Thirteen thirty three a month\nBut if they wait 'til age Seventy that income become Seventeen sixty a month so I said it before I'll say it again seek professional

a big way as markets continue to get tossed around that more economic data\nKeep pouring in and financial reports from various major companies are digested by analysts\nWhile key economic indicators are still showing signs of life in the economy along with a roaring job market and low unemployment the fact remains that interest rates are starting to creep up in a big way and are feared by some to put the brakes on this red hot economy\nHome sales in fact are slipping in some areas with prices falling as mortgage rates have increased giving pause to would be home buyers\nAnd then some companies are reporting that terrorists costs are starting to hurt their bottom line meanwhile the Federal Reserve continues to dig it heals into the ground on rates saying quote we no longer need to be stimulating the economy unquote\nIt is their job after all to keep inflation at bay this has some on Wall street a little bit concerned as the long term effect of higher interest rates and the potential economic slowdown are still unknown\nAnd when there's a little uncertainty out there Wall Street starts to move in a big way now what does that mean for your money and your retirement\nWell definitely it means more uncertainty if you only rely on what Wall Street provides and here at Mayfield financial we think that is no way to plan for your ...\nIndeed if you only rely on what Wall Street provides and here at Mayfield financial we think that is no way to plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nRetirement planning requires a careful thought process that involved many different moving pieces one of those is Social Security another could be a pension and for some the biggest piece is your retirement savings\nAnd when it comes to your retirement savings today baby boomers had been found to hold more stock market type investments than ever before\nPerhaps that's due to the lower returns sometimes seen in more of the fixed income type mutual funds on Wall street and it's also the result of this ten year bull market run\nHowever most financial advisors would agree you shouldn't have too much exposure to Wall Street or you're setting yourself up for potential failure what if another two thousand eight crisis hits us or worse\nThe drop in two thousand eight was so severe and so sudden most financial models didn't even fathom that kind of a loss retirement accounts across the country were decimated savings plans dash withdrawals put on hold income reduced\nWhy would we want to put ourselves through something like that again\nNow you've probably heard the saying before which some attribute to Albert Einstein but who really knows\nBut the saying is insanity is doing the same thing twice expecting a different result so what do we think the right thing to do is was definitely you don't want to do the same thing twice and have too much exposure to the stock market\nSo our retirement planning process at Mayfield financial is a little bit different\nFor starters it's one that doesn't entirely rely on Wall street we've got to get it through our heads that Wall Street isn't the only place they keep our money growing\nThere are much safer alternatives out there and even with that safety still have the potential to keep growing\nThis is what we call a safe money plan here at Mayfield financial it's an account set up and your name it could be\nAn IRA or rock ... roll over IRA and inherited IRA or a four\nO. one K. or even just regular saving money\nAnd in that account you can receive certain guarantees certain protections that even in the worst stock market you won't lose a dime\nWhy take the risk on a deep pass to score another touchdown when you've already got such a big lead\nSo that's why here at Mayfield financial and the state protection services we feel that what we do is so important we help our clients right here in southern Arizona take some of the wall street risk out of their portfolio\nWe do this using our expertise in safe money planning and create a customize plan for you\nOr at least a part of your portfolio is one hundred percent protected from Wall

worry free financial solutions I'm Nathan Federico a safe money retirement specialist in financial retirement planning there are two separate and distinct time periods in our lives\nIs the wealth building an earnings space this is a time when we are working trying to save\nIt's a time when we contribute to things like for one case to IRAs and other retirement planning accounts and during this time the stock market is one of the most powerful tools on the planet\nAnd should be used heavily in this accumulation phase especially when you're younger there's absolutely no doubting that\nThe second phase in retirement planning is the part where we transition from wealth building too well spending the second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRA\nWell spending the second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert assets\nInto income\nAnd in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you're a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan and it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some called this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of him and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one\nPensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now most of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement especially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives\nThis is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one case in IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee of income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four O. one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey sailed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they had the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety of principle and guarantees\nThis is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nOne that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial an estate protection services\nThis is what we call a safe money plan and we've been doing it here for over twenty five years\nAnd we believe and know that for at least they part of your portfolio your four one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income that you can count on year after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and ahead of inflation\nAre safe money plans do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four O. one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course raw IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive all with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no conditions paid by you\nSo what do you need to do\nYou need to take action now before it's too late take action while the stock market is near all time highs you need to take action now before the financial storms come and you know they will it's just a matter of when\nTo get more information on how a safe money plan could help protect your hard earned money and your four one K. and your savings and your IRAs all you need to do

because this conversation needs to continue you know I said last week\nI put my life at risk when we come on the air and I don't really mean that I'm being facetious but\nThis is not\nWhat we're gonna talk about today what we talked about the last couple of weeks folks this is not a popular message this is not one where people say hey kids let's gather around a mark in the smart money moves show is on\nA and he's got to talk about where the the cataclysmic the financial sue nominee that's common boy this is going to be great for us to hear\nThat that typically doesn't happen but if you can walk away today with a sense of you know what\nMark is that voice in the wilderness ... he and his team 'cause there's Jeff and there's cloudy and there's lily and we have to throw in a course Cleo the financial therapy dog because she's a big part of what we do and so Celia and Christie and Chris\nIs the three sees we call them anyway they're all part of what we do\nAnd we are that clarion call we are that voice in the wilderness because I'm ... with all those hurricanes and all the floods and all that kind of stuff as of late\nI'm that guy saying look the bridge is out ahead the bridge that's ahead or the ... that's a head it's out it's we're going to have to take a detour or you're going to end up being not where you want to end up being\nSo I'm willing to go out on that proverbial limb and say let the show being different let it be in its own environment versus all the other financial talk shows that are on the radio\nAnd that's not the pat ourselves on the back but it is to say this\nWe want to tell you what's going on to get you to pick up the phone and call us and have you come in and that's where we put the plan together that's where we address what we call the five boroughs of life so it's not a popular message and we're going to talk more about it here and just a little bit but\nYes you you if you're a avid listen to mark what about the salute them I didn't forget that so here we go to America [noise] and um\nYou if you're a avid listener mark what about the salute to I didn't forget that so here we go to America [noise] Adam\n... way back we talked about first responders and I kinda wanted to throw that out again today because of an incident that happened recently with a a dear friend of ours his wife got in a very serious car accident and he was relating this story that ah the people that showed up\nThe police the ambulance\nAnd then the the the surgeon at the hospital all these people it was like a symphony of making sure that this gal was going to be okay and so at listening to his story it made me realize that you know at the end of the day when things happen\nWe want those first responders to be at the top of the game right for us and we want them to have had a good night's sleep we want the surgeon to not be drinking caffeinated coffee we want them to I'm kidding but we want them to be at\nOut of the annuities out of the life insurance and you're right the markets backup yet have you hurt your annuities or have you hurt your life insurance now and we explain all that to you\n... come to a greater understanding and appreciation just adds to the leverage that these vehicles can provide so that's something that you really I encourage you to consider it to me it's all about positioning\nAnd part of this means that you have to have the guts the\nThe the the inter intestinal fortitude to go look I Want to address this now is it a popular topic you'd probably at this point of view I gather the kids around the room you're telling and go play go outside more what Mark's talking about is not for your ears it's PG Thirteen it's like oh my goodness the stuff he is saying is going to happen looked\nA Math Doesn't lie it just doesn't and so this movie if you'd like to see the trailer the two and a half minute trailer to the power of zero\nYou can email me I had a gentleman I emailed it to me [laughter] he emails evacuee goes this is scary stuff you know it's almost so scary people dismiss it they got there's absolutely no way this was going to happen so here's the question what if I'm wrong\nWhat is this stuff never happens have we heard you by how we position how we re deploy how we put you in in areas where we are protecting\nWhat you have a mass what you have created what you have grown the answer is no we aren't you know let's say I'm right you will come out on top you will have done the very\nBest the most prudent thing you can do at this juncture by positioning yourself for what I Believe\nIs inevitable this is not politically expedient aren't you just tired I Know I Am and I noticed Asian plays the ads and all I'm just tired I'm sick and tired I'll use I'm sick and tired frustrated over all the political ads that are running in the name calling and listen to that and to that and this and\nYou know what it's just I'm I'm done with it I mean can we taught those people all of them my opinion they don't really care and this is my opinion mark any can write me hate me hate mail whatever they're in this for them they're in this\nFor them it's not politically expedient for them to say you know what we have to raise taxes you have to cut benefits we have to switch the full retirement age for Social Security nobody wants to say that because then they're not going to get reelected but\nWhat I'm saying to you right now is so important that if you don't have\nThis you're not going to be positioned to take advantage of when the bad news comes\nSo here's a couple of questions I Want to ask you and oh by the way that two and a half minute trailer just email me mark at more F. S.\nDot com market more F. S. dot com emailed me I'll send you the trailer no hooks no catches no obligations just something you need to know in fact at the office we are we we we kind of kid ourselves back and forth we say you know what\nNot only do most people not believe this message\nMost financial advisors don't believe this message they are not talking to their people about what's\nComing because at the end of the day they're trying to sell you something they're trying to get you one more percentage rate of return\nAbout what's coming because at the end of the day they're trying to sell you something they're trying to get you one more percentage rate of return than the guy down the street or your funds are currently\nThis message if heated\nYou will look like a superstar within your family within your neighborhood\nWithin your world there'll be looking at you going well how did you how do you know this was coming well you know I listen to the smart money moves on Saturday and he's talking about this I went and saw the movie the power is zero I saw the trailer I've read the book I I I'm now more students now more aware of what's going on in our world and why\nPolicy kitchens are not talking about this\nThe presses are rolling the printing presses are printing money at an astronomical rate and as a result we are putting our kids our grandkids in harm's way\nWhat's the message the message is and then we'll talk about these questions here what's this mark what's the strategy here's a strategy your weight and you got your pen pencil and ... taxes are on sale\nToday pay the tax get it over with just be done with it\nPut your money in a in an environment where it all grows zero tax will mark what if the government changed the laws you know there's always that opportunity yet you're right but historically what has happened is if you're in certain vehicles where its tax exempt when you go to pull it out they grandfather\nThose policies those plans that are already in place so don't let that concern you what should concern you is what this trailer is two and a half minute trailer is saying to you\nSo don't do what the politicians are doing which is sticking their heads in the sand and hoping that it blows by them at least so that they can get reelected what you should be doing is saying what do I need to do today to protect my kids and my grandkids and my family what am I doing today to protect them\nThat's what the message is pay the taxes they get it over with taxes are on sale is that debatable will I get and get all these calls with Martin would any taxes are on sale look at look how much I'm paying my taxes yeah I get that\nBut if worse if we're spending a trillion dollars more than we're taking in every year and what what hasn't helped is the fact that tax rates were cut think about that I\nMean I Love Trump either what he's doing attach races were cut tax rates were cut in spending has been increased then it's a it's a double whammy right\nBut it's not too late for you give us a call two nine six four four six four to nine six four four six four you want to see the trailer to the movie happy to send that to you you'd like\nThe uh the pack at the optimize their packet happy to send that to you as well but here's some questions are you aware of all the challenges you are about to face\nIn the economic climate that we're in so those are the questions that's why you're listening to the show even Mark I'm getting a better sense as to what is going to be coming what some of our challenges are so that's question number one\nWhat if it was possible to have to develop a strategy\nThat would prevent you from being hurt by any of this stuff all the stuff I'm mentioning over the last twenty four minutes ways what if it was possible to develop that strategy so you wouldn't get hurt would you want to know about it if I'm waiting in the roadway the bridges out ahead the bridges out ahead go down this road\nAnd you might be thinking well as mark tricking me is that real really save as that\nBridges out ahead the bridges out ahead go down this road and you might be thinking well as mark tricking me is that real really\nSave is that it's safe so that would be question number to look the bridge is out ahead it is out ahead I'm here\nWarning you right now and then if we were to develop a strategy where you are always safe it's kind of a two part or here would that be good enough\nIf we only stay safe and we never make any money is that really what we know we're gonna help you get position so you can take advantage of what I said a little while ago when the stuff happens because\nWe will still be here it's just a matter of what will the state of the economy will be looking like and when things start to rebound don't you want to take that back up that's when everybody gets you for it that's when everybody's excited hey we've been through the worst I'm throwing you today on this show the life preserver it's like there it is if you catch it and you want to be real in\nThan your obligation is to pick up the phone and give us a call tonight six four four six four to nine six four four six four call me on my cell two three five nine for six five look at it it's not all about ready to return\nIt it's you having a plan to do you live too long should you die to students should what I'm Talking about happen\nAre you going to be prepared for those things I had somebody come into my office last week she came in and she said we just I just got a phone call that one of our clients their son forty five years old boom dropped over dead heart attack\nYou know that's sobering I'm sitting there thinking about things and doing some work and I'm thinking oh my goodness just he was driving heart attack it was over\nThat's really sad that's unfortunate that's that's horrific\nWhat is your plan should something like that happened to you we're going to talk about that coming up here and just a little bit we haven't mentioned long term care in a while and then look am I going to continue to beat this horse yes I Am because the message is so important you need to be prepared for what's coming\nAnd when you see this movie when we invite you and you come in and you see a Seventy five minute documentary about where we're going as a society\nIt will certainly be very sobering and you'll say mark I now know I Need to do something\nThe two and a half minute trailer will do that as well so make sure he emailed me market more F. S. dot com coming up we want to talk about long term care coverage and what it means because it's not about you going into a facility it's what happens to your family as a result of that is not about the risks it's about the consequences stay tuned for\nMore money\nAnd put them in a much better position you know it's great to say hey I said you're a bunch of money but yeah look at the new the new benefits is like there will down to almost no he's going to walk away he and his wife are going to say oh my goodness you position does better and gave us more benefits for less money\nI go yeah isn't isn't that what we're supposed to be doing and more financial that's that's why we're in business we are here to put you in a better position to position you so when this stuff happens that were just talking about and I had this conversation with him there Bob in their heads of an ongoing yeah we got we got to be prepared for this and you do\nSo please give us a call two nine six four four six four we are here for you this is about you this is not about more so what's the message to the messages the bridge is out ahead the bridges out ahead\nAnd people asked well how how can insurance companies do what they do mark you talk about a lot about insurance look I'm a a investment advisor representative\nAnd so I can put people in the markets I can charge them fees I can do all that for ... area and all that but the message today is is what I'm saying is true then you really need a safe haven you need to migrate\nTowards what the insurance industry is offering why is because they had been built they had been designed for times like this today is the day draw the line in the sand and say I'm going to call Mark I'm going to call the team right now I'm going to make an appointment what are you saying has captivated me\nOther people that I listen to I talked to I go and visit\nMark I'm going to call the team right now I'm going to make an appointment what are you saying has captivated me other people that I listen to I talked to I go and I visited there not this is not their message\nThe message is not pay the tax today and get it over with\nThat's not the message the messages max out your four one K. plant by term insurance match want you to ... make sure you do an IRA do this do that it's all about for the most part\nRates of return I don't want to play that game because it is a game don't want to do that won't\nGo there won't do that so give us a call two nine six\nFour four six four to nine six four four six four I have to mention this thing as well and I think it's important and it it dovetails very much so into what we're talking about when it comes to long term care and I I'm hoping my prayer my uh\nMy hope is that we can get Mr Harley Gordon to come to town he's a uh you'd probably one of the foremost\nA elder care attorneys and the country and he's written a book and so I said a little bit ago before the break we're going to talk about his book it's called the convert station called the conversation and this is what are\nYou know ... this conversation people don't want to have this how how apropos\nTo Harley's book\nAnd the subtitle is helping someone you love plan for an extended care event\nLook it's easy for me and I'm I'm not going to do this but it would be easy for me to take out all the statistics that are out there about how many people are going to need long term care how many people every sixty four seconds are diagnosed with Alzheimer's or dementia\nYou know what that does not connect with people we think as agents that it does it it will put people in a position of they start to worry they get anxious that this anxiety they've created say wow I Need to pick up the phone and call those guys one person every sixty eight seconds is being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia wanted that to me\nWell folks that doesn't encourage people to do the planning it just scares them into maybe not doing anything\nSo Harley's book really brings front and center the idea that it's not about now I'm Talking to the guy here when they get this it's us guys we have a hard time with a guy\nGuys men gentleman it's not about the risk of you ending up in a facility or having to have care that's not what's at stake here that's not the issue that's not what you're jeopardizing what you are jeopardizing and this is the real message\nIs the consequence of you not having a plan the consequences of what's going to happen to you I'm Sorry to your family\nYour kids your grandkids your spouse should something happen to you this is Carol is\nIn fact if you don't have a plan it is likely that will it will tear your family apart\nIt will tear your family apart\nNot having a plan and not properly funding it can disrupt all efforts to secure a sense of financial viability as you and your family move into the future that's what not having a plan will do\nYou know what we have a deep as a gay guys again women you can don't have listeners but us guys we by nature heavy deep seated aversion to thinking about anything truly awful occurring do you like nobody nobody gets up in the day hey what if\nBy nature heavy deep seated aversion to thinking about anything truly awful occurring do you like nobody nobody gets up in the day hey what if I get in a car accident today what if I have a stroke whatever ... nobody likes to think about that stuff\nNor do they like to think what if I have a need for care what if I'm going to have to have somebody paid me feed me clothe me take me to doctors appointments\nAnd so as a result because nobody thinks about the subject is dismissed and that's what Harley Gordon's contention is that being more the case certainly when you're talking about hey you need to own a long term care insurance policy\nSo what Harley's hope when he put together this book was to change your mind by altering how the subject is talked about\nWhat I Hope to do what my goal is when I have this conversation you had the conversation and nobody wants to have is to say this\nIs that when I'm done I Want you and your mind as say mark Jeff really the conversation the consequences are too severe\nThat I Need to take action I Need to do something because I don't want to put I don't want to have my kids my grandkids my spouse left to deal with this\nSee one way or the other you're going to be kept safe if you have an incident you have an extended care event they are going to find a way to take care of you we know that we're here in America right somebody will rise up something will happen whether you have money you don't have you will be taken care of\nThat's not the problem the problem is what is going to happen\nTo your family it's about your commitment to protect your family regardless of what happens to you the book talks about as he says you're the serious and often irreversible consequences providing care\nCan have on those you invited into your life I think about that\nThe consequences to those you love you said yes to the altar\nYou now have embraced over the years you saw them through elementary school and middle school and high school and college and now they have careers and now are they going to have to put their life on hold\nSee we have that conversation that's a conversation a lot of people don't want to have it hits you square between the eyes of like oh my goodness Well Mark I don't think that's ever going to happen well okay let's have a plan\nJust in case it does happen look you're going to be fine but it's the consequences to those you love and you care about those are going to be the ones that you might be doing irreversible damage to should you not have a plan in place\nThat is what Harley's book is about\nA I Believe it's in reprint right now they're they're printing more and so we're hoping to get some of those as well that may be a give away you you want to call you say mark a when you get a copy of the conversation yes what do I have to deal you have to come in you have to have the conversation with us and then we'll give you the conversation\nBut look if you don't want to have your family put their lives on hold to take care of you then you need to have a plan in place that's our our encouragement to you have a plan in place\nBecause this is what Harley says and I'll conclude with this he says what most people don't understand is that extended care is not a series of risks that what happened to them but rather a set of serious if not irreversible consequences\nThat happened to them\nBut rather a set of serious if not irreversible consequences that would happen to those that\nYou love this is risk versus consequences\nThat's really at the end of the day what this is about so give us a call two nine six\nFour four six four to nine six four four six four call me on my cell two three five nine for six five two three five nine for six five will you have this conversation with us at more financial we hope that you will\nA couple of months ago I talked about the perfect financial plan\nThe perfect financial plant is that possible we believe it it is in fact society dictates to us that whatever it is that you as an industry put together it needs to be simple it needs to be efficient\nAnd so we're happy to let you know that we have figured that out\nThis does not need to be complicated in fact many people will come into the office wanting it to be complicated say whoa nearly let's pull back a little bit with this does not have to be complicated it can be simple but simple doesn't mean it's not going to be a fish", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "27", "locations": [["Pittsburgh", 40.44062, -79.99589],

D. is with us in Sacramento, California Hi J. D. how are you\nA Dave I'm good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we've got a B that three eight I'm working on three B. and we just went through a few uh we coordinated it thank you and\nYeah and my ... when the ten percent [noise] but I hear you on your show the twenty percent you'd prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there then been one of those too so I'm just wondering what\nWhat makes the difference between ten and twenty or said\nOkay a good really really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down is our favorite mortgage\nOkay not one All right uh the end when somebody's buying a second home I pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house unless you can put down twenty percent on your second because you've got the equity coming out of the first\nRight in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down and you have what's called an eighty percent loan and our eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you where the standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an F. I. J. loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. stands for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on un lose money on the foreclosure\n... so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay at ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you were in a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage you got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone if you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference\nVersus ten percent and so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down you get ... on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the P. M. I. when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company ... of and then they will drop the PM I later after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly\nHigh compared to this country make any difference\nKnow it doesn't make any difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just 'cause you're in California they don't like okay I don't want your map doesn't count you know we don't do that so you ...\nThere's still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just because you're in California they don't like okay you ... you know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're the higher the whole process market you're in the more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent\nI'm not requiring twenty percent but you get to you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage\nTo not have this thing to me I Am I\nYeah I mean because you had are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you\nRight so that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but it's so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent then keep counting on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset\nWithin appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PM I dropped so you're not known for Twenty years\n'cause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it but it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can 'cause then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer doing baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't have to waste that's what we that's the goal we all have well those of us that\nAre in tune with being smart anyway\nNick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's good to talk to you you too man what's up\n[noise] okay so I'm twenty five ah I've I've done pretty well for myself\nUh I had a dilemma though my ... cars have a car it's a a a two thousand nine Chrysler three hundred bucks to ask thirty eight model what the big game in it and it's a hot yes I paid well below Kelley Blue book value and I have\nFive to six thousand dollars worth of equity in the car mhm and I've been listening to you and going through your baby steps if he won't be tough for me but I think I Need to sell the car I Know you're going to tell me to sell the car and you use the money to finish my murders based on\nWhat is your and what is your car worth a private market is twenty three who I think\nAnd and you said you're twenty five and you're doing pretty well for yourself tell me what that means\nThat means I have a good job of got Twenty one thousand dollars invested a retirement or have no credit card\nDebt mhm no I don't know what are you single I'm Single and what's your income\nBy a gum is about forty five fifty thousand dollars a year give or take a little bit with overtime\nIs this your only dead on the car\nThat's my only debt and how much do you do on it\nOh sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty two dollars and Twenty one steps\nAs a single guy can't you pay that in a year or maybe you have no life but you get to keep the car no life you don't see the inside of a freaking restaurant unless you're working there\nI've been doing that Dave out of the ... yeah I get I mean I've been doing everything and that but\nCan't I mean can you can probably pay sixteen thousand an ear and making fifty grand if you're single ...\nYes sir I keep the car okay\nLet me tell you how to let me tell you how do the analysis is not how much you love the car or a little card is although both are valid because it is\nOkay let me tell you how\nTo let me tell you how do they tell us it's just not how much you love the car or how cool a card is although both are valid cause it as a seriously cool car but the analysis is this can you be debt free up your house and under two years the answer\nIs yes and all your vehicles with a total of all your vehicles was less less than half of your annual income and the answer is fairly yes and you really love the\nShow you're willing to fight for cheap and don't have more than half your annual incomes hot up especially goes on in values is from one car guy to another caller guy\nOkay I got lots of cars so they are less than one percent of my worst show just your son I have toys go get some money first and then you can have toys and this is that I ...

Ramsey or you go about your life and your\nMoney and as I recall a AAA eight to five five two to five AAA eight to five five two to five [noise] Danny starts\nOff this hour in Des Moines Iowa heart Danny welcome Ramsey show\nI Dave how are you better than I deserve how are you\nI Am fantastic it's such an honor to be able to speak with you today and uh you and your advice and books have changed my husband and I live right I'm so excited well I'm honored to speak with you how can I help\n[noise] well I Am wondering my husband and I have five children together ah he has three children from a previous marriage and I have two children I'm a previous marriage and we are currently on baby step number two\nAnd we just have a few thousand dollars left to go before we're able to kiss our debt goodbye mhm and so we are planning on a\nYou know helping our children are calling as much as we can ... and with five of them we realize that could be a significant expense and all five children currently have\nFive twenty nine plans that had been funded by cash gifts and things they received from their grandparents over the years good\nUm so his boys are are significantly for it\nSo his boys are are significantly further in math and my girls are my girls are quite a bit younger [laughter] um but we just kind of want maybe around about ... on what we should plan for each child or how to how each child through college because I feel like\nIt could be such an enormous amount of money with five of them but we also want to help them out as much as they can sell\nOkay there's a couple of ways you can calculated um as far as your target amounts and if you know your target amounts you're wise to ask for that then you can back into how much you need to be doing\n... the ones that got a little bit of a head start 'em they may be a little bit older are so it might come out fairly even I don't know spends on how much of a head start there is and it also depends on where you're thinking about going to school so\nIf I were in your shoes it doesn't sound like what's your household income\n... I'm a little over a hundred thousand [laughter] okay are you guys millionaires\nAnd we are not yet okay but you're on your way we are I mean here's the thing five kids going to school how old are they what's age range\nAnd that's where every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah I always like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that there are and they all like Thirteen hundred dollars only are\nYou know and let's get the car paid off and build up an emergency fund and go that route I'm that'll make sense but but um\nYou know we're teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been doing this stuff that we talk about for a while and yeah we're going we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up an emergency savings and begin long term investing\nA wedding we're going to be generous with some of the money and uh so the whole thing that you get when you got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this meeting no bank account\nYou know he's a young young guy getting started is that uh it's real easy for all that money to just disappear\nYeah and the egg thing you've got to get him doing is being intentional with every dollar\nOkay I'm a I'm I'm all up she said yes we start out with\nUm I well I get a bank account going like you're talking about on a debit card for that and then you know I I think he just lay it out and say okay you know where do you want to be in five years and what are the steps that are going to get you there and so you know how much are you going to spend on entertainment\n... how much are you going to spend on what's it take to keep the car running gas wise\nAnd your insurance and your car payment and then just just take this income and give every dollar a name ride down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do in about eight minutes you know yeah there's not there's not a lot to this deal is not like it's complicated\nOkay yeah we got some apple or set up for like um a merger Soufan and the ... like a car like emergency fond of are you going to your car stuff you have things we do have savings going on about ten percent of his ... home we put in your savings Warren\n... well no I I Would I Would work the baby steps I mean not so Couzin dollars aside as ... bond and then after that I got his car paid off and then after that I'd have a fully funded emergency fond of three to six months of expenses in his case he be rich if he had no debt and five ... five grand and savings Whitney\nYeah it'd be really well off so\n... and ... and then I Would start is investing long term start talking about a Roth IRA and those kinds of things and even start talking about maybe some additional saving so he can have his own place\nOkay thank you very much\nHey thank you for calling it appreciate your joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Vicky is with us in Wilmington North Carolina\nHi Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I have a question about an inherited [laughter] um my husband and I are small business owners and we have\nA significant amount of debt with a business and our personnel which is a lot to the business for ... years during the recession and by several years ago and that we have a twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance that we um [noise] my husband had hoped that we can\nUse for the kids' college have one daughter that's in her freshman year of college now and then another one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and a baby face and\nSo this business of making money it's struggling it makes many now that we still have a good bit of debt fan of how much as it might profit um profit uh [noise]\nGosh probably well I have to say probably it doesn't make enough to support us over the past year but um and how long are you going to live in this mythology [laughter]\n\nAnd so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline that in the next six months it's going to start supporting our family after all these years and making enough to start getting rid of some of his death or we're going to close it and get a job because I don't think you're making any money\n[noise] um am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay our cell tentative his mind was bringing home I'm about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing your you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of the business\nYeah well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars well we can do that we had a lot of how much data God\nI've got about fifty two K. and leap personally had about um Ninety six K okay\nWhere are you in the business doesn't have any that your son personally for it okay so that all is damaged she got on the Internet if you have a hundred dollars in debt and you have a hundred and you have a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNow that's all we make that's what I mean we are happening\nAll income when you do your taxes is a ...\nIt has banned that we're me like an account to adjust something there that we're taking distribution of a profit and\nThat doesn't change it right but that's how much we're ... we're paying ourselves trying to do business okay years so you need to find out what the profit if you don't know what I mean\nYou get back you give me three different answers so you need to find out if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on her does want to hear you got other problems\n[noise] right yeah\nAnd you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars does not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go to clean up his dad gummed ... what made\nOkay but it ... the only way that makes sense is if you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the businesses making a profit\nAnd if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts mhm or if you want to pay off the fifty two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars you you ought to be all do that but you guys aren't living on a plan to businesses not on a plan on your personal lives on a plant I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got ... in the mail today and what do they start at ... ...\nA good start ... and I'm going to send you a copy of the book entree leadership on the business side so uh but because here's the thing you need to be going no no I'm not going to quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nYou know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that when you did fine tune in give I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\nAnd so we need to fine tune our systems at the business the profit and loss statements the the budgets at the business and so we know exactly\nWhere every dollar at the business is going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income\nAnd then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of that\nBetween these two different sets of that\nAnd work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go if you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the ... the debt and throwing a system at your business in the system in ...\nSo I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at\nThe ... just sold it to that and I'll go to the ... and throwing a system\nAt your business in the system and detailed budget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem so the problem goes away\nAnd the twenty nine thousand as part of the solution to that but the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and at work pulled on him when he gave me a copy of the book entree leadership this list that I ...\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOkay things are getting ... out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the personal financial info up half\nYeah then for for me I Would say it's just you know everybody's different in the way they approach\nOr this debt free journey\nRight Lindsey over here she's an excel guru in geek in loves to see a split out I'm a put a thermometer up there and let me hold her in\nThe whole thing and get me to the top ... more goal driven in that and we had it All right but on the refrigerator right when we went on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in debt is kind of like you know when you're an alcoholic you got it Alcoholics Anonymous now this was it it was like hey we're the ... were in debt\nI Am not I mean it was our way of being honest and I end up front and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they are into our homes\nCell phone and people look at you look curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nYou know it was a little bit of both I mean our family was very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders off and realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and taking on that and I'm like\nWhy you know like when we got to the store and get it in the beginning but people kept saying oh no just just go by that you know you know you can paid off soon no no no that's not how I Wonder also right\nAnd you know

hundred thousand and four ones and Ross\nOkay good and uh what do you owe on the land and home\nA five hundred and twenty\nOkay All right well the income produced off of\nSix hundred and fifty thousand dollars let's just usually that's the uh two fifty and the four hundred you got those two numbers mhm if those two were invested in just rent round numbers just to make this easy if it was ten percent that'd be sixty five thousand dollars a year\nShe doesn't get to keep the land in the house in that scenario does she\nKnow ... camp for service for half a million dollar debt was sixty five thousand our income and raise kids right\nYes okay so you're under insured if your goal was for her to stay in that property upon your death now if she liquidated inputs seven hundred thousand\nThe equity of that buys a two hundred thousand dollar house has five hundred in her hand plus has two fifty plus has four hundred now she's got over a million dollar she's got paid for two hundred thousand dollar house and she can live on a hundred thousand dollars a year then are coming off of a million one\nDoes that make sense so if that's your plan you're okay but if you wanted to stay on that property and continue to live there you don't have enough insurance do you see how I'm doing that\nYes are there okay so what's the goal which one [noise]\nUh\nWould you want her to stay

some say the boss is worth what you pay for the phone number triple eight to five five to too far that's AAA\nEight to five five two to five\nOr ... is with us from Columbus ohio ... how real\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nHere you're kind of on a constant loop and our home my daughter called the uncle day so [laughter] um so I wanted to know um we watched that a lot and ah one of the shows or someone said something about a pack of\nAnd uh at the time he laughed and it was pretty funny apparently but I just wanted to know since my wife and I are worth saving up and working to a shorter on ranch and a razor Packers I Want to know if you knew something that I didn't and maybe a\nLike people pretty poor all the time and some of them they make people rich\nBut as I as do other running a business um called cattle you know and then as a business and when it ceases to be a business and starts to be a fad um or never becomes a business because all of this was a fad than there you go so what is the deal what are you ... what do you get out of alpacas what's the end product\nProduct the fleece or you can use me [noise] um you can turn into sweaters and\nFox

[noise] um well I work\nAs a truck driver and I'm never home so I'm On a blind eye was later in life retirement and I'm Wondering I'm would be a good idea and oh to invest that extra money to put out in Middle East now you know that's a\nGood good question how old are you a fifty fifty four near single okay and how many years do you think before you buy a house\nOkay All right cool\nWell as long as you've got more than five years I Would use a simple gross stock mutual fund or a series of them\nFor something like that I probably would just using this in the index fund because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I've started to uh ... five hundred fund an index fund\nAnd use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nAnd that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar thing Scott and sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and I 'cause I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick question uh so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a a nurse and that that I'm Wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nI'm so my question is if they work for me to go to cool now I'm thirty two years old my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now after a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand\nA year and um so if I go to school it's going to cost me three years of not working\nOn that tuition of around Ninety thousand dollars mhm uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful uh together would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm\nSo uh but it's a what do you make a year now are right now around Seventy thousand\nOkay so you're saying this is going to cost you a three hundred grand three years or three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than on any out of pocket and can you live on her income while you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school uh but I don't think I can cash into thing right now because I I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr or putting and Lisa putting a down payment for a house next year before I start school so\nThat then you need to wait until you can pay for school I Would never in Thirty years are doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school\nOkay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter of when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with not agreeing\nYeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow it um I can see it pretty easily ... how long does it take to go through the class again or go to guy ... it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nOr thirty grand a year yeah and and she makes what\nShe makes a hundred and fifty thousand\nYou can't cash flow thirty granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA love note when I'm not in coal\nIf you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and ... thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school\nI I I'm Sorry fifty thousand it it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year I thought you said it was Ninety thousand I'm Sorry I I got that wrong if they did sixty thousand a year\nSeems high yeah it it it is a it's a it's an expensive program yeah go to a less expensive program\nThat but cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it figure out a way to pay for it if I usually\nGo you know there's certainly having all stocked stocked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student\nLoans whether they finish or not and then you've got what's known as a freaking mess and\nSo I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that my life happens dude and the last thing you want the only time debt works is if everything works\nOther than that that doesn't work\nAnd say wait till you to stay away from it thanks for the call\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua ... is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nSo basically I Am stuck in between whether I should file for bankruptcy or just go ahead and start paying 'em all my debt off um that Nobel basically all my debts except my car are aimed collection so that's why that's the only reason I'm basically contemplating\nUm bankruptcy why are they only go actions\nUm they're like oh medical bills um one is that is a car that guy um brief oh the cause of a\n... I lost my job and that I think I think like a phone bill and then there too mhm\nOkay so how much is the repo bill\n[noise] um [noise] that one's actually [noise] only like a couple of grand ... it gets what I have on there is a nine nine thousand four hundred and forty five dollars from an old apartment\nMhm how long ago was that three and a half years ago\nOkay and how ... how much how much my medical data began\nI Would say about two thousand\nAnd one of the doubt if you go\nTo the rest of it is it just makes the narrow like ... or ... I think that phone bill and always payday Lowe is well you know so\nYou're you're totally that's less than twenty thousand dollars\nRight and then I have um my car which is a twelfth out mhm okay and what do you make it here\nI'm a little bit for forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm and you're single or married you're married older\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday\nThe happy birthday does she work outside the home\nI'm no she stays at home and takes care of her daughter\nOkay good well let me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that debt is not the problem is is a symptom of something else that's going on I'm right\nAnd it sounds like you guys have never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment so your car gets ... and you end up with a mess\nYes they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if\nShe might do maybe I'm if it did that and make you have zeroed out all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change their habits that causes this mess in the first place you'll be back right where you are someday do you agree\nYeah there you know so we really need to get under that does bankruptcy doesn't solve that uh you got to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think you're bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and have done

out who are talking to you that was like one of the first video that I Will look it up with out of it that collect bears you know a ...\nIt don't it doesn't change my answer to whether it's nine

five were opening up a couple of lines for that right now Heather is in the lobby of Ramsey solutions from Spokane, Washington where the question\nI Heather Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up and I just finished baby step three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three bean before actually lives on to babysit for\nWas not a magic cancer of the concept or the or the critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this if you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you're screwed up your retirement Mm right yeah\nEnd up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things and most people that means you know\nThree years four years something like that um but if you're if you're fifty nine it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you in twenty eight on friday okay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two\nBut you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got a you know how to land a pay it off in a few years because of that\nYou're not you're you're still going to return multi millionaire you know if you do that at it but if you stayed out for Twenty years been called that baby steps ... what I'm that's yeah that's kind of how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nLike just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so the thirty years' old your your game own on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for us not sooner and uh you will of saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multi millionaire you say I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go yeah that's all it is I thanks for stopping by thanks can't\nOpen phones AAA eight to five five to to find Julian is in New York City Hi Julian how are you know\nI ... it can you hear me okay\nI can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm In a a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any debt to after graduating medical school but at the game the residency included\nI I decided to specialize um and uh\nDid you get a phone or what\nUm uh yeah I'm not certain is that what I Want to do yet I no no no I'm I'm asking how you did that\nOh um yeah so so if they get from my father and my grandparents um wow I Am very very very appreciative of how\nGood you should be that's amazing wonderful so how can I tell\n'em yes away when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control this funny 'cause it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm so I'm\nA yeah I was I was given control this money and uh I've been given a very good financial advice my father who's helping me manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's actually back in the rain stopped me or I Would like a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of money for a living expenses um and I've said that about five thousand dollars from\nSome small side jobs at hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and how that myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWell the the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get through through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in savings um and the two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on three months renewal basis until I needed to take them out to pay my tuition and then I Would just reinvent the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that and the only reason is is that the bills basically or bonds and a bond interest rates were yields a go\nGo down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing in the interest rate environment so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in the bills you could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nOr as interest rates increase show that's not a very safe investment an environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross income type phones but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything\nIf you want to keep it all very very safe that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value\nAnd you're not able to do that then the whole you know is like a ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing And Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julian ... debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to trying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum or you've defeated your own purpose Detroit yourself in the foot so to speak so um\nThat's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe or if you want to go toward something that's fun but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now a possible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how are you\nEven though I'm great thank you so much for taking my call sure\nI I just wanted to thank you for all you do um this December will mark ... it's been seven years since my husband and I have paid off that I'm following their plans to go for that\nUm but my question today is um my sister and I were a little concerned about our parents' killer and hoping you could give us some advice on how they could got them um my parents live in North Carolina and they live in a flooded area of flood prone area\nAnd I'm so every time the hurricane come through um they they experience some flooding it on their on their property at their home as well as my dad business\nAnd we were just wander and what you can end as far as shit they sell it and then um they have no doubt that they do have um some savings and my mom has a ticket for one\n... and often does this property blood\nWell in non um it flooded and it was it got like forty inches in the house and I think about ten feet in his shop\nAnd then two years ago um it got and my dad shop I think about three feet or so and it almost at length about six inches from getting in the house again\nAnd I'm ... ... there's only been two major flood but um but they're in their sixties and it it's very emotional for them in any town a farm and it's just\nIt's throughout this past down we actually packed the or I didn't and my sister was able to help them I was out of state but they packed up all their belongings and let them put them away and you know because they were afraid that\nThey're so what are the most who is living there has become more painful than not living there\nAnd those are the fear of rising water even the fear is not founded we once in Twenty years is not that bad but bottom line is is that he's developed a phobia for them\nThey're they're not of a fun living there and why wouldn't they moved [noise] right [noise] I don't care I mean the actual threat a flood statistically with what you've given me I wouldn't be that concerned about but if they're actually panicking Everytime the weather person comes on says it's raining [noise] then it's time to move 'cause it's not fun to live there\nAn emotional decision but that's an okay decision wrong\n[noise]\n\nYou've heard me talk about our deep there for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim\nOf the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million twenty six percent of them have to borrow money from family or friends twenty two percent of

can I help [noise]\nOkay so um [noise] I mean my wife we send me just\nThe one man or a hundred and eighty thousand dollars and we're not really a green aren't aware of this money should go oh my goodness won't happen where did you get a settlement that large from a I got in a pretty bad motorcycle accident ... how are you doing\nA A R A M I'm blessed to be here I Am actually\nYou're physically coming back\nA yes or my body recover great so I'm happy I can do just a little bit or I'm a movement issues in my shoulder but besides that I'm buying\n... you got any future surgeries coming up a no okay well good luck I'm Glad you're I'm Glad you're doing a good that's awesome okay same so uh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on\nSo me and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house mhm but\nPerhaps some leftover but she's not agreeing with me with that mhm and I just wanted to your your opinion on what you think would be the better move\nThat's huh well she's not agreeing with you I don't know why she would agree with me [laughter] but anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo get it and we have about forty five thousand dollars\nAnd ... I Would pay that off and I would hold twenty back for an emergency and put the rest as your down payment if I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with that\nLaying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble and so on and so\nMy vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she would answer to listen to make now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new list and I'm trying to get here on board mhm she's not really to come ... they are also having trouble getting her on board with the plan as well yeah\nI can imagine so um I\nHighly recommend you don't do anything until you can come into agreement okay because you're going to make a mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this we we have to we have a rule\nWe have to do nothing until we can come into agreement on large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd uh so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nUh when I was there when I asked when I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership\nYes sir you think so why she fresh rubber\nI think that me and my me and her mother would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the clients is free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you OK because if you go by yourself it'll cause of divorce does you're going to get more and more and more and more\nExcited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two classes with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive\nBut uh but don't go by yourself do it'll cause problems hold on I'll have Kelly pickup I'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is\nAll right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon Dave how you doing gay\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nWell that that's good faith um\nBoth my wife and I are at Pew coordinators ... get free\nAnd we need your wisdom and guided something where we also have a little disagreement [noise] um last you see that her son got very we learned in Miami how come out really knowing knowing that we would never probably see the money again okay um\nOh good money to help them out really knowing yeah knowing that we would never probably see the money again okay um\nWhy would you do that you're ...\nYou know what that's a good question [laughter] that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't talked for about a year ago I\nTouch with every with that aspect of it but um we volunteered to pay for the material that they take a class which they did but in the end they didn't discipline Metallica our principles and or building a ... ... ... well\nAfter six months we decided that they weren't trying to make the U.S back anything we kind of let them you know we weren't alone and be more money because they had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and and there was no communication to indicate me on her famous back\nWell you know life goes several months later they're only vehicle broke down and um and it could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work this is where it gets sticky my 'em knowing that my wife ... parents trashed would be dispersing funds to all their fisheries recruited him we\nBoth agreed to front about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding that he would immediately pay us back when the checks in some of the logic was it they were a bar in Columbus and that they were already ... her parents stress\nAs it today we have not distributed that many but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here it's going to be distributed next couple of weeks\nWe wouldn't do what you do in the meantime they've they took out I'm a five or a a thousand dollar loans to pay off for months of ... will do rent the otherwise they'd be um evicted in our daughter live just does not want to work to help out\nSo my angle is there a settlement of mirrors and because we have not given distributed responsibility pain backyard alone I have strongly suggested ... and I I think that's about as far as that goes this is my wife's side\nThat my wife write the check to them have them

I worked for the postal service they have a get a loan debt of like um about Fifteen thousand dollars [laughter]\nAnd um I have two friends one of them is I'm asking me to go for a business\nOr like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking a loan for that and my other friend if I'm all for me like to go buy a house with him to the share like a two family house so I take one apartment he thinks the other\nAnd it's going to be of course with a mortgage lonely too so I wanted to know what should I Do\n... ... well we tell folks not to borrow money around here if\nYou listen to the show very much the shortest path to wells and peace in your finances is to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships as the only ship that won't sale\nSo um what that means is that if you still want to remain friends with both these guys I Would suggest you say no because at the end of the stories are nightmare\nGoing in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you do know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners or somebody to buy a house and then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay his half or you don't pay your overcame a year and a half is a\nPrecursor to the ending of a friendship and a foreclosure\nSo no I wouldn't do either one of those and that's my reasoning\nI think you'll have a lot better life if you avoid both of those paths and you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without bet\nThey just start small\nWe started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down to the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nWell you figure out a way to get going\nAnd you what we call bootstrap it and it works but you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply in debt about subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology Thomas is with us in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you\nDave thank you very much for taking my call sure what's up I'm I just graduated with a degree in actuarial science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour why\nI I've been applying and applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do\n... well I I Would assume that the primary job for that would be an insurance companies correct\nYeah I I've [noise] through the end my last year of school I got very turned off the actuarial science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything because every one kid everyone wants you to have experience and\nI don't have the experience and I I graduated early so I did I did summer classes and they can't do internships for summer classes\nSo kind of what kind of went into a job or you try it into a financial analyst financial um\nWhat kind what kind of natural job or you tried into\n\nFinancial analyst financial I'm like I've I've been even doing accounting like account Mabel any ... receivable [noise] you know entry\nLevel stuff or you just get your foot in the door I'm OK well\nHere's here's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman will tell you this as well go to the ... show dot com and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes and applications without relationship or ...\nUm I'll give you an example uh we have eight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year\nWe had Fifteen thousand the applications\nFor those moderate hires you get lost in that room and it's\nNot that I don't want to answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people is just logistically not reasonable and so what ends up happening is you get lost in the stack of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just 'cause I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are\nEver but we would give him an interview and pull their pull their resume out of the stack you got to get out of the pile you know\nAnd so some of these places you're trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that she married a kid plays soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that'll put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired an almost never happens that'll decent job anyway\nI mean if they're hiring just bodies you can get on something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about trees and that will be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a higher but we will at least talk to them\nAnd you know what might be a very short conversation no you don't qualify investment or looking for at least we'll talk to them and get the resume out of the pile if somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that and listen to the kids on the show he'll help you and all this stuff is very gracious false out there but I think you can leave some\n\n\n\n\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q ... when getting your mortgage you really think he cares about your longer money goes boy doesn't\n[laughter] but this is an amazing story very well done thank you very well not well\nYou did exactly what I Try to get doctors to most dogs come out and go finally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole break in life mhm\nI deserve a new house a new car I deserve a trip and they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's crazy understood all you do would you you just kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought\nYeah 'cause now if I mean you make three hundred four hundred five hundred wherever you make it ... you're going to be unbelievably well for him so you said your how thirty thirty one thirty one wow\nThis fabulous income congratulations I guess I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you had have good tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader\nOr I Would say my parents or my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they I talk a lot about you and we're encouraging me to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely own and it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAn other planets I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later I Am a final payment yeah\nIt's going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later in the final payment\nYou know you pay them almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ... ... you were on which is pretty incredible but you're making four Fifteen minus taxes which takes a big chunk of and so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now are you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging\nAnd just completely lean to show as you're going along you're you're hitting this thing when you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah Fifteen to twenty a month to only given month\nAt what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in war you before the before kind of the ... which kind of flip for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest ones first I had a total of twenty different student loans and so they were to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that\nAnd then I started to have some more hope that I Would be able to pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I just looked at it and it was like there was no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking them off the little baby ones when you first started yeah and that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost deaf in his debt snowball really kicked in for you then again nobody was supposed to do unless you know that there's just going to work\nMhm wow wow wow wow wow wow\nAll right so what is the big takeaway when someone says oh I'm I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is just to stop burning from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never got a day and I once I faced it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd realized that I'm the one who signed the papers balloons you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd they are their income as much less oh sure they know what mine is but I learned most\nPeople's [noise] [laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget that from my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card debt in the past they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card and um you know make sparked more purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles from them\nYou know there was a there was a sense of character that came from them that they cause you'll be able to do this that's what I was thinking\nYeah very good very good well I'm proud of you know they are well done very well done what a great great story we got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next
