I Would I ran into um\nWhat's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Kavanaugh hearings said he was a total jackass during those hearings is coming out of where I was going in and I said center Sean Hannity how are you\nWe had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with um I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out of the ... ballot box\nI have I have a fear and when I say feel with um regarding myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself what I had always said you know it's just an old man of the ... that's why I say I have a fair I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the old me will come out and they asked me if I'm with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response would go by what but I think they pick and choose their targets doesn't exactly\nWell maybe but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half\nMaybe they aren't the largest and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to top\nCrazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk away\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past just caught then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the last that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pastor what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of and Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor it in I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that there's a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated you know some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am ... so do you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you\nSay that I have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama said we're never coming back\nWell the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say

has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country and come racing towards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can have what you know you can have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us into were horrible people uh especially when the

Scott and that's for governor and Rhonda said this is a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle of people showing up in the panhandle you got a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back\nTowards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it's ... if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against the British and we have Britain's team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers progressing calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall hold but people have got to get out the vote 'em we see

Indiana don't vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly\nWe've got a hold the seat Heller seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada

president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide ear\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the

amazing the criticism that has been out there for what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walked right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security and made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's\nSpent a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any end it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nIn Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping a finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column ... my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question let on the mark I mean there's actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president's ... who basically tried to overthrow the constitution and making ... for life there and done with the Venezuelan\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos pictures from the more so again no great great mystery this is\nThe work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American government look bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border\nWall with a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ... says mommy seem to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws come in according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered by the way those books that are actively don't want to control the border\nWhy is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get it just added stuff if that's the principal\nWell what I'm I'm married I was I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he says and people rush across our border being at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here are coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number\nPeople rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\n... ugly or something we don't want to be hurt and also it was undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff on the probably been like you know I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to\nShow they are being put in the ... in the middle of this I'm simply we as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible raunchy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I taking the time I think more than any other person immediate in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence and\nOn the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding what looked like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is being looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nThere without question of what you just describe age most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who will control the border\nDisney Trump so I think that just they just want to silence and they're going to just ...\nI I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats\nOh boy if the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada I think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana\nAnd we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this is real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nLarry Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go full for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirements\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBecause Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nMaxine Waters is a committee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a

that the two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand tend to mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nThe crumbs back increase to regulate watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a

S. dot com and\nI'm [noise]\n\nLooking back at it as a ... show so nice to have you with us this afternoon and are the saving depending on where you are around the country\n\nThe politics of the political caravan Democrats clearly want to use this caravan of illegal immigrants coming to the U.S now and almost ten thousand stronger\nGet here close as they possibly can to election day have America or have to stand up for itself and then they'll use it against the president saying this is the Republican Party this is how inhumane they are they're going to support the children they are going to support the mothers they're going to exploit anybody they possibly can export\nThey're going to do what ever they can to support them so they can use their hardships for their own political reasons\nLet's go to your phone calls on this see what you think about it one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to uh let me go to George thinks are wedding you're on the bench Ferguson show go ahead\n[noise] yes first thing I like to say is that President Trump is doing the right thing\nI Am the place and that came over in the Nineteen fifties from New York and they should stop all of this immigration nonsense and go back to the a plan they had in the fifties you had to have a sponsor first of all\nAnd that sponsor usually gave you a job for you to when they will be on your own in the country and get another job this thing is\nIf something when Wallace you sponsor responsible for you in other words that was no such thing is going on welfare and that's one of the big problems here\nAnd what happens is if the sponsor didn't want to do anything you went back to the ... you came from and that's the way it should be\nSee I I agree with you because it used to be accountability there now it's well I don't want to have to deal with any of the accountability the government or the the Democratic Party has in essence become the sponsor\nThat's correct and and and so they say there is no there is no one to show you the ropes there's no one to get you connect to the community there is no one there to hold you accountable to work to your tail off\nThere's no one there for any of that because now it's just getting this country will give you a free health care will give your kids free schooling we'll give you everything you want for free\nYeah it's all political and it just basically getting bogus could've done with that that's the only thing they have left everything else\nIs a failure you look at any city the Democrats have a tip your sticks to eat it and you can follow that city bankruptcy\nPeople are moving out of those places and into places that have a better tax rules I mean this is a big big problem and if you used to avoid any regime that is correct word to use here\nOkay because they were in the past ... you know this goes back to Alaska gene uh they were advertising\nFull page ads in Hong cities to South America and they make cities and basically telling all the ... things that the United states had cause them to get it in the\nShallow any taxpayer out that she is this what they do they get the whole thing should be on the tax payers broaden that had jobs here and the distribution ... distribution of Monday she'll be up to the governments\nWho was who was your sponsor when you when you came through I mean it was in a family friend out of that work\nThis was the Catholic Church\nAnd they ended they do more than just sponsored a mentor you did they get you connect in the community what all did they do\nYeah they uh they did that and they provided a depression job and you had to work there for about a year to two years and then if you had something better going ah you know job why are you going to get that job\nIt was it's a simple system but it's the you know it's up to you you don't want to crush peoples and ... and that's when they come here and the only ambition that most of those people have is to go on welfare that's the only Sumpter yeah at me as a human being\nAnd as you just put it don't go on welfare don't have a backup plan amen to that great point and I appreciate the phone call will continue this conversation right now on Facebook and on Twitter ... Ferguson show on Twitter you can follow me there and Twitter and hit\nLike button on Facebook will continue the conversation there right now in the meantime have a fabulous week\nTo make sure you can follow us on Twitter Ben Ferguson show altogether on Facebook as well\nBen Ferguson show hit the like button\nHave a fabulous week [noise]\nSo we're twenty first day on the breed or radioactive high check out our talk radio resist the Rio de brand new episode with the legendary Paul McCartney\nNo arming treat to molded film with Joel leaving to talking about his new album Egypt Station in of course some discussion about a little band called the Beatles we were ... when we were playing music or radio presented Rubio check it I'll know\nWhy Tracy Esther was low\nFive Ninety Jaycee a street are gone and on your own with our high orange radio I never sang\nHe's talked to scientists don't long so overwhelming I really hope she doesn't really know what I'm saying\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying that indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria a bird to Romo that Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThere was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through Perkins Coolio law from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton the paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we are finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's is with us\nFormer congressman now on Fox News contributor author of the New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nThey seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or maybe I can issue a subpoena but the only way to force that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the OJ won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also militarized themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ...\nHe was canceled for the DNC he was counsel for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... a productive group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they could just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up\nAnd do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope Jason you're talking to your former friends and telling them to get them or get in to the Congress to take this it and I don't care if they're not going to\nUm ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it\nYou've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene in usa peanuts and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it there is that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the Pfizer warrants the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nAh Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael with us Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom\nBetween the Congress has an important issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a two to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information\nWas fat conversations George Papadopoulos\nWere intercepted and then the court intercepting those compensation they found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information to the by the court\nKnow it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said this\nSame thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there's no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump\nCollusion but they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin\nI is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relief of his duties but just before Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath\nBut I still had to

Q. it's law enforcement it's veterans are\nThe candidates said and then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those who are told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented\nSo I guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia that's going to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp telling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote in Georgia\nAnd said I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants and adding that it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in a gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Chris than a cinema now she's going up against Martha ... Sally one of the important races that were following\nAnd how she uh had referred to her own home state and people in our state of Arizona being crazy and the meth capital of the world and all the Washington Examiner apparently found emails that show cinema herself inviting a prominent group\nI'm not making this up of I'm reading from the Washington Examiner of feminist which is\nNow how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of the there's the side that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them were on a razors edge with the Iranians with their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I think Trump get one more thing I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly\nTried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were supposed to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah yeah that's the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just set it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they like the president on that you know the president came up to the king and ... among the crown prince that called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale\nAnd something that we don't know about it looks like they have like the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia\nAnd well okay you're going to happen I mean the the men and women I chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting in driving et cetera and being told how to dress or being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera I'm ...

I think you were sort of looks like a high school graduation of people have seen it on television probably or if you live in a major us the central feeding people dress up differently but it's such a

not I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you the answer which is a when I was an organizer you know before you and I met I was a community organizer I used to organize protests like you know going to people's workplaces or you know not just the halls of Congress right because that's\nWhere the people's business is supposedly done what we're talking people's lawns cetera\nUm you know look I support in a free speech absolutist I support free speech on all sides so am I and the and then these protests those sorts of protests now make me uncomfortable and look I did speak out against\nA you know going up to you know and it's costing people in restaurants or you know what happened to Sarah Huckabee Sanders et cetera\nI Do think you are\nI I Love you say you're dancing 'cause you're kind of ignoring you know I I don't know what I'd like to punch I'd like to punch him in the face or not the crap out of them or you know maybe they should have been rough up or you know that that if we talk about\nViolent rhetoric and we're gonna look I think it's all bad but like ... rhetoric\nIs now the tactic I the the heart\nOf the hard left you know people don't like when when the president says you know fake news and they're not real news people and their phony journal is I think that's just that's the exercise of free speech and my hearing you write you used to organize protests in front of people's houses\nYou didn't hear me correct yes\nWhy would you do that knowing that there could be kids women and children in the house because I kind of a rule leave the women and children alone\nWell I I I haven't\nMet maybe maybe it'll today that I don't know maybe it'll be accused of being\nSome of those policymakers might be women so leave the husbands children alone to where the partners whatever again I'm not saying it a as a some kind of bragging rights I'm saying it because my position on that has changed\nBut we'll hire hearing now regularly issued these sound to me like marching orders creator crowd push back followed them into gas stations department stores restaurants you see a cabinet member you go at him getting their face\nI'm not hearing the Republican side and my point to you is this look I I think it's very hard to try I I ... I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line and um I got to be\nHonest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all but I think we've gotten to the point where we're going to have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now ... get to walk the halls\nWithout what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations zone in that are\nIn protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and find a way all within the last ... to\nDo it but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is his rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pulled by play it for you right now\nI always said about Obama the number one leaves kids alone that both he and Michelle

about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren\nHas claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania all teach you got all the law school\nShe was described as quote the only in your minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her ...\nThey are and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against\nAs a result of all this then tries to prove to her detractors\nThat she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but\nYou know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld than Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible Jeff that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nIn showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm and you know Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the un Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist friends at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House in ... when you're twenty\nI'm In no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever on\nIs a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nTake your kids to cover today\nGo to ensure kids now dot Gov or call one eight seven seven kids now [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nGo go\nReally shutting down a woman or online services something called ... plus [noise]\nAfter they found a software glitch that exposed private profile data of nearly half a million users to outside for developers this all happened last week Google\n\nThey ...

C. S. J. lo and I are radios\nAt ... dot com on your own with our high orange radio ads\nIn numbers how many ... that appears to be part of the strategy for a caravan of migrants that started in Central America now an estimated seven thousand heading for the U.S border where they're willing to take their chances spite us efforts to stem the flow\nAnd then you've got a case an allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements in his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen\nApparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I\nThey should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you that\nIf you want to predict and it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida he'll do a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida as important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe it's not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with uh we've got infinite whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know run the center of the great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nGillum is we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views he's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBeing honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe and what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett us it and the project ... tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but you know for whatever reason bread I said is out there trying to convince the people tend to see that it's something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and\nSaying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill you know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets hoops to Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable but some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been\nCut the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the week in front of some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening LA Weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep you keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or hired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled\nAmericans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have ... I didn't get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber\nIt's a far cry from last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha ... alley is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations of new Fox\nA poll has come out of Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about ... the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about the diction submitted fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom for as it was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nToday that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi\nWas her eyes on the speakers gap said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black um ... Marshall mixed Martha McSally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and a high camp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly a problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian race\nAnd that means that the libertarian is siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong\nWell Mike Braun is now claiming that\nYou know a Brett Kavanaugh served citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this and add to all of this this was an opportunity one bit of anecdotal as we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats as at an all time high but you know I'm Crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on friday and an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people a hundred and thirty\nThe president of turkey says he's going into detail tomorrow in his speech before parliament about the details surrounding the death of Saudi journalist ...

footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants\nYou know by a chain link fence said the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling the fence others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap in the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross into Mexico\nNow this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I've been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times I have seen it it's wide open\nWhat are we gonna what's gonna happen and we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping the caravan ... make their way to our southern border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally it is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty\nThey're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies that allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there well you know it just I mean it's basically a national emergency\nIf you look at it you have a Spanish language reporter who spent weeks imbedded with the migrant

it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nA said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly\nUm so you've got the care of and continuing their march\nNow a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and there is a political thing\nHaving been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego\nHelicopter horseback boats all terrain vehicles you foot I've been out there I've seen even gang

National Guard in order to make sure\nThat we saw what happened last friday in Mexico but their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now a ... it's almost like we're headed towards a major\nHuman confrontation here people that don't affect our laws in sovereignty and the president saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty um no I I think Democrats are like ... in the back of their heads hoping this happens so oh maybe something bad will happen in Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you you never know I Hope I Hope not I pray not yeah\nSame here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady comment is that a Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said I'm In I'm sick of this kind of stuff she gives it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted a toy store her goals and dreams in this great nation\nThat's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happened and the and the possible political implications\nAnd motivations behind these things that's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come this to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming asylum aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem and we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to confront either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nOr we saw Mitch McConnell go through this at the airport and then this weekend and happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now hearing Kissinger was shouted down listen to some of this [laughter]\n\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nI got a Ninety two year old man who served as countries you know it's unbelievable you know what the ... you know ... or what's the name Maxine Waters you you create a crowd you confront them you do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell Leo country\nYou know then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil with somebody you disagree with\nNo this is this is as wrong as it gets this is not how not on a decent people are supposed to behave and and it is you know with the part that bothers me the most Sean is did is to send it is a good friend of mine and he is as far left as I Am\nNow is actually a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the ideas he'll show up and have a robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he would never this is the new left\nThis isn't new to this is the way liberal and and and people who believe in their positions and their ideas and their their policy that's the way it's supposed to be but what is happening now is so dangerous for this country and so so wrong and just\nNot going to let me ask you this and this great nation off or\nHow does the president and this would be my goal the president obviously is is going to pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing it has this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to anyone to get hurt at the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know we're getting we're we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that mixed in with the crowd to want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life\n... if they're hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safest for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't want to see people the president does want to see that\nBut on the other hand I Can't you can't allow them to come in either\nI write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced the Democrats once a quarter because I think deep down they want the politics of this issue they don't want to solve the problem we need more judges on the border we need more ability to when people get there to hold them not this catch and release policy hold them\nHow they're have their case that due to cater to we can find out or they legitimate or they're really fleeing something or or are they coming here to do harm are they part of the same game what's their background each it takes some time to do that but and it takes resources it takes\nPresident Trump tweeted the Democrats are to blame for the care of and for the lax immigration laws he's vowed to stop them from entering the wives and a massive search is still underway for the Wisconsin missing teen who disappeared after her parents were found dead in their home there in

living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans that won the presidency you know those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated ...\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so ... what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter insect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors Asian the caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that did very well credential judge\nOh he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do when I'll tell you the CBs carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blamed the Democrats\nWere not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary built Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your border because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get\nA you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response so\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... what could the rancher possibly\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ... percent of the society shutting the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last ... Eighteen months that is a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons was either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get it and he called them the blue collar billionaire and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put it in President he was at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that has not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better when in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspirations\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is it you cannot just ties\nOr through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nKnow the real danger so I don't know how this was all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a ...\nBut figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives it's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is\nOr living

thought in the past to ask for these things and the fact that he not only does it then wins then the American workers all across the country doing better and that that's what brings us to this

was able to\nPressure on China from Europe he's affective Lee and people are really reporting is pretty joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also have these trade issues and these trade agreements with China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them\nBut they're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show hopefully owned by me back I think he gets a trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe ... let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened there economy took a thirty five percent dive\nSo that would tell me right now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're banging on his door begging that they can get those back\nOf course yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent it to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and uh we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs you're\nJust to break even shot and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled or it'll be cataclysmic for that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end of November but I bet you they get it done shortly thereafter\nOr because we both know the president's personality he's hitting very very core of but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness with the Chinese government are and what is best for the American working family so\nAh and that's why he's doing so well ... and by the way you know back its

senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri or their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like a Washington Post he's pleading at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about some of these position I said what about other things she came here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed is something that I've been pointing out for a while we Maxine Waters on\nTape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five then we see\nThe center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now uh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's eh thing beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appealed to moderate through the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri are kind of see you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when the Democratic party a band in\nAny sense of due process under the law equal application under our

most disgusting thing to me it's the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it isn't backfiring on her and I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to do is come out and apologized to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not proud of and I'm not going to run\n\nHi I'm Geoff Diehl running to be your

by the way twenty five now told the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren well she does have to get re elected a senator if she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is Native American\nWe can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage she was featured in a Native American cookbook that isn't titled\nHow wild chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American in a professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but\nYou know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nA show and great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm stuck around one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the models were they on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when it's not tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republicans for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist printed that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about the safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House",

and and and restaurants and you tell them we don't want to know where ... ... ... now where any point any time I mean is that the New America because I didn't I don't remember that um [noise]\nWell that's certainly the America will desperate left because they're losing or the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new lipstick violence a which in the end I think\nTurns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because this is Steve ... proved when he was shot um you know if you're conservative when you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watched the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes\nAbout running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of the conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it\nWasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract and I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I it everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not they're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is the fourth a cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing of America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and is often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments are and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater or fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and his ... and I think that just further isolate some\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna\nTeach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done um they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and it's partly because\nIf they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned this on your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind our cabin all and Carol van I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination the childish behavior by US Senators incentive meetings\nI think all that came together to really really galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan\nComing up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks because it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody\nWho can get finance and remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala actually four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among and us border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just as it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump's manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams or who are clearly favors

left and they send cameras following him for ten minutes\nThough I ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then then you have to ruptured and said that was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name\nUm but then he got on and he went on this had been a tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the

only twelve days until the important mid term elections\nYou know it had been and even I and phone into this even though I tell you don't fall into this I had been reading the polls and I kept seeing a mansion is up by ten I don't see the seat and play and\nObviously an election year conversion he votes for Kavanaugh which was a good bowl with the right thing to do um but with that and I'm now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir a congratulations this seems to be a very big comeback\nI'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell ... thanks so much for having me on and I think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter flop advance the Trump jobs agenda\nAnd matches or dishonest Washington liberal more and more people drill down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very do it and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worries during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business\nYou know it's one of our our best resources that we have clean coal and we have you know people brave enough to go in the mines I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's about energy in the life a lot of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened and Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years during the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the offer ... took the lead nationally to go against you know I'm a power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal\nOn the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are basically your health services rage that President Trump's\nReally strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate that so that's one of the president's comments were strongly behind me she knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today are meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nAnd I have a compassionate solution\nTo ensure the safety of Democrats the best thing you can do is to simply vote them out of office so they won't be in a position that anger is so many people and remove them from daily public political circumstance in threat once again I condemn all bombs in politics today well known Democrats or the ...\nWe must protect them vote them out of office for their own good and their own safety that

glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you\nA good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and uh uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of take the lead now but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal or replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf if we in two weeks to have a ... a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold onto the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races than the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have by the way preexisting conditions the big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about\nBeen able to get Dr Josh ... outlets Seventy in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals or even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks or treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge care you ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals\nAnd if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario and it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been a vacation\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nBut we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website Hannity dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida we're a little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on in Nevada\nUh we definitely need more than ... Sally war hero against this radical Christ in ... now no problems with Americans joining\nGee how to use and and joining the Taliban then of course we've got Montana tests or has a lead at this point but that's still in play a Heidi Heitkamp is down by double digits\nA and Joe Donnelly his case he should be removed\nAnd we've got a good candidate brought against him but people can't waste their

they all had powder and them some type of electric some type of electrical connection device director re described it here's a little bit of what he had to say\n\nIn that effort and getting those

[noise]\nSo we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices [noise]\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the guy left\nBased on their

Americans like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from\nIraq to re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day you know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through the time it was far worse than was reported\nAnd uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nAnd I said that\nAnd just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and is it do they came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said\nMr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I said this only because um\nThere's this idiot\nOn fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Avalon somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part but when he ... basically blaming me listen to this\nRestaurant had and he says had a direct language may we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage in big echo an amplified by Fox News and other folks and the conservative jets yeah but the nearest not like the others\nRight why Robert De Niro well one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and when she said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden it becomes ... a Robert Deniro I was calling the president devil and us devil worshippers in effect you know\nA piece of playing the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the tissue to see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ...\nMe because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's ... he's a dog he's a pig he's a\nCon artist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his

our president De Niro saying that he wants to punch the president in the face that they do any research over there you know over a fake news CNN any at all you see a\nPattern between the president's attacks on Twitter and and stage being echoed an amplified by Fox News why Robert Deniro Sean Hannity October fifteenth that old segment blasting deniro\nOh so that's why he got a package from this

attempt to exploit and\nPoliticize the actions of one unhinged lunatic and conflated with fair and wanted criticism and that for them is they're putting politics above all else and that's wrong for

I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLittle like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats flows he become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they picked up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nIt's a split decision except that the Democrats will have a focus they will control the house think of the committees that are going to change [noise] think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the\nWith the with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes they're legal this stuff and he'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know\nUs pollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election all you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same marry you said it's getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing they\nBarely even when they are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nYeah I Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare and I think he is right to say that\nThe Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret\nIt's not so much from Trump that is at risk if the Republicans in the house and Senate were much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt the ... one of the weaknesses as it relates also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty by a separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and the dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands that they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered\nDelivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety four and September that have we have the generic Republicans up seven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour\nBorrowed ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some say the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh uh Democrats their National Committee to the one the ... that money needs to find his way into the into\nThese top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats\nAre outspending us virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races weather's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop below sea\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats\nAnd uh uh ... they really they really are focused in on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell they're shot a power but remember you know those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state in I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans won in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there and we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be\nBasically two more years like we've had in that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think both are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats win the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... ... good luck for two years\nI make a slightly different on a book on the way to look for um a dumb I Know John is certainly knew Shaun I just hope we stop demonizing doing what Maxine Waters it and say\nPrompts responsible for you know

lost their everything they've lost their entire home they'd been relocated and they don't have a chance to change their voter registration probably so that means that have to go back to where they

of the American people more prosperous that will create more opportunity that will make us more secure\nEverything you get is predictable Democratic Party one oh one mere slander ... blood joining whoever they don't like and don't agree with it you know the new it is there one and only play book\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program but the stakes couldn't be higher\nFor weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman\nJerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better or they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else did they stay on for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago if the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation east kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because it hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt built today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall you know record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years\nLast time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes Hispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for our veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nResidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea\nThe sanctions in Iran are now paying off we see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards\nTo that President has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's\nVast wilderness and we just let it sit there and we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from many selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd in twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they're going to now say you know what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know it was just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pit and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in may\nOf twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview her Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would follow the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney remember the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait\nWhich is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that they went out and hire the former and my six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and in in Iraq at Torrey and Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling\nThe number two the the lead counsel for the FBI who is now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside and anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's studying in terms of what it reveals since it directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI official sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was a cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in fact you know its application then for the price of warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe fights application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nWhich by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials that the D. OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes as she was on with Maria ... I think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice for doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the price of warrant to snoop on Trump campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the size of warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without a Hillary's involvement here\nThey wouldn't have been a ... an application to spy on the Trump campaign that wouldn't be fusion GPS or die ca on Trump\nTape Trump anyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThe thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source\nClose to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously because he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nYou

Hannity show\nTwenty five 'til the top of the hour scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land that a category three a and there's a massive storm surge risk the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined\nFort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I say I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane\n... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf but a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area\nNow the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the of sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast\nThis one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a place that strong category where he perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look to the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nAnd it's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October of ...\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the typhoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and he said well what is it has to do with us well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to Tampa oh or whatever I can say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got so last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto we hit it off to the east over there with sports this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest it's heading\nIt's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas\nYou're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't hit the ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks in forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves up it's going to accelerate through there\nWhere we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City that is ground zero for the worst part of this storm\nNow also locking down it's all good for the American people\nI don't know why people you know there are different people different styles and life like lenders very combative and drops the F bomb a lot\nOn this because not doesn't do it on the program because we have a dump

Rosenstein conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least to the spin was well I was just say that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah quarter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker\nHe was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... cave and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAny way now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain and the FBI lawyer that\nWas assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was the real plan being discussed that the source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI remember then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special

three weeks Haley federal working with Trump was a blessing adding the world has a different view of the U.S now\nThe United states [laughter] countries may not my favorite\nThing if we say we're

signed the fourth and final of Pfizer warrant\nIn other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associates\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI ideal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek alert secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the hoped she'd say something that they could use and then and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and are they saying that Baker is that it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWhen he was a pretty stunning revelation and since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department and the FBI officials have said in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firms Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funnel money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything bought and then they hired fusion GPS in our research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the dossier same dossier that was never corroborated verify but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a Pfizer warrant to spy on the Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a Perkins cool either lawyers have guy by the name of Michael ... Smith directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to bake or documents\nAbout Russia's attempts that meddling in the twenty sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer Warren wiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding in applying the poor Pfizer warrants\nAnd permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and write Jared continue with us anything I'm saying here that is wrong right Garrett\nYou've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele to compose is totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch any investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Osmond or who is passing along\nComputer storage Dana as well is documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Rochelle\nConnection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research

insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really a ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a bone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or it's an emergency you know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's\nHow you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care bound Asian you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in ... with able to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice any health are pushing me was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create a ... tour you know and we're ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of liberty and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about about health insurance we're using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for service because they just are helping shots\nWondering ensuring if using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized and your co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so you know I'm pleased to see the the you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think that you're real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this exact topic\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shocked\nTo gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody he whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and\nThat gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay for every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month\nSo and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household ah the the real ... and the the politician their heads and California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nSo you what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get much cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you actually looking at ways that are fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a book you know as far as the cost of care is you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we we can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well above a care made that illegal\nOr so something ... just brought up to ... get access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually crew insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses there's Seventy five dollars a month or\nTwo but what it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition or ... or do you deny them service\nThat everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over and not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by them\nAnd how did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nHer imaging everything will hire people or ... thousand dollars low yeah so that's a Ninety thousand dollar saving\n... at a hundred thousand dollars a conversational she's going to die of cancer\nAt ten thousand dollar a couple of dollars that go to the church raise raise money in a big sale\nOh and you know considering that most people are out of pocket expenses now for health insurance plans to let them thousand dollars per year what do we ensuring when the once in a lifetime catastrophic won't can be treated mature for less than ten dollars bingo\nUnbelievable well look I Hope everybody will pay attention because in twenty eight days Americans are going to go to the polls in Obamacare won't work and we know the left and the Democrats want to keep it in\nA I applaud you guys for what you're doing and the fact that you've been able to duplicate the model around the country speaks volumes about what your real mission is and that is saving people's lives and it's very inspiring thank

they're doing\nNow the moms in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe\nBombs that had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nUm how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive putting his mailbox and I listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday\nLike they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list or George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop\nThis is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on almost I you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the holes you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces bidding and Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue because it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\n... they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bang on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the seat where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and in other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out these incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second you know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist\nOh does that mean that is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies oh the the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt\nI don't want anybody hurt\nDon't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nYou know it ought not be prices precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can\nSo we had a pipe bomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George tourists his home in Westchester New York suspicious package center Debbie Wasserman Schultz was officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office you\nKnow with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder tech them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant in department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are\nUm you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences\nOf security in my life you know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax\nThat was sent I don't get packages anymore and my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that was it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's dawn wall to wall with reports suspicious packages and you\nKnow that was sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder's another one and\nYou know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump's\nDefense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin in ... the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people I I never saw such heroism\nIt was amazing but you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing in the buildup to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nThis isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that skull leases shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say I blame burning I just I did the opposite\nI don't know I eat can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters you're not responsible for that but the media today and their their reaction to\nThis is so over the top so outrageous so disgusting Lee partisan it just it they're so quick to blame President Trump Fox\nWe had rice and sent to Trump mad as re Haspel\nI don't remember any coverage now in the case of any of this there were lunatics I'm going to prove that we get back that I'd been consistent and I'm also going to prove what you're hearing today from liberal politicians about civility is they're just words because their silence\nIn the last month over the most serious issues or their supporters has been definitely will get to that end or Thirteen

though Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every

like you know\nThe amazing this is now number three reticent a phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you\nA showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states the elected what's\nSo amazing is that consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they can basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people tendency ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same user and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bottle of like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well\nBecause the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff the same so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters and play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but she's going to be selling liberal once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again\nSo because this what Jesse over and says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people in their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that our party has pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that if we do it very costly confirms suspicions and we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and nearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to move the moderates and that and they can only make one choice\nOnce but if you're not a good choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn Web day so\nIt's so hateful showing that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody and his staff but McCaskill asked to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it's in harm's way back to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're east Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but\nThirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something all Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nWill spare no resources are expense in this effort and I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify\nAt the White House today Trump called the actions despicable he said there's no place for any kind of political violence in the U.S Trump's that investigators

I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's a ... gauge whether Trump voters a short you know you're done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited billions and their voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing\nLast Thursday a those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nThey got to see the the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats had looked at ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart strategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at the map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours\nEntering states that that Donald Trump won\nWhat can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabin or that the Republicans pull him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay on because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man and his family and the Republicans are ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was a poll that we did for super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day\nIt's it's not a big explosion but what it is is ... ... is coming back in\nAnd get along well ... ... that Trump voters were dying well what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they are being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nShot I mean I don't quite know how to fly but al ...\nAnd you can say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is an ongoing leaving the house which right there you can lead to pick up the house and I think\nFrom what I see looking at the Senate races they're all very very close within the margin of her\nAnd I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect narrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than\nYou are talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with my writing of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenges the one John raises I think it's that's right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs going on inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... in sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where we\nDon't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did to this man for support\nAnd disgusting and I don't believe who live poor experimenting Arlen than things\nThat you know what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they've been with no due process and for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness\nThe topic deserved they handled it properly they looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration\nNow do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not\nIt's too early on the house and and prior to cabinet looked like we're going to lose the house but uh uh with that kind of a negative on policy\nFor her to be the leader to oppose Donald Trump every day for the next two years to his reelection he needs to take her on every day about them wanting to raise taxes on the economy have open borders I've been having a back to the elites where the swap around the country again\nSo uh if he does that over the next four weeks the

us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation\nOr the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that has created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just will humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that each challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you

does it go John McLaughlin\nQuality that I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you notice the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done our regulations to visit with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again and that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened\nWith the backlash of about the whole having a hearing in how unfair it was and you can see we had to pull this this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down write and write and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the ... the energy sector is so important to the state\nThat you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want chops and what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is do you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down and you weren't philosophy to raise taxes take what you got and take away the jobs take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfavorable among all voters she has a she has the fifty three percent unfavorable among independent women\nThat the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nSo these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats\nThey're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where you know the smart money on Wall street saying hold it if she's if she's going to be speaker and they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country does\nShown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house\nBut I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it and they want to get rid of ice they won't fund a border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who\nThought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of a New York\nI have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing state even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that I Know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat problem it's not me and it stems cells are streaming shows or write to\nMe it was it that are closer to the extreme conservative no place in the state of scenarios that it's not because it's\nSimple no one has tons within a rifle no one can\nUh I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything and you love and vote for once me out of town\nSo am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity and New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for it I think my friend John and I can\nSee a Johnny Williams will you disabuse our friend Doug of any notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still in hand with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of the state we send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no\nNo income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it does hold an ad on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg ... I heard it oh yeah yes\nI don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him 'cause he's moving so far left\n... it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash but but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as John says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got it's\nHe could run out whether\nOr not you know like you're ... you're not the way by the way we're checking out your high school yearbook\nRight now I have never looked at it I Know for a good idea what's in there and my God\nI Know what you're not exactly run up to the Supreme Court but if if you check out\nLike that but I looked at the half of my junior my junior senior year I was tending bar till four thirty in the morning a lotta night than\nYou know I was just I didn't show up half the time so that's probably a good thing people don't even recognize that I went there with lots of witnesses yeah I'm sure there as well we'll dig 'em up somewhere from forty years ago uh All right John McLaughlin and a dog show and thank you both for being with us [noise]\n\n\nNBC News radio I'm Tom Robertson hurricane Michael's devastation is now being linked to at least Thirteen debts and that number is expected to arrive today we learn to for victims being killed in storm related incidents in Gadsden County Florida Florida governor Rick Scott said this at the scene of Wednesday's landfall Mexico beach on Florida's panhandle\nWe had more storm surge probably hear the norm\nWe can probably twice as much rain but this was\nMore than a million people remain without power due to the one time category for hurricane and the swap from Florida to Virginia there's apparently proof that Washington Post columnist Jamal could show was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey NBC cheap foreign correspondent Richard Engel\nWashington Post says that the Turkish government that the Turkish security agencies have\nRecordings audio and video recordings showing that your mouth and she'll be this\nJournalist who's been missing for over we walked into this building never seen lean to to leave and the recording that once he was in thought he was murdered interrogated and\nMissouri State University students says she was raped in her dorm room just hours after attending a meat to rally the twenty two year old victim at her alleged attacker met Saturday after attending the rally\nA white Michigan man who shot out of black teens who had knocked on his door to ask for directions is guilty of assault within tend to do great bodily harm Jeffrey Ziegler fired at fourteen year old Brennan Walker this past April during closing arguments today the prosecutor told the jury the evidence backs up the charges\nWere killed\n... whole thing that George ...

the kids would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump but if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passion\nAbout ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country and\nThe more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf

demeaned the confirmation process\nYeah we we can't be civil of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil you gotta be kidding when you when they go low you just kick 'em\nWell Michelle Obama said fear is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think of\nHow you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want him to be afraid to their neighbors and you want the main greedy one dimensional wondering Michelle Obama say anything when Sarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a

gain a couple seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker\nAnd Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff has a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman Elijah Cummings the chairman and it's endless investigations\nInto one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even when I warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides your nose Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children pro granny over the cliff\nJust one you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country is pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend\nAnd not even tell the people there viewers that while the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel and the same people you\nKnow what I'm saying Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about pose a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm going to tell you to just ignore the polls at this point does it matter you still have a job to do and if you want to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit poll showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin and he won both of them\nAnd the media nobody's there weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in and about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and and I told them the story about two thousand and four with the media again the polls came back\nAnd George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still have time to vote because he read the same information that I just read a John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls were they'd been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house I Am painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have the majority\nOf ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nGet to decide how you're going to feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to the next president Frank Luntz who's reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data\nI had read the same data so if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election remember Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms of media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty forty Republicans are going to pay huge price when\nThe twenty fourteen midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine feet Senate landslide\nHow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen\nA little tip the balance of power districts they're the most important but every seat is important\nAnd when you vote no that if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for ...\nIf you vote for a Republican if you're you're voting to keep the status quo of economic growth and prosperity and a strong national defense and build a border wall you know if you both for any democratic senator you're just voting for Schumer it'd be a vote for reticent McCaskill Nelson\n... uh Joe Donnelly cinema you vote for any of the pastor you're voting for Schumer [noise]\n\n[noise]\nNBC News radio I'm

go to the U.S Senate that too is that a tight race let's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved well\nThis guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that Senate legal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in so happy and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby it's buddy of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't interested isn't that buying influence in corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's gonna happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York junk get paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAnswered and pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaigned on twenty sixteen that was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you can't report after the fact that just basically cover new tracks CYA so it'll be interesting to report\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and in in a response to subpoena a one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so\nForty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation but Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it snow out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew get one picked this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders which is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement\nTargeting Israel they actually say Israel the genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters\nTo this day opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and when a Israel fought back against the mop attacked in may a Gillum blamed Israelis do they just use those attacks\nAs a pre tax it'd be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is really ... organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida ah they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be funded they pay they say the U.S is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their word with socialists principles that are so radical make Nicolas Maduro wash\nSo he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support or this radical manifest there so that's just who he is he believes in what they're doing is endorsed them personally and it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June and saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender\nActivists during\nA thirty days sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol referring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical groups\nQuestion I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you were running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor

in\nNorth Dakota now Kristin cinema who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban\nIn Arizona is the same thing is\nThat they're lying to their constituents they're running a propaganda campaign and they're acting like that they are purposely misleading the people of their states\nTo make them think moderates when they're anything but and they're all all the people working for them or in on the

says she can't be who she really is another staffer a snow are is her name Madison ... says quote cinemas going to stand up and protect Arizona value is whatever the after that means unquote so they're mocking the idea they're mocking the id staffers that Senate much ought to represent the state\nThat she's supposed to be the senator for that show that they're they're mocking at it that she should be be appealing to moderate people and representing the people of Arizona and they're doing so in this video\nAnd cinema has not responded attacking me and and obfuscating the fact that these folks work for her it's pretty pretty extraordinary shot and blowing up locally here as I speak\nWell it's bigger than they it's blown up locally in Tennessee Missouri North Dakota and now Arizona I'm I guess you know a gym sharp all was the head of the program did know a whole lot about the project and\nAnd but he's followed up on the story and apparently found that she lied to him directly which doesn't surprise me at all do you make any comment about that\nYou know it's interesting sharp is tweeting about it is what he said of course even if she does work for her that done it doesn't mean that Sam and knows her personally but and then sharp pleading the picture of Lawrence from this this worker for sending a standing with cinema in this picture\nAnd I've actually talked to I went to

existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant rate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lied to you about people losing their doctors that was a lie you like it Dr keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and\nThis is now becoming the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well where we're going to where we support health care pre existing conditions while the Republicans repeal replace planned supported preexisting conditions and they're trying to basically go with the narrow lie that Republicans want you to die\nRepublicans one dirty or water dirty air\nThey want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff of course they're racist or sexist massage

Kavanaugh's now the\nPresident's approval rating has an all time high at fifty percent today and the president laying out the facts in this particular case we've got an election in thirty three days and every poll is now showing that the Senate races in\nThe enthusiasm gap is heightened dramatically and significantly which is the right thing why because\nI think the American people are learning a lot that this is the Democratic party playbook\nIs a party that doesn't believe in due process or a presumption of innocence there's a party that regularly smears Flanders\nUses character assassination character blood Janine all in the process to gain their own power is not one agenda item that you can cite any Democrat that they're running on and thirty three days that's going to make the country a better place they don't seem to care at\nAll at what they've done with judge Kavanaugh\nOr when you look at the evidence and you look at the facts as the FBI did now they're attacking the FBI\nWhat do you find out is that there is zero corroboration to the claims of all three women in the ... not even including\nThe cases of outright lying that were dismissed early on about judge Kavanaugh\nThey just dismiss it altogether but none of this would ever make it into any court of law and there might actually end up being significant legal consequences to Julie sweat Nick and some

and her accusation we know in the case of ...

witnesses to the I Know and if I had to\nUse I mean every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of Mr Vermeer is the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that

and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI Know as a talking point what was on a second once you interview look in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the

when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else did the FBI to do that already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did as reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... the FBI just\nJust not that was can they

still is and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that he'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday it sounds sounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it's just you know I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a\nGood people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain and I feel like it's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he made was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had an absolutely not um and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know his own mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know they look at him and you'll find that funny Sean but we were actually related I think it for three\nOr four generations back our great great

no there is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like um I Hope it goes the right thing\nIf any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delayed they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would that not going to offer recommendations and they're not going to offer opinions here\nAnd all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh were to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it it is so it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not their falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating but the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and a media hysteria that that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with innuendo falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that that come out

it could hit Georgia as a hurricane\nA north easterly turned\nA it'll be a little south of Atlanta Atlanta is not going to get the brunt of this at some point tomorrow but Gus the is going to be hit really really hard so draw a line from Panama City Beach Florida straight to Augusta, Georgia\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect at that point it's probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and uh on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge these destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher\nOr over a million power outages we expect

in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina\nAnd uh you know you can make your preparation now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to

prayers are with everybody in harm's way today this is this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who said\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff are happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends and Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas they're going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn may have twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim Cole me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth buys a application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for\nPhony Russian ... that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal expense\nNow he was now\nAre supposed to testify but those three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person are all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse is over the terms of the testimony\nBecause lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aide said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying did he or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to find some warrants you know that as an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it\nThey knew the DNC paid for it they knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the the us da was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour and Great Britain and said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just saying things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump\nOr in ... when the Ritz Carlton well nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially of fights application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information you're presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said\nWell first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Wal Mart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that your people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in the history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks text confirmed that there's no there are there\nBut anyway then they start ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA they get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may\nIn twenty Seventeen and then they appoint rod a Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak\nTo the Senate or judiciary committee's outside of the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why Whitey especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath\nYou know and people worry about that just asked Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we'll going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days\nSo this is going to be a devastating hurricane

step that is what that means do I do I need to give out the numbers of Trey Gowdy his office and chairman Goodlatte office and say call these men and demand that they subpoena under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why there would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of called me the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell uh hopefully I I Would I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it you're listening nurse and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nOr to ... to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general must job in\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that are really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted Pfizer applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein side have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI had not a song we need to see that we need to see the notes that taken after every time it was or goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr or told us\nThat after each conversation he had with\nGlenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person at the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve of those\nSo the so called real too is when you see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include ... number so we we need all that information\nAnd again if you're ... find that we didn't you did talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see and more importantly the American people need to see\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero people I please too old to two to five six oh three oh a chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five\nFifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think with all

on the\nThe Dow dropped more than eight hundred points mainly fuel that rising interest rates and\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides just you know the the phobic foe before kind of stuff these identity politics and he's the Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president in the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work in the back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out\nAnd if people are motivated or like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote and the upcoming elections uses a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise] um and you know we just don't know that but\nYou're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation or ... that they built up and the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and uh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness they just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be and show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump\nTo maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy damned bonds you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host at a at a parasite at this point\nThey're the same thing they have ginned up this rage ... not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe's been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money and those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen\nWhen is enough enough you attack this if this American patriot and Kavanaugh you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for a the investigation and then teach men of Brett\nKavanaugh which Americans realize is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible or for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned especially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to\nA ruling the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than Brock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that\nUh which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why if it's not recorded or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does deceive\nAnd live with impunity without putting in self in legal jeopardy too what Rosenstein really watches oh you know Mr ... let's just you and I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein words ally as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement to Congress she's not looking at\nPerjury because he can always deny the conversations that good ... remembers the which which is why this is so critically important\nWell they've got to do that and they shot a subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put them under oath and these answers have to be given but\nUh I got to let you both so do the right great job Greg Jared congrats on the successor the Russia hoax ... new book is out right now it Spygate the attempt to

the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that obviously\nAll the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption\nOf innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump nominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nYour rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country\nAnd I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nOr tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted his son money years ago when he was eight and therefore he got as well from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance\nOf covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done with the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people that have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations\nJust going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already\nThat they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place\nShe mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind and no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and\nYou know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in you know that we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out Mr Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor\nI'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest\nAnd on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly that that particular event\nAnd the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drug ... almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties\nBut as he said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person to back up a story one of the names was dead and another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week\nPrior how does that become news\nAnd yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well\nWell they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um well he was in Brett Kavanaugh I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some collaboration\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nPolice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualify for someone who sent U.S Supreme court [noise]\nWe need and has the ins and because there\nA lot of allegations as far as really are about how he behaves finance truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration release late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel and ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath to last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the forward\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claim the Ford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment\n... look these are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day she said there were four people that could corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story most don't remember\nAny party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault\nSaid it didn't happen so at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent you don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement\nAnd assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nIf they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there's no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but by\nI mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and I got to believe and assume that they're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said at last week before the Senate Judiciary committee\nI'm just I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means because what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter\nLindsey Graham is saying Clintons sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I I think the the Republicans

you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening I think the president is set the stage now to pit\nAnd spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence and like you said America's coming back he didn't say we're back yet because we're not\nTo solve a lot of work to them but we're coming back and now we have a chance

they are trying to destroy Medicare\nThey're talking about destroying your health insurance they're talking about bankrupting the country\nAnd I think that we just have to go out and wage campaigning I must say President Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hardworking decent American\nHis disgusted by what they just saw happened to Kevin all his is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more

didn't pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney the way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid\nAnd I would say they have handled this what the appropriate

Collins and and flake or or Murkowski inflate once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri\nBecause if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero with the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean

with so many inconsistencies in all cases no corroboration not the case of professor poured not the case of Mr Ramirez and not the case with Julie sweating it\nKnow co-op corroboration Joe diGenova Victoria Toensing a with us the gentleman Toensing welcome both have you back to the program I'm Victoria and start with you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rape somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody I mean that's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's or the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers to help it you know how soon we all forget about these things but\nIt I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time and these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chains do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh committing some lurid sex acts is there no to corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made these statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that we\nHave now we examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and\nNow the last minute because they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidents in high school\nYeah well I think um what has to happen\nWith Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee and the confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate for her story there is no substantial issues permits Ramirez story and I just wanted to say something that I Know\nAre probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied them like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to your maybe Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise now remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist a resistor as a lawyer this is separate hats Deborah cats by the way who said well Paula\nJones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken\nBut I ... I saw a genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice of you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional rules\nI I'm a I'm a very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that\nI can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are\nFor safety now why is her story not include\nHer going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says occurred and if she had gone to those people\nWhat they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it\nShe had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know because we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think to the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats they just they just now push this so far\nInto a ... ... ... ... any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nI I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act to react I Would assume was probably\nPeople react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that he believed everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is\nNon existent there is nothing happened that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them there's\nAnother problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned them music up so nobody could hear her and then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what\nYou think these guys and it just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are so many flaws in what she does say\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next\nAnd then your calls coming up final half hour we'll just do all calls eight hundred nine four one Sean hey listen if you have sunspots

for that but you make a great point I mean you've got or NATO in story on the left side of the infield\nThat's those are gold glove ... potentially you know are not it was going to be ... D jays want to put Manny which had over there at second you know potentially you know that that's the thing it's there it's it's a monkey wrench into the in the cockpit I understand he's a great player\nBut then add him into a clubhouse Mike and you know how it works in in in particularly in baseball club houses\nUm there was a bond there and we really saw that a throughout this season as they went into the playoffs here how this a clubhouse was really clicking now it didn't translate in the national league divisional series but you bring in a high price sky that means you're telling somebody\nYou're not good enough well are you going to put it but no one spot you to put him in trouble spot you could put him in DJ spot or you're going to put him in your other high priced player and that's the end Desmond and make it play first\nAnd and I don't I don't know that you I mean if that's the case then go get a guy to play first base and and don't and don't pay as high a price on any Machado I again when you have no one story that moved just doesn't make any sense it's not as if you're looking to upgrade their\nRight I I absolutely agree with you and it and it frustrates and I understand fans looking at it and going well mainly Machado was out there we could have went out\nAnd gone and gotten him what could have gone out and gotten Christian or a yellow which\nAre at some point and and put him into the outfield as well but there is a plan for the Rockies and but black Saturday as we got into September even when things didn't go well\nUh when they played in that series against the Dodgers out their Chavez Ravine in the middle part of September of by the time they got back from Arizona they won those three in a row in the back have they said these are our guys we're not changing from this\nAnd they made a nice pushing got themselves to the end they'll DSL right back to the phone lines Gerard and castle rock kilo Gerard\nHey I'm doing great thanks good\nGood good eye you guys kinda stole my thunder a little bit before when I first called nobody had set it yet I was wondering about\nThe pitching is there the talent is there and you have these heavy hitters great that and yet you go to play off games that's Eighteen ending with out a run that's a problem when I mean these guys are electric I mean they've been killing it\nYou know is it mental I don't think you need to bring anybody I don't think I ... there there and like you said um most of the guys are going to come back next year so what do you do about ... ...\nI mean and one in Milwaukee and one game in court sealed so you can't say well the altitude I Can't say that two games to any without one run that's the problem\nI think that's fair Gerard and that's what I'm alluding to Corey and thanks for the call when I say the Rockies ... they look it's raw right now it might even be unfair to say it right now but this is what we're doing they have to take a hard look at that and say can we identify anything that could potentially prevent that in the future\nI I agree with you and we've talked about it on Rocky's reactive from time to time out or in the farm system you're trying to give the guys that are coming up through here we talk about the homegrown players are these guys have some championship experience or at least some playoff experience you\nKind of put them in elaborate situations or give them at bat in elaborate situations but there's nothing like playing in the in major league baseball and in the playoffs like this Mike I don't know if you can teach it but I agree with you I don't have an answer for it but I think they do have to take a hard look at it\nAnd maybe find themselves a bat but it it's not about that is going to help you throughout the season necessarily that's not what you're looking for you're looking for a veteran bat who can help you during the season\nBut then come through when you're playing those extra games in October we

the roster itself\nI really want to get like ... I think he's a great ballplayer\nHe's a quiet you know you're quite professional on and on will be you know this year we wouldn't have made it to the playoffs\nThe question of course are not on next year and what about\nThe thing about the way and that's even then I think about it the second all you have to leave so I think it's like the last or said why would you do it curl up in all the people want to give them a lot of psychological and baseball is very like a lot\nThanks Doug I think that last one is a good one from an average standpoint the Rockies as we talked about earlier didn't do great but what were they Corey second in the national league in runs scored but I mean it wasn't that crazy yeah the differential was\nWas something that people point to all year and I think those are all fair points to look at I Do think you have to remember that they one Ninety One game since ... through all of it\nThat matters yeah have you in the end and you know at this point up a couple of times like you could sort through all the stats that you want but the fact is like one Ninety One game that they made it to the national league championship series it ends\nDisappointing that it ends after three games sweep here but at the same time progress I Believe is being made but there are two weeks it will have to be made as well and I think identifying maybe a veteran right handed back coming in here maybe and maybe somebody else for the bull fan I echo what was said by the caller though\nYou know I used to have that I'm On a piano back into the mix of things you look great this year yeah no doubt Corey thank you much great work\nI appreciate it like last night for me but I get out of here and I just want to say this unfortunately it makes me sad we could have seen the last

class is bringing America to the brink of revolution\nAre we really getting to the brink of a revolution and in this sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where a party wins the White House power in the White House and they don't have losses in the next midterm election year the last time was right after nine eleven two thousand and one George Bush was president\nUm but I got to imagine people are pretty pissed off at the\nAt is what's you know it was two weeks ago yesterday and nobody had heard one bad thing about Brecht capital\nUntil two weeks ago yesterday and look where we argue they Tucker welcome to the show\nLike Sean well yeah I mean look\nCap now is being destroyed not because if anything he did or didn't do that because he's in the way\nOf the Democrats retaining power it's not personal it's just the party wants what he's about to get and so the crushing him and his family in order to get it\nAre we moving to a revolution while I don't know what the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division on us they're pushing racial division endlessly they're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not\nSoccer and that women should have men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them to control that divide and conquer it's my oldest strategy there it\nWell you don't look I I've I've chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans racist sexist I won't give the whole list but exactly they want to throw granny over the cliff and now with Supreme Court justices\nOr if they have an opening ... there seems to be no\n... there's nothing they will say or do now I mean you have friends of the attorney for professor kept you know Dianne Feinstein recommended who herself was pretty radical left\nNow soliciting people from the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is and asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people\nAnd the FBI now is being told by Democrats well it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement between a senator Coons ... that are of like last week\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so that they offer this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to debate the details of this or that taste one actually has nothing to do with the details with justice so this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Fort at my very first thought was the

investigation a number one first will work conservatives we have a moral up us if we if we do detect but there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use the power to investigate everything that's going on here\nAnd potentially witness was being coaxed ally people being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the public and we're going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think it look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd be asking ah what about Keith Ellison and why were they supportive of Bill Clinton

FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar so a throwing ISIS like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is this whole bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're great and then I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do a there your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nRight close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you end up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\nWell I think we've got the votes\nIn some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize the way he was treated\nAt the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man's been abused I'm not given up on him less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yes most Democrats will know no matter who Donald Trump s\nRide they've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question Martha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona up most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins\nUm we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race\nAnd do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\n... Ford's planes are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they wanting the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota\nWants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listed as viewers beyond that I\nDoubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive so I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but\nI think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook\nThat if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically\nWe would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist\nI don't care is like you know I'm a bad business I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with\nThe seriousness the charge deserves I think ...

in the county remembers that and we have we haven't heard from less friends so I'm asking you know are there people live in today I had a party so yeah there are people that know about that part I have\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweating it another of the French she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two and haven't turned back\nRight twenty five now totally a top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute how does this task for news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would things you can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... a systemic party culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here\nTo put this on the air Byron York\nIs joining us he's been running a lot of columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron\nHey Sean listen on this on this NBC thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds a war on on the basis of the lack of governance and uh there's no way to store if you ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad\nBut it was given in part a due to the news networks I'm hearing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that if you see as reported this is probably a good correct or at least we can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre just there just was nothing to this story um and when she offered a witnesses you could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nOn the other was deceased and didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gone to damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker well the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens of dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mrs Ramirez\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um\nNobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out correct so did you become a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here you know ... question I go ahead where we are\nThe things that he claims yeah from an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations\nNow they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today Vioxx published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking\nMischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr they

I think is a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her\nHer country with incredible honor and distinction and Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a recipe is simple that says\nThe latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nLet it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive the enthusiasm gap does is closed almost two dead even\nAnd hauled and you see Republicans and important Senate races now and dead heat in all of the states that are red states where where Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they ... they did everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process he may well have crippled his party for a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things they're called Republicans\nAnd there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats and he said to me\nI just don't think people are Americans\nAre going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we're living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict is with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever the vista nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now sunk to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor for there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nTo to look for anything parenthetically that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talk to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eyewitness said that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just got a jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's enough allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear\nCory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he's just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks about any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I found it painful\nUm he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you uh then the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created four million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling than war in the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe you don't even know their name is\nWhile he used for your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns\nAre actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and one of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the three sinks I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago\nCame back to the special one um and is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding\nIt isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote and if our side does show up in both\nI think this could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would

memos which could very directly bear upon this question of a war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually prove a I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting\nFor quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday and this week\nWe are going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier

tomorrow you getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere there there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan and a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president I'm\nHearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligent I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other intel\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted there was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm\nHappy to share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah but what we're pretty open guy but\nSo anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that who does have a network of of their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you're talking about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead\nAt the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a Rome people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington\nWho we're paying for these ah these operations in you know soon thereafter at that I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nEndless of first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ... I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ... that\nThey had the spies a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't ... I think\nFirst ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a Pfizer Warren on the Trump\nCampaign or were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean right interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they again because it's all\nAbout you know media perception what are they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication\nYou're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged right\n... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right right the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that that they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and then um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back I Know media organizations have pulled lies about you or I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard\nBut the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some records for you\nAs powerful as they are on the American people\nI I fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy no right so much in just undercover and\nYou know and even it it's funny over those ten plus hours of lab in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents you know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations they started saying\nWell our bosses and want to [laughter] you know they I think they saw through it but they knew you know that was back during the\n... Mehra as maybe one of the lessons never go visit Russia ever oh don't go to Vladimir Putin's Russia stay out well President Trump has done a lot\nTo fix that situation I think you know there's a his his courage I I'm inspired by that and I think there's even that is going to be fixed overtime I'm confident Carter\nPage thanks for being with us we always appreciate you being here eight hundred nine ... is our number thank you sir\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThe the news radio I'm I'm Robert attacks against now justice Brett Kavanaugh are being called false President Trump made the comments while speaking at a law enforcement convention this afternoon in Florida Trump says Kavanaugh should not have gone through what he went through\nWas a disgraceful situation brought about by people that are evils any tufted out we'll tufted out together\nKavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate Saturday and quickly sworn in a second swearing in ceremony will be held tonight at the White House\nThe registered owner of the liberal company that was involved in this weekend's deadly crash in upstate New York was reportedly an FBI informant twenty people died over the weekend when the limousine crashed after failing to stop at an intersection the limos operated by prestige limousine which is owned by shed Hussein\nFloridians are being urged to prepare for hurricane Michael Florida governor Rick Scott every family must be prepared\nRemember we can rebuild your how do we cannot rebuild your life take this seriously think either family Michael\nBecame a category one storm today it could reach Florida's panhandle or Big Bend area by Wednesday as a category three hurricane bringing with it a storm surge heavy rain and dangerous wins\nA drunk driving incident is causing a U.S marine commander base in Australia to be discharged police caught colonel James Schnell driving under the influence of alcohol he pleaded guilty today to driving with a blood alcohol content more than double the legal limit in Australia Chanel commanded more than Fifteen hundred troops\nFacebook users are being warned about another hoax that's making the rounds more from Lisa Carter\nElated since on teams are thinking their accounts and then click on what the message saying that some of the county's been making friend request to use to us and asked to forward the message to their friends to chain reaction is led to thousands of people receiving the pointless messages\nStocks are beginning a new week mixed on Wall street today at the closing bell the Dow Jones industrial average is up forty points you're listening to the latest from NBC News radio\nSensors showers often on around here throughout the day today fifty for a high thirty eight for a little cloudy and forty April Hi on Tuesday closer to sixty Wednesday and Thursday\nBeing on call Sam accountable to you every day ... is on\nA twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program\nOh All right let's get to our phones I Know a lot of what voters wanted away in a lot of news happening today twenty nine days till election day there is a lot at stake and I think the biggest case to be made is are you better off\nThan you are two years ago\nHave things in America change for the better do you want this party of slander the party of blood shunning\nPeople's characters do you want them rewarded because this is who they are this is what defines up the ... the not the party of due process that not the party of the presumption of innocence they're the party a bludgeon\nFirst and win at all costs that's what that's what's at stake I Know it's hard to get people motivated for mid term elections oh I Hope this wakes you up I Hope this motivate you I Hope you know the stakes are high I Hope you know there's a lot in play here\nNow we know Harry yet another institution I broke and and the ... the ...

J. last Thursday indicted a seven Russian hackers for hacking or any doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states as well as a bunch of places in Europe and I was wondering if you had any take on that because three of those guys were named Mueller's indictment\nSo I'm Wondering how it is they could have been doing I don't think there's any doubt that there is no\nDoubt at all that a\nLot of ... in the hospital regime of Russia be him being a hostile act or that he is that they are constantly trying to\nYou know create chaos in the United states and they're constantly sigh cyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something that very few people will tell you and that is at some point\nWe've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even some of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nAnd how much intellectual property is stolen that's billions and billions of dollars from Americans say ... you know if you look at Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known\nOh Julian Assange is what it is mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into NASA and the D O D that's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way the fact that\nWe have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we have and hire the best people to design the best systems to protect our intellectual property\nYou know at some point we can't blame others at some point we got to look inward and say ah maybe we're the ones responsible\nThat's what I'm thinking what do you think\nRight I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with with with this uh the OJ indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is to follow her\nCan't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the the OJ has very detailed information um I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty it's pretty\nKnow it didn't that its damning and you're right you know understand another thing is that not one of these people that mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody would have happened in twenty sixteen now every other studies have shown that it has an impact the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this\nOwner ability is at some point it

they investigate and nice throwing incident from Nineteen eighty four and I'm thinking if this is what it now has come down to because the three big cases they want investigated\nIn every case there's no ... at all\nNone and and multiple changes in stories\nAt least two of the three cases and yet this this goes on and the lander and the I mean I just described a story about what Julie sweat Nick was claiming and now she has backtracked\nI don't even know why NBC whatever run an interview like this but they did run it\nEven saying that well she gave U.S foreign names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is and the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she backtrack center story at what point does the man you know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously rate Donovan one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\n... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and are these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus have the audacity\nTo make all these charges in slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd have the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand up and defend himself\nAnd that his dealings with passion indicate\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair is righteous indignation his his to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the vents when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nOn its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand you digital camera I Would have to have that kind of\nInvestment

what is the proper response he's supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah Pete in\n... who were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're agreed you sleep wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different or individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some\nUh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry\nIs to ignore human emotion\nOver ... ... ... ... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat aspect he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him and he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he told himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially blade all she was credible\nThey they believe that a ... in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself it was a mashable report because I think it was thought that it\n... what ... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said was Dianne Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process\nAnd then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions you know I to me there's only one to answer the answer is thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida a from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens in the FBI's report if the investigation finds\nPlausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large but it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school\nAnd college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard and some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nDo you think of the interview which again the statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness\nOf drugging girls in gang raping them and now she while he was near the punch bowl and well he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and\nNobody else I mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time or we

for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished and we will have a vote on Capitol and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week we have any any timetable idea\nProbably don't know yet but uh I think that's correct as so here with the agreement or with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like risk but he was never part of this agreement\nWhat compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredibly\nAny credible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and said this changed anything I Hope we don't\nMove the goalposts Geoff oh did you sing committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to know the FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so are throwing I says like a good day in a bar so uh the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nOr the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize the way he was treated\nAt the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict at the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug he's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump\nMight be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states or were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats wouldn't know no matter who Donald Trump ...\nThey've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're wanting the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota\nWants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter]\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah though I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary the states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know\nIt's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive so I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but\nI think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can\nI find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nSaid if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding\nOf what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is that I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back\nTo to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\n[laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist\nI don't care is like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness\nThe charge deserves a them ... [noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made a gun and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Kevin\nThey have on them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative and you run for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist the point I'm massaging as the homophobic Xena phobias Lama fold you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children and it's going to be a look\nBut like if you're throwing a grandma over a cliff [laughter] it is as predictable as the day is long and now which Supreme Court nominees this lander has been taken to a whole new level do you have a night throwing incident when you were nine I mean it's ridiculous\nNBC News radio I'm I'm Robert\nThe New York times as President Trump earned a fortune by helping his family dodged taxes the paper claims Trump earn the equivalent of more than four hundred million dollars by setting up a sham corporation that helped hide gifts from his parents the times also says Trump helped his father make millions of dollars of improper tax deductions a Trump lawyer calls the allegations are false and defamatory\nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer is calling for the FBI to fully briefed the Senate at least twenty four hours before the vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a growing\nConsensus in the Senate that when the FBI investigation is complete the finding should be released publically\nWith any personal information rejected\nMeanwhile Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says Democrats practice the politics of personal destruction President Trump is praising the national economy we have\nThe best economy in our history\nStock market today just at another record high that's the hundred I think is one hundred and three times since I'm\nPresident that we've hit a new high speaking at an electrical contractors convention in Philadelphia today Trump also cited job growth and low unemployment\nRice in may have been male to the Pentagon the FBI is investigating after two pieces of mail reportedly tested positive for the potentially deadly substance CNN says the envelopes were quarantined after being flag that a separate screening facility\nPasadena, California police are looking for the person who fatally stabbed at twenty two year old man in the rose bowl parking lot lieutenant Jason ... says officers found Dimitri oh tap your junior with ... last night\nOr medics recalled the scene but as the paramedics arrived or the victim was pronounced dead on the scene standard protocol of investigations were followed and the area was cordoned off and witnesses were tend to be located\nPolice bleed tap you knew the suspect and they had been in a fight stocks were mixed on Wall street but the Dow was a hundred twenty three points to a day to a new all time high you're listening to the latest from NBC News radio [noise]\nCensor showers of other stores eighty five for a high ...

eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nUm so I I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah my attention was looking at the different levels you have a man named as one of them carry on state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nSkills or with the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things and some very very unsavory rooms were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll to having to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to go somewhere else more

money\nYeah so they just stay home I mean actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nUh how these things are involving right now because they're very a lot of very much here and there are I think people know no one should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and then they view about run out and voted\nDone and if you end up not election they do not do anything else go day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics than they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or were with the Republicans having the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did a forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nThe house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as a pretty frightening\nThought um where do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal range between the bottom of about two oh one\nWhich would mean below sea ... hiring them around to twenty thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up his speaking um and I can't I've been in all honesty you know I've always been standard though I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nKnow I Can't either I really can't I mean and I think and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and let them see below sea would win the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment and lives investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping

going to not voting affect a half a vote for him and she shouldn't be speaking um I think that's\nGood yeah I don't have to tell the people there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home\nOr you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you vote for reticent in Tennessee\n... you're you're voting for Schumer and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote\nThat's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nI just tell everybody we run into some of the claims or a moderate Democrat\nHands for the poor for a leader can say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house of of course and went on from that she was you know I sort of have to do that fine to treat them through a liberal because they have you on really kind of a moderate Democrats email I got to vote for him or defeat

eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when Orange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they have zero zero in on us\nThis is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California\nRaised as being that important but now it's become crucial in terms of in a we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com\nUm that they're really focused in in which means that could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm ... exactly yeah so\nTell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money in the negative ads\nYeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest employment in forty nine years as you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years\nPeople have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs consumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nTo where you had overregulation where you had high taxes where you had government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we have over ... fourteen point advantage on me after the the return over the Democrats\nSo we are seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump my big margins but the houses just harder to figure and\nI don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people in your\nState and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment or to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out and vote so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAh and the Democrats have thirty nine and sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around you're absolutely right

Penn and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there are outraged by it\nDry it and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American\nHeritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals proof of Native American ancestry again what proof\nAt this so backfired on her ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it because now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where\nYou can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah no no you turn to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and there was a group born by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I think keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project ... tape with Claire McCaskill in our own words also but now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks packs a punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were\nObtained a copy of it and Democrats in strategist to prepare the memos said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo a more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their ... to ... Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible when you're Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states\nThese are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now you want with Kavanaugh as well even that CNN did a\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point they have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't remember what\nHis platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive a that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America great\nAgain or keep America great again the Trump could run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump some trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but again a ... and\nThat's what I'm going\nTo win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nOne poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but you know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona\nI see a surge of just the right time for dean huh\nAt least no one can independently find anybody that was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the four people that's Julie sweating except we're at those parties one's dead to wouldn't returned our calls at one didn't do virtually sweating it was so now Democrats who used to hell ... and the media obviously\nAnother story but also the hunting on it but in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process in the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that\nI got to run but Joe country over the hill dot com you want to check out his work is probably the only media he is the only media reporter in the country that I Know that is actually fair and balanced and\nAnd he goes against the grain and thank you for a great job thanks so much quick break right back your calls on the other side of big

me that's extortion selling us telling the American people\n[noise] the only way you don't have any peace impressed shut up shut up is still a Democrat\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you gotta understand since the day Donald Trump won the left in this country those quote resistance in this country now that now emerging\nInto a mob and some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera all of this remember Maxine Waters set it\nIf you see them get a crowd get a crowd and you confront them and you follow them into department\nStores in gas stations and and restaurants and you tell\nThem you know wanted anywhere anymore okay well that sounds like you want something bad to happen\nAnd the fact that the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't be honest lie we see it in the project beret ... videos or ... it is either they're not telling Maxine Waters pet said they keep telling me not to say it\nThen you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it had that Hillary Clinton had the sheet Bernie Sanders to get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian da da\nDa and then had all of our deep state friends lying to the American people with unverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives\nThis is who they are there's nothing that they're running on the tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this\nWhat Trump said that we create jobs by giving us the largest tax cut and eliminating burdensome regulation and opening up bad ... building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs\nSo you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV

with him\nBut I just like to apologize to Kanye West or the kite seller comment and that just really disappointed me and I'm just straight to the point of going there but the ... on that and I just signed up on that it kind of a less ah put a\nComment because\nThat was totally unnecessary particularly\nI Know I'm the quiet and made a comment about mental health but that was that was extremely sensitive and I would like to ask you I mean it's very frustrating because it's sitting here and then President Trump a such a difficult time\nAnd let me digress a second I Would really like to say I appreciate the comment on your previous caller a spot to make a comment earlier I really liked the comment that he said he refers to himself as an American and I really like that but\nI Want to ask you what do you think about\nYou know not the water and everyone in Hillary inciting violence about they earn peachy President Trump why didn't anybody do anything in Murray Maria Chappelle and that's all the state senator from Missouri a year so that he said he should be is that the night it\nI mean it's it's because it's a double standard it's it's the if a Republican says anything\nThat is you know semi negative about anybody\nThey the media report on it and then force you into a corner and then say you should resign your office\nFind someone that says you should resign your office find someone that says you should be in you know impeached or or kicked out of office\nAnd they will put the the the pressure cooker on you whereas like if a Democrat does it if a democratic does it does it they just they look the other way because they say well this person's too valuable it's like the whole Spartacus moment is a great example okay\nRemember when Cory Booker had his whole fake Spartacus moment where he said you know you can kick me out of the Senate and I may be kicked out of the Senate for doing this but I don't care and everything that he was doing was all a joke in a show everything that he was a saying he was exposing had already\nBeen agreed upon was public knowledge and could be released to the public\nYou know if a Republican would have done that stunt lord have mercy I cannot imagine\nHow what the reaction would have been the reaction would have been just scolding in ridicule it would've been the open of Saturday Night live it didn't none of those things happen to Cory Booker because Cory bookers and African American Democrat and they protect their own\nWell again I Know I just went up knowledge I cognac and say that you know a ...\nNot only in my opinion embarrasses up in their Star State of South Carolina because you know that's not what South Carolina ... ... residents\nRepresent waiting uh we all have here is that what the call right well\nAnd and look I've done a lot of the view of the car and I was shocked when he said this I think he's better than that I just couldn't believe it that that's the that's the road you would take

I'm going to real well\nWe've got thirty seconds in a time to get into another subject here\nMr Mr Horwitz I appreciate that but I Do think it's interesting that you had it you discovered it and we couldn't get it right away like all the other text messages we had to wait until the final report\nRight now or to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong in the deal Jay face consequences\nRegarding vice well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker\nHe was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember became and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAny way now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed set a source\nDirectly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI I remember that you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel as soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon is an investigative reporter is what the hell\nReg Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like ... and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy that had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and again ... all was was the dot CA recycled in different news outlets\nFor the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nWell if there's one other event that occurs and that may turn friends that really I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from Margaret in may and they still have no evidence from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's led to agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he get fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting dreams come you're not being roses have a a McKay and a stroke page\nIt's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove confident and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI with ... through I'm sure record talking about the history book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a soft crew right look at this we have the FBI investigating a crime here that\nFact they can't find a crime by a page\nHas only ... well at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove him other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nIt is isn't that drama the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly have a conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is just a group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the

third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump\nAnd the hoped she'd say something that they could use and then and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker said it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following as\nWe as a pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department and the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funnel money so it

get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd it gets worse than that was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to

Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the

have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight to ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in atlas MD in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a bone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or it's an emergency you know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor\nYeah All right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total\nIn forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise] um and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care bound Asian you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seem to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice health are pushing me was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create ... ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots\nWondering insuring it using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone wants to talk about reducing the cost of health care\nI think the real close enough I was about ... upon us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock\nGather news and who's now offering free health care for everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance in that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nA accident or cancer how much we one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family five hundred dollars for a year or a month\nA month so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with\nThe economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the real ... and the the politician their heads in California is to send them an originality\nJust throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it the what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get meds cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we we can afford what what services the ... primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nAh so little stretching just brought a door explorer that access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses there's Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nThat everybody's welcome and everybody is priced at the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over and not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance we can\nLower the cost and and pass the savings on

vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics and he's a Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work in the back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democrat Party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections this is a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise] um and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America\nThat this was a process of the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation a ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is done and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness today just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be and show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump\nTo maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nEnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American to have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host at a at a parasite at this point they're the same\nThing they have she end up this rage or not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he'd been he's been called trees as they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this if this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made

[noise]\nEven if they run counter to our hopes\nIn a courtroom truth is about credible evidence [noise] strong opinions\nNow there's a lot of talk about ... ... applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize a what a five ... five application is actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true and correct the best of his knowledge and belief\nAnd that's the way we operate and if it's wrong sometimes it is if you find out as in any incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in the air that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed up as David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the phony Clinton bought and paid for dot the aid that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's\nThe one that recommended firing Jim call me he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller and now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under old and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled appearance before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over\nThe terms of the testimony and he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews and those closed Rosenstein\nAnd say well he prefers a meeting or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in this House Judiciary committee\nWell interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions for Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in\nHad Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes\nA to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh\nIs is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nAnd he got the people best able\nTo engineer to things software right it and make sure that it could be built a scale in case massive numbers of people wanted it\nYou want it to be durable you want it to be a reliable you want it to be easy to understand it needs to be mass produced civil\nYeah I mean for something like this to work and has to accomplish a lot of things and that's what the team it's simply say has accomplished this is a security system that introduced the notion of using ... signals in your home to connect all the components instead of wires\nThat those two things\nIt allows you to do the installation yourself which is nothing more than using the crack and feel tape on the back of the centers and detectors as you put them throughout the house that's all it is you put them or you want to be stuck in there on the doors and windows the walls wherever you want them\nYou deploy the motion detectors where you want them you do you have security age the cameras in mountains occasionally if you want them on the ceiling built into the wall or what have you but it's all up to you but the fact that there are no wires means everything you don't have to build out walls build them back and

supporting which is pretty fascinating anyway we just Eighteen days away from these all important midterm elections\nAnd what do we see we see that Brett ascend has now been exposed this week in Tennessee is somebody that is purposely lying to the people of Tennessee the same with Claire McCaskill we say that Christ in cinema is falling apart\nI mean literally ... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a fine to join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha McSally\nIs that fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so it seems a lot of pickups in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida both for governor in for Rick Scott who always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to adults\nHi is where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them John Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOf well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi when she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate\nAnd he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in a in a\nIn the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to take on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nNow West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nBut it's really look at like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with the Julian Epstein guy\nUh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up in the polls\nAre dug so where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think we're America stands and John and you are right\nOn fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think the New Jersey will go all the way because of his eight operationally democratic state but\nThe other states you cite so and I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I still have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective in the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look I yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the thing numbers John please go ahead\nThen there's an absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a\nNationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh uh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get to sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did\nAnd it appears to have backfired particularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular\nFor let me tell you what I'm saying I'm ready on TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for a pillow see if you stay home it's half of ... and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for a pastor and McCaskill and send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know bread on the news just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn in you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with pillows the in the house into the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually paying that\nThey're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it any more John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats had not talk about immigration for for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that's not that didn't work for eight years dug and the\nWhite white Donnelly withholding a bit of a leading Indiana is say a heat by you saying go the wall and he's saying oh impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian out of Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats need to be in the center and if we were a centrist party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we'd be doing a lot better I think you'd probably agree with that Sean\nHow is it possible the Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to me ...\nAll one word answers on Snowden's money so so you know raising enough money yeah ... that's what it's all about\n... and and and he's absolutely right because showing that when we asked in September and a national holiday there were ... when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want to ask you close your speaker didn't only twenty three percent of all voters said yes fifty six percent said no\nBut then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know that they're chapter that these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or or will they owe their votes to her fifty percent agreed with that statement only twenty nine percent disagreed of all voters so they\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hold the mortgage on these candidates and let me tell you it's a for for ... for someone who's involved in congressional races right now trying to defend Republicans the Democrats are pouring millions of dollars to the races right now\nWhat in the patio and he's ... Republicans project very tossed released to tapes and they are stunningly\nYou know revealing in terms of the willingness of campaigns to purposely organized a campaign\nTo lie to the people at Tennessee in the case of Brett us and to lie to the people of Missouri in the in the case of Claire McCaskill\nTo say one thing privately another thing publicly it tells me Democrats to when they have to they can expose who they are if they can't talk about impeachment which they want\nThey can't talk about immigration and being told not to talk about that they can't talk about raising taxes even though they want that they can't talk about Obamacare even though they want that I mean what kind of people are they if they have zero sense of honor honesty character and then I Hope\nYou are exempt me from being a person\nWill hire them to you but you know nobody's been listening to you because they were listening to you have a whole entirely different slate of candidates and frankly the Republicans wouldn't have a shot this year\nWell thank you take that as well as the fact that I mean notes on sale radical left so I I'm I'm a center right\nListen I your your style a Democrat listen this is a party that kicked out Joe Lieberman Lieberman is one of the most the Thin Man ever you know he's very very\nTop of his great on on national security issues horrible on social issues nicest person in the world but he's not left enough for the Democrats and they threw him out and he came back and won but I mean it says everything you need to know about the modern radical Democratic Party of Schumer and Pelosi\nAnd inhaling that Democrats would be better with that but yeah\nI Will take a break and we'll come back more de dum cha own and John McLaughlin are pollsters are next half hour we got a lot more to get into later on Michael Dell in Dr Sebastian Gorka will join us a Bill O'Reilly is going to check in with us today is book a skyrocket it right to number one on the New York times list in week one\nMigrants claim they're fleeing poverty and violence and are making their way to the U.S Mexico border President Trump threatened to shut down that border with National Guard troops to stop them from entering the U.S us\nOfficials are targeting a Russian woman for election interference NBC legal correspondent Pete Williams\nHer name is Elaine up cushy a Nobel she's forty four she's from St Petersburg now she's been charged here but obviously she's not in the United states so she's not under arrest the indictment\nIs not related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen presidential election\nWisconsin police are providing troubling new details about the disappearance of Thirteen year old Jamie ... the teen one missing Monday shortly before her parents were found dead in their home investigators say nine one one call place from a cost home came from her mother's phone devotees responded and found the door had been kicked in and both Denise cost and her husband James had been shot\nJamie was believed to have been in the home at the time of being so then the police have been unable to locate the teen and fear for her safety\nThe u._s. was calling off a scheduled air defense drill with\nSouth Korea to give nuclear talks with the north a better chance of success defense secretary James Mattis and South Korean counterparts made the decision at a meeting today in Singapore who wants to be a billionaire a lottery officials now say tonight's mega millions jackpot will be worth one billion dollars these folks would immediately stopped working if they won ... it'd be the first thing I ...\nI Would not go back into the office in ecstatic absolutely not all about long ago I'll probably start my own business somewhere else and you know these are\nThe jackpot a second to a twenty sixteen Powerball jackpot which was worth one point five billion dollars this weekend would be a good time to make a wish are falling star the ... meteor shower will peak on Sunday night you're listening to the latest from NBC News radio [noise]\nSunny nice around what book today sixty April Hi thirty four furlough sixty eight comes back on Saturday sunny and beautiful on Sunday was Seventy two for a high\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate of ships [noise]\nOoh [noise] that's\nNot your heartbeat crumble showing Sean's army on Twitter where where you get ...

hour or two weeks from today election day we have a new poll out Minnesota Public radio showing Republican Doug ward low is now leading Democrat Keith Ellison by seven points in the race for the attorney general in Minnesota\nOr into the uh Minnesota Public radio star Tribune Minnesota pole\nAnd it's now forty three thirty six in that particular race and um what's fascinating about this is I didn't hear\nYou know all the people that wanted all the investigations into judge Kavanaugh\nBased on you know guilt by accusation no due process no presumption of innocence word from any of the\nNo ... no Dianne Feinstein or no Corey Spartacus Booker and no Kamala Harris fascinating Kamala Harris was Iowa\nI you know what I say they're trying to turn to mellow or Cory into the the next Obama next savior of the Democratic party the next anointed one it is dying to find the right person okay what give me your best shot\nAt the bottom line is if they really cared about the issue as they said they did all that Cory Booker would be under investigation because those allegations made about an assault this weekend about am never mind what he had already admitted he did on his own\nOn top of Keith Ellison would have been investigated not one of the these Democrats have called for an investigation\nI don't know if any of it is true the person that seems the most credible here\nIs this

trust these polls I don't trust these people that make their predictions\nYou know I follow I I look at it I factor it into what my thinking is\nI actually think that we should act right now that every race every Republican is behind\nAnd know that if the Democrat wins for the house that that's a vote for polo see staying home with a half a vote for below sea and in every important Senate race

people on Twitter and and our other interaction\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nI look I don't know why are we just had Newt Gingrich on\nAnd pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigations and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on\nEconomic success fourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in\nIn fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly decided to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the other the say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they\nPretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am elated so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWell the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent cream tell him as a message has been moving the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really good for would do it with the conservative movement or they're going to vote with\nUs because just starting to see that this was a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN the politics of CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey\nWhat's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the all the black vote than any other Republican president\nI'll throw this day but if if we all believe in in ... the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do\nIf we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right on okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that have that natural talent flourishes ... the word or\nEducation from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within\nThat tells you the God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again he needs to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we have an alien Abul lights it flows from that but I think the leftist\nAuthoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort to identity politics\nChanging the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender is\nEvery four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a rat race a sexist massage in this Tacoma ... Lama foe but they weren't dirty air water they want to kill children and grandma throw over the cliff\nBut also they also hold eyes up to ... yeah and then one of the polar ice cap to melt\n[noise] why did we\nFind a woman and final thoughts here from pastor Darrell Scott also agreements with it what is you have a last name right Karim ... near near okay and David Limbaugh a David we'll give you thirty seconds by the last word thoughts today what's gonna happen and fourteen days\nI I actually think that we stay off the um the so called blue blue way that we might even retain the house\nAnd we're certainly going to pick up seats in the Senate We're gonna come close that we don't want to keep it I think as the pastor Scott said earlier said well there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black\nAnd I'm telling ya liberals can't stand this\nKanye and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's I think we need to go on a positive message nationalizing these last do\nWe how how great would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country has a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck that they could afford a vacation take the kids the does anyone there seven and be miserable uh but but they want to take their kids\nGo out to eat and not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things that this is universal this this humanity\nYes it is I really believe these next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I mentioned in stays consistent also I think that you know they're the script in the Bible says this isn't a weapon formed against the self prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation\nI'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that a lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans we gossip political party this year the same concerns that the Republican Party or shares\nRight good to see a both Korean we've got to let you go to thank you so much for being with us past they're always going to stay and when you're in New York and I appreciate you being here

find something I'm going to take that into consideration absolutely I I have a very open mind meantime\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that they interviewed several dozen people\nIn an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with first hand knowledge and then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself\nNow that's what they're saying and remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her met a foggy slurring of words so that's what the Democrats are citizens are credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh\nWhen he sat in front of them last week 'cause they they they they all have the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to\nThen we've got the the third incident which is the ... case where a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis\nAnd it bend a ten of these parties herself personally that there was Brett Kavanaugh one and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ... rolls and then lining up\nIn the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a whole series of allegations here look if as Byron York said the gold polls have moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI invest want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the best merge or actor assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember Dianne Feinstein\nIs for six long weeks\nShe had this back in July\nThere was a California state or California congressman that had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh\nAnd then of course we had the original hearings and not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously record in lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats and she is the lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but he has a history of\nOh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's\nRadical left political the attorney and so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week\nOf a friend of this attorney for professor Ford this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing was sending to the right\nA professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein and they were soliciting women to accuse judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety\nAnd this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI very expeditious very quick very limited in scope they were have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about book and trees and gang rape and one email sent a late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an\nAll girls school near Georgetown Prep with the subject line corroboration needed\nNever cats need to find people who are familiar with what slang terms were used by Brett Kavanaugh on his yearbook page meant and the devil's triangle and the F F F F F a warnings in there if you can ... any of these are willing to sign an affidavit pleased contact us\nThat's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for\nNow if it was truly limited in scope and we know that in the case of professor poured that they were four people she mentioned we're at this party some don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh\nWas at under the you know that one of your perjury in ... under the penalty of a felony here\nSo they all signed these affidavits all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection and the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event\nThat eye witness has said under penalty of a felony at it never happened what professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put mark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident\nSo I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond see whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave Paul said ... ... there's nothing else really left for them to do\nPlease use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say\nI mean well point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody to come forward please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again again and again and\nYou know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week now is turning to because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows\nThen the only thing they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of ... drink you know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted and came to liking beer liking bureau lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was a school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to uh blacked out\nI worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol I watched it up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for the people the numbers to and after two they lose it for some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and as a throw him out and they'd be walking straight\nHaving been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individuals individual is is it's an enormous\nYou know you'd see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all\nI learned a life lesson and it was good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so he got ... and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm more than ... interesting piece which I I found today and he said that he's a pollster was the Clintons pollster\nAnd he noted today that in the immediate aftermath last Thursday's testimony by\nFord and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but they found he found is the support for professional Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning of one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by running to research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you're on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority\nOf the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want\nNo this doesn't if this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better\nThat has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of six tests the then has it it it diminishes any chance they have it getting back their power and after two years of trying to destroy the president you know on a Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we got this election you're going to tune in at night\nAnd you're going to flip the channels are you going to be watching news channels and you're either going to be seeing

expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got an interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor Ford that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remember Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor Ford\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of

now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the

you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis is nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge town\nThis is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassinate me or cheat I mean when you when you have when you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into\nA an elevator to harass or senator over and over and

I I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalposts are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people um it it could take themselves seriously they said\nIt's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she said that every Democrat said that now they're going up but\nTrump is evil puppet master control in the FBI they're actually going to be as horrible part is an organization you know it it it it\nIs and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's life long reputation here on the line\nTo hear your kind that are doing\nTwo weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know ... you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on it you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse to discount discount them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective\nOn that that judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge\nThe Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this\nWith the same knee jerk or part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a hat but I but it\nUp you know the parents who bought a reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because you know well the FBI's pack it in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length and then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews and they will confront people with testimony and other towns and\nKnow yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that\nBut for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them then there's what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement\nNow I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why am\nSomebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass on the call me and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the ... the FBI people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them and it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous and\nYou know the irony that says hey look he he told me coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their ... with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so\nThat's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people\nThe Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing 'cause the FBI can't ...\nCan't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals but that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nTurned it around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link to one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former your classmates asking them if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cab and all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what do they investigating here if she's asking other if she's telling other people she doesn't know\nWhat are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer was telling people she's not even sure it with him she said well how did he was in the room\n[laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain it hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I I mean price or even counted as a credible allegations of the you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nThey'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to include holy wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those three\nIt would have been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and
