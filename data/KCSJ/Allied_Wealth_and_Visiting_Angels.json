three\nIf you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael is on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that every day stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and\nHow we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress\nIn your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors\nIn I mean I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nLowered talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of\nAll the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nNot heard a whole lot about magnesium ...\nAnd he was magnesium so important there's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and you for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart or beat who very important factor in life\nAnd I would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this was associated with a a lack of magnesium and the bunny\nSimply lack of magnesium ... too so it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that you need the magnesium in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first\nOf all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the uh after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case study of people actually taking the ... formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic type pen fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches\nThere's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you name seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that I use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting bone loss you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest\nAt well all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and is and I'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researcher it how do you get this into the system\nThe formula we have the count max formula is so fantastic because you get a\nPowder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink this cut down\nThis great my absorption rate is really a incredible because it it actually goes right into your blood strip\nAll right and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium gets absorbed into your blood stream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you

a great organization I'm\nHappy to be with lifeline they provide so much help to the community and help support that special programs at eh thirty some very happy to be there\nIt's a it's so great to see you again and uh we're going to be talking today on the show about lifeline and a ... rising people with what lifeline is and and really what an impact it's been for all of southern Colorado\nBut before we do that we have an annual event that you're sort of a really want to talk about today and what would that\nBe coming up is the eleventh annual safety of seniors conference sponsored by as thirty a and their circle of friends and it's a great event we typically have about two hundred and thirty seniors participating in this event every year and it's coming at on September Eighteenth\nRegistration is going to start at eight thirty and we just have to find that gay full as learning about and just safety information for seniors and a wide variety of information is going to be provided and a lot of time for people to ask any questions that they might have\nAnd we have about thirty vendors there that are going to provide a wide variety of information and so we would love to has as many people there as possible and we want to provide some great an education on safety for his\nGreat I remember when it was the first one I Love I remember the first one\nAnd it was very unique because it was a smaller gathering but it was really about really are influencing seniors to come and to learn about safety and that's just kind of state that's kind of where this has been and a what a great event it's been through the years and you it's nice to see it growing and people actively involved\nAnd it's just a lot of people there and so our goal today is to let you also know about it so those view that are listening will want to come\nYes um [noise] I had to get some information on some of the speakers were going to have and this is typical for most years we will have the police department there\nUm which will be our first and our lung talk and question and answer period we have chief gathering part coming and he will begin to poke around and out a little bit after nine o'clock and just go over ... updating as safety and information and crime information in\nPueblo and then and provided some time for anybody to ask any questions that they might have\nAnd then we also will have officer Brandon buffet there I'm just to answer questions that anybody might has so that'll be a great way for people to start a conversation about anything they might be worried about and then um we have some other programs later on in the day that will get some specific safety\nAnd we have we live in a great community um a lot of great support here\nAnd I think one of the one of the things that we often you know people get so comfortable in their in their life they get comfortable in their day to day\nAnd seniors you can just sort of lay down their guard a little bit and there are people out there that really want to take advantage of that I've done a number of radio shows a with our local law enforcement about fraud in\nThe in some of the types of things that that that are going on phone calls to our seniors and trying to build them out of things and I and I and I I'm not trying to scare anyone but I think this is a great place to come just to Research Center\nUm how you live your life what you're doing just to make sure that the ... if you're living independently ... where you are that you stay very cautious\nTo your surroundings and and uh it it ... it always helps to have more education about what's happening in the local community so people are really come how much does it cost to go\nIt's free so yeah it's free it's free and you get lunch and great entertainment as well so what a deal\nSo that's a ... the data this is gonna be September Eighteenth yet\nAnd that's a that's a Tuesday that's correct and if you come like you'd come early but if you're a thirties radiation begin mhm and when did when did the festivities\nCell and registration to eight thirty people have time to get a seat and walk around and visit our vendors and then we will actually have an executive director of ... Asher introduction and and then we will have chief down in ... shortly after that at ... little after nine o'clock\nBut they may have fallen and not told you and once we get into falls you know they can they can happen in series and then one day the fall is really the number one cause of why people die so ... did this is such an important topic and and this was a pretty affordable system isn't it Andrea\nIt definitely is and when you're considering um hospital possible hospitalizations I'm I'm a fall and especially laying there for a long time and\nIt's definitely something that you can be proactive with and and affordable product and that can help keep families face and keep ... parents at home longer and independent and help the children feel more confident that mom and dad are safe at home and they don't have to worry so much because they know\nThat if they were to have a fall that and that it's just a push the button and they can get help\nAnd actually we do have a son and units that have father catching him so with that technology even if somebody were to fall and hit their head and be unable to push a button and it's very accurate and get in determining a fall and will call for help\nAnd even if a button isn't pushed so um that's just\nThat's really great general for under fifty bucks a month mom or dad can still live at home even though you've got concerns about that they could still live at home they can get some help on the side\nBut if that helps not there no one's around that they do fall under fifty bucks a month you know you're really given them that independence that they're really seeking and then after that of course you got to you know you've got to try to mitigate that for the future but what a what a great program and and and talk about the apparatus what is it is it big as it's small\nAnd it's not bad and and the one with the fall detection has to be one around their neck\nAnd because that's how it detects the fall we do have some buttons that can be more on on the wrist and those are mostly for people that are more and just an ad in the home um by themselves sometimes and aren't really going out and about um without somebody with them\nAnd but with the ones around the Napoli has some that actually are on mobile devices that people can take with them anywhere and they have all the tension and on and and if they were to fall if they were at the grocery store or out for a walk in the neighborhood\nAnd it would detect that fall or they could push a button and and it has GPS locating in it so that and help but be able to find them where they are\nOkay so somebody wants to this is something that you know maybe a need for my mom and dad how do we get it set up how hard is it to get it set up at ...\nAt ... at the very easy and again you can just call the same number that you call for that the senior conference that's I mean my my number it's five for five when he went to jail and\nAnd just give us your name information and week well just figure out what kind of and questions that we need from asking some kind of questions to get the information that we need to get you all set up and our service reps are all local so that they couldn't get out there and probably the next day and get my my dad set up\nAnd so it's a very easy simple process and to get\nThat it's like this into the phone I mean they just have to connect it right so that it uses the phone system to be able to call so as long as there is a technical person they're they come to the home when they get that all set up so mom and dad are in good shape and that's ... that's the whole deal here yeah\nThis is good so if some of you avoided this and I know people don't want that added monthly fee and\nYou know oil as they go pass on that I'll just hollowed out for the neighbor you know I've heard all sorts of stories about that and I think it's really something that you need to think about so given that phone number one more time this is lifeline that they get something that you all should consider\nIt's five for five one two one two\nThat's great well this has really been a I think an important part of our community that is really stretch started out in Pueblo\nTwenty six years ago and now look at it going all the way to Durango\nAnd and as you know Colorado would have it there are a lot of really a lot of ... you learn a little tiny towns and\nIt's really nice because that brings technology to your town that brings technology to wherever you are yeah and whether you're in assisted living whether you're an independent living or at home or maybe you're living with your kids I mean what a great what a great opportunity to have that extra hand in the house for under fifty bucks a month\nYes definitely so what does that number to call once more\nFive for five one two one two\nGreat that's so easy to remember where if you want to so yeah we be thinking about life why and if you don't already have it I Know that they could uh probably take care of your pretty pretty quick\nYeah and I did I did want to mention that they don't even have to have a landline at home and we also have a mobile units and even with our new go safe to button and that doesn't have to be connected to the base unit at all so and there are a lot of different options and depending on if they still have a home phone or if they have a mobile devices\nIn technology grant and this is the thing that amazes me all the time everything changes\nWhat great we're going to take a little break right now and the senior living today show and a rabbit a great discussion with Andrea ... about lifeline and\nBut uh there's another special event coming and we talked about at the beginning of the show but as soon as we returned again we're going

showed America so we're glad that you're with us and today we're going to be talking about something very interesting and uh\nUh typically when we age we sometimes withdraw from the things that we love and we think we're no longer useful\nAnd I got a special guest it's going to tell you otherwise and so there are great opportunities out there we used to justice and who's a coach for entrepreneurs source is with us and we're going to talk about if you're a senior there are some great opportunities to continue to understand who you are\nWhat you are and make sure that you could be out and do something exciting good morning Lisa great to have you on the show\nGood morning David I'm so excited to be here good to have you here and I think this topic is just wonderful for us and and uh hey I'm sixty one hey I'm I'm thirty four or we go\nAnd uh we're the kind of aging folks that are that need to listen to the store so\nWe'll good let's let's find out a little bit more about what you do and then we'll talk about how our listeners can relate\nTo what it is you specialize in absolutely I'm an alternative career coach I'm with the entrepreneurs source there from that's thirty four years old with coaches located across North America and I have an office here in southern Colorado in Pueblo and I work with people locally including in Colorado Springs Pueblo and\nI'm canyon city and so forth but I also work with people a nationally and I get to have the opportunity of actually working with people on their dreams looking at possibilities option and dreams\nCreating a life that they've always wanted and looking for self sufficiency and financial freedom you know Seventy five percent of the adult population Dave desires to be self sufficient um however\nMany of us don't know where to start including me up until several years ago we always wanted to be self sufficient independent but I didn't know where to go so I get to work with people who want to go on a journey of discovery\nSo you never too old to become an entrepreneur\nI was I was in my early fifties and actually it looked like\nThe worst thing in the world it happened to me I've been with a fortune five hundred company actually they were in the top twenty uh and had been with them for twelve years very successful had a multi state team\nAnd uh the company decided to go in a new direction and so my position across the enterprise was eliminated and so here I was with this company that's a hundred and sixty years old thinking I'm safe\nYou know nothing's going to happen here I'm going to have my benefits I'm if I wanted to retire here I could uh I'm gonna keep stacking up that four one K. and then\nLo and behold they eliminated all of the people in my position and got rid of the position and distributed our responsibilities to I'm younger less tenured people and so I sat there and thought well my gosh if this could happen\nAt this point in time right is it safe to go back into these corporations that you feel like I'm you're going to stay with forever and earn that golden parachute so to speak\nAnd so this is great for you a new career in coaching people helping them find of the special qualities the experiences that they have to enable them to the you know sort of walk with them while they're broadening their capacity and broadening their perspective\nYeah usually when these things happen then it's a window of reflection it's a time when people are looking and saying what else is out there and they start to look at those those dreams of being their own boss doing their own thing and believe it or not there are so many people our age that this is happening to them in the traditional\nVehicle of\nHaving a job in working for a corporation um often times they've been very successful and then something happens with the the company and they're going to go their own way and their position is eliminated and they're sitting there going oh my gosh\nBut they've got gas in the tank you've got so much experience they have so many skills and so I get to work with people\nWho want to nurture their dream of being their own boss and being financially independent\nThat's exciting for those of you are listening I mean\nA lot of times we get compartmentalized in our in our daily operations you know you look at southern Colorado and many people were raised with the bill and yes or you've been working for the company and you know there's been so many changes because there are just like leaves a story where the company made a joy of change that affected her\nSo many of us in our fifties and sixties or know affected by corporations stretch they look you'd have a discussion of terrorists you know and and those downstream effects of taxation can cause a couple of you to change strategy overnight\nBut you know there's a lot of different models out there and I love what you talked about earlier when you when you think of what a franchise is a business model and that includes things like licenses and distributorships um you know it's basically what I call a system and if you think of the acronym S. Y. S.\nT E M save yourself significant time energy and money and that's one of the reasons why\nI Love this business is because people who want to take control their destiny can ramp up fast they can really the go quicker because a business model has already been established it through an audit of overtime tweaked in and brought up\nUm and there's just so many different things out there for people to look at\nAnd as well said I mean it is a team sport and I've told so many people they said well I Want to do this business but I'm going to do it on my own yeah um and it takes sometimes three four times longer to do it yourself and it does to\nTo to get in capitalize it get a team working with you and take off fast and and that three or four years of time you use to grow something as you could do it in half the time you take a look at the resources that you pick up\nAnd the momentum that you gained so ... it was a great way to ... to interrupt\nYou know absolutely and you know doing start up completely from the ground up there are people out there that can do it and they're very successful at\nIt this is just a different model for me it's about efficiency I have a I have a girlfriend that she can she can create a financial platform a marketing platform and operational platform you know an HR platform and she can do all that from the ground up and you know ... you know hats\nOff to her um but for me I'm like I talk to me about a financial system oh my goodness no way I mean so so for me having these platforms and having them tweaked in on it at an already that's what really that's what really is good and you know basically when you look at franchises people think that they have to have the technical skills Dave\nBut you were in visiting angels\nWhere were you a gerontology\nForce officer and I'd never even been to a hospital and they were just piling yeah well I did television shows here I'm going to fly but what you know what the system helps you to learn those skills\nAbsolutely and that's what people think they think that you have to have the technical skills but most of the time there's only two skills you really need to have success in business model and to run it well and that is managing operations\nAnd following a system and that's because you know you're not always in the business you can be working on the business\nBut you know the really neat thing about it is that the clients that we work with and you know this is the meat thing there is no cost to work for me or work with me no cost whatsoever there's no risk there is no obligation I get to work with people all the time who just want to go on a journey of discovery to look at\nBusiness ownership and is it is that right for them is it the vehicle for them to get those possibilities options in dreams that Ninety five percent of clients we work with\nGo online to in a business that they wouldn't have considered on their own war had looked at him prematurely dismissed and part\nOf that is because they don't know everything else is out there and part of it is because we back into it we look at what are the things you want in income lifestyle wealth in equity we don't want you to buy a job yeah we want you to have the benefits that you want\nSo that's good I I think that you know this discovery process in everybody's life is the light bulb that comes on and you're sweating you're saying you're willing to do this for free\nAbsolutely and you know when it's a dream job Dave I mean you love it to you always knew of always talk to me about the the CEO of your life go make things happen just print up some cards and that's when I get to do all day I get to say hey let's get some clarity around it and you know what if you find out that this isn't the right vehicle for you\nThat's wonderful to because you've reached a point of clarity\nIs right and I'm Talking to your listeners right now because a lot of you are my age and many of you are older\nAnd you're thinking hey man I've done it's all washed up I waited for Social Security and the bottom line is you know we have entrepreneurs out there that are ... that are running home care companies ... we have people that are just starting at my age of sixty one they're just starting ... and they'll be doing that for Twenty years as long as you're alive\nSo it really is never too late to discover\nWhere your gifts are absolutely any now are expected life\nIs eighty five years old now I mean so what are you going to do with that time and think about things like leaving a legacy for your kids I mean what if you want it to you know and it was this was the big thing that I thought about my daughter\nIs entering her senior year of college and I've been talking to her I was talking to her all last year oh my gosh you're halfway there you know you're going to be senior these are the wonderful things I can see you traveling the world and you know she's a photographer a photo journalist that journalists and stuff and I said I can see you out there\nBeing a contract writer on travel around it and I was talking all these dreams\nAnd I was applying for positions\nThat made me go to sleep when I thought of him and I thought hey what about our dreams and how we telling our kids\nYou go live the dreams in the life that you want and yet we're sitting here and what are we do eat where soccer if I were were settling day were settling for us you know and yet that that really let it only sent have always wanted to be\nAlways wanted to be a business owner and when does elimination by position happened my eighty three year old mother\nWho had always heard my dream of being a business owner basically said well you better get on it it looks like this is your time\nThat's right that's right I Will tell you what if you're listening to the show right now I'm this may be a chance for you to just to think about is that me do I still have ... to become a business owner where to find out when we get back we're taking a break right now in the in your living today show we'll be right back after these ...\nThere's no matching the services like I'm Ryan

you brandy in Sean thank you thank you will ...\nWill thanks for taking the time to to uh to come along you know I'm One of the things that are um I don't know too much about and I've seen Humanae I just really excited about learning more about what he meant it does\nAnd I know that you're both based out of Colorado Springs but you serve a larger area so tell us a little bit of humanity and then how how you function or in this in this area\nAll right so human is a complete Medicare company we also um [noise] are so Brandi and I are both full service agents so we cover all products\nSo that's where we come in and we actually live here in public Colorado and we branch out so we were technically work from homes or working\nHotel okay with the whole office get up in the springs to cover that larger that larger ...\nCorrect yeah so you man has been in business for over fifty years or they started out in the nursing home business they kind of branched out purchased hospitals kinda got through that side of it and started working into the Medicare realm\nOr that allowed them to start out getting Medicare Advantage Medicare supplements prescription drug plans and then they brought us agents in where we actually do the whole spectrum you know life health annuities everything\nYeah I didn't I didn't know how large this spectrum really was so brainy what ah so ... what kinds of products are you do you handle specifically amount or do you kind of handle everything\nWell we we handle everything actually and we are full service insurance agents with Indiana that's what we call ourselves and on our business cards and you'll see it and it says\nUm you know service agent or sales agent we're not here just to tell people things were actually here to\nEducate people on health and wellness he managed to health and wellness company a lot of people don't realize that either so we offer a lot of different programs that are not just Medicare and not just dental and vision not just life insurance but we also had to educate our community as well\n[noise] well that's that's really important parts\nThe show it's really educating our listeners to what's out there but one of the things that that I think when I look at this topic is is that\nWe don't plan enough um if you're a senior in your aging or your son or daughter oftentimes we don't react like we should until there's an issue and then you wonder well I should have known about that or I should have done that earlier\nAnd so is that something that you both run into a lot when you're talking to families about uh any one of these issues is is it really bringing people up to speed and letting them know that now's the time to do this um how does it work for you\nSure um we have we have a lot of confusion especially when we say the N word Medicare yeah of course and\nA lot of people aren't sure what to do so that's what we're here for in the community to educate and and start planning for if you're sixty ... you need to think about when you're turning sixty five you need it thinks are thinking about those things now what's going to be available for you and what are your options going to be\nYeah you want to make sure if you're a veteran you have if you have veteran benefits or you want to make sure how that last or I guess you could say the last quarter of your life is going to play out\nUm unfortunately we do run into where we're doing\nA life meeting and nobody's looked at their life insurance plan for Twenty years ago I got one no big deal well who's your beneficiaries polled the pull the plans outlook Adam\nUnfortunately make sure they're not to you know accidental plans because we run into at all the time were an accidental\nInsurance plan accidental\nYou know I don't I never made it gave me years ago and I want to have it now\nYeah it's an accidental death so that we're OK yeah sorry they they actually have two accidental death policies where they don't pay out unless you die from an accidental death right where you know they're thinking they had life insurance and as soon as you know mom or dad passed where we're going to be able to help pay for this funeral or what ever happened\nAnd unfortunately it doesn't so we always do a review and we make sure we tell everybody pull it out at least every five years make sure you're beneficiaries are where you are\nMake sure nobody has any cognitive issues where they can't make any decisions anymore we need to change those beneficiaries we do all of that and then well so do the Medicare review to where we okay do you have your everything set where you need to get your Medicare\nWow so random when you go in and you get an appointment\nOr do you have you have so many umbrellas here we're talking about I mean this is there's a lot of different facets that humanity does do you usually get called in to a meeting on one specific basket or when you're called in by family she's sort of do a a big review of their entire situation\nNormally it it well it depends on the situation of course but um a lot of people will call us and say we have no idea what's next we don't know what to do this just happened or that just happened to her hand turning sixty five and two months and I don't know what the heck I'm doing\nIn the big picture um are the changes from Obamacare a ... there's a lot of high level stuff\nOut there and maybe we don't even want to go down that road because I I think none of us really know and maybe you don't either all where this is all going and so you know a lot of times you're just trying to to to to provide products that really meet the needs of the of the clients white here in southern Colorado\nThat that that need so yeah we'll avoid that subject but I think\nYou know where where it's all going I'm sure we all scratch our heads and and maybe you know humanity is no different you try to you know to continue on this track 'em in the time that we have I Do want to talk about some of the supplements and Medicare and I must admit I'm One of those that I don't know a lot about it\nBut the the Medicare ... supplements I think are valuable you can you wonder if you explain that to where we position is\nIn our families and our futures\n[laughter] so that's where we as agents branding I go in and we make sure so the first thing is what you know like I said before what keeps you up at night while I'm worried about hospitals I'm worried about these so we'll do that needs analysis so supplemental are what they are\nYour Medicare is going to pay first or even your individual and then you're supplemental insurance is going to come in and pay what's leftover or depend on the plan what small co pays you may have or out of pocket you may have\nUm [noise] you'd does range from there's got from a through and\nSo those are quite a few out there that you can kind of look at and very they're very impressed too so\nYou may be paying your Medicare premium plus you have to pay that supplemental premium and that's where a lot of families may not be able to afford that bigger premium so then at that point that's where we go okay well let's look at this other option which may be Medicare Advantage\nAnd I think brand new can cover Medicare Advantage a little bit more on that side\nYeah and with with the supplements to you also have to have a prescription drug plan a lotta people\nOn that we run into they were like why do we even I don't take medication I don't want him a prescription drug plan\nA lot of people don't realize that Medicare penalize if you if you did not get a prescription drug plan when your Medicare start and that penalty goes for life so it's kinda scary to think about but that's where the Medicare Advantage comes in and we kind of put everything altogether\nOr we kind of think about it as a Sean does it really well as a combination played at the Mexican restaurant where we we put it all together we put your medical your prescription and everything else all in one plan and it really covers everything under one umbrella\nSo when the chips are down we need to solve so we need to we need to solve you know and this is I think this discussion is really good because I Know so little about it and I've said so many times this is a team sport\nYou know this aging thing is a team sport there's so many things that we don't know the island theory is the more you think you know the more you find out you don't know so you really need a a team of professionals around you\nUm we're talking with you man a brand new Johnson and Sean modest and uh and uh what I'd like to do is just quickly just cover if you if they've got questions on this subject and they would like to\nDo to have some more information is there an office number that they can call you at\n[noise] I'm actually um our office as we stayed at the beginning of the show is in Colorado Springs the best way to get a hold of Sean and I are on our cell phone okay and my cell phone number is seven one nine to fix three five five and Sean's is seven one nine to three seven four or five one night\nThat again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it or will be able to to give you more this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that face with families you know you walk into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming next I mean we we don't know what's going to happen\nAll insurance is or what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect you and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nThe defense team yeah yeah because you're going to see things coming that we don't see that are still sort of amazed at how complex\nThis whole this whole system is showing how 'bout you what ... what are some of the challenges similar or do you if you walk in and you've dealt with families I'm getting there do you think getting their affairs in order maybe one of the big things people need to think about\nI think ... affairs in order huge because we'll all my kids can just throw me outside or my kids can pay for things and you're gone\nNow I ... I bet you if we made a phone call they'd probably say how much is it what do we need to do so um but yeah I I Would say truthfully we're all used to a corporate world where we have an HR person that says here you need this take this\nWhere we all retire and all of a sudden we're going what do I do where do I go\nThat's where you could say brandy and I are your age are person 'cause we can help direct even I'm a big believer even if he didn't pick Humanae at least we helped you make a good choice in what you're going to do next right or where to plant and what to do\nYou need a strategy and the guy just so I think this is a great discussion than they were going to ... come back and just a few moments in kind of close out the show and we'll give you the overview to Humanae now you're

know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are\nDeficient in vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and it's not there\nAnd the statistics show that back in the seventies when we

said hey guys keep up the good work\nNow you mentioned earlier that there's a strong connection between vitamin D and diabetes talk a little bit about how your fast smelled the three formula could help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nWell he has diabetes is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin and the bodies but the insulin is not recognized by the south and so what vitamin D street does is it takes that problem and it seems to fix it now\nThey've studied vitamin D three and it didn't prove this

being fatter\nYou'll find your energy better you'll find less pain less arthritic type pain more mobility flexibility better muscle strength and if you're someone who is concerned about falling you don't have better balance and a better sense of walking which is so important is that\nSo and and how do you take a doctor biggest\nYou can take it in the morning you could take it at night you don't

working right if you stop and the health issues come back well there's your answer\nThat's the best test that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence\nYou go I Wonder if this is really

I know that you're both based out of ...\nThat'll springs but you serve a larger area so tell us a little bit of humanity and that how how you function the in this in this area\nAll right so Humanae is a complete Medicare company we also um [noise] are so Brandi and I are both full service eight years so we cover all products\nSo that's where we come in and we actually live here in public Colorado and we branch out so we were technically work from home\nOr work I Hope they're okay with the home office get up in the springs to cover that larger that larger peace\nCorrect yeah so you man has been in business for over fifty years ah they started out in the\nNursing home business they kinda branched out purchased hospitals kinda got through that side of it and started working into the Medicare realm\nOr that allowed them to start out getting Medicare Advantage Medicare supplements prescription drug plans and then they brought us agents in where we actually do the whole spectrum you know life health annuities everything\nYeah I didn't I didn't know how large this spectrum really was so brainy what uh so what kinds of products are you do you handle specifically amount or do you kind of handle everything\nWell we we handle everything actually and we are full service insurance agents with Humanae that's what we call ourselves and on our business cards and you'll see it and it says\nUm service agent or sales agent we're not here just to sell people things were actually here to\nEducate people on health and wellness humanity is a health and wellness company a lot of people don't realize that either so we offer a lot of different programs that are not just Medicare and not just dental and vision not just life insurance but we also try to educate our community as well\n[noise] well that's that's really important part of the show it's really educating our listeners\nTo what's out there but one of the things that that I think when I look at this topic is is that we don't plant enough um if you're a senior in your aging or your son or daughter oftentimes we don't react like we should until there's an issue and then you wonder well I should have known about that or I should have done that earlier\nAnd so is that something that you both run into a lot when you're talking to families about uh any one of these issues is is it really bringing people up to speed and letting them know that now's the time to do this um how does it work for you\nSure um we have we had a lot of confusion especially when we say the N word Medicare yeah of course and\nA lot of people aren't sure what to do so that's what we're here for in the community to educate and and start planning for if you're sixty you you need to think about when you're turning sixty five you needed to start thinking about those things now what's going to be available for you and what are your options going to be\nYeah you want to make sure if you're a veteran you have if you're a veteran benefits or you want to make sure and how that last or I guess you could say the last quarter of your life is going to play out um unfortunately we do run into where we're doing\nA life meeting and nobody looked at their life insurance plan for Twenty years ago I got one no big deal will Hoosier beneficiaries pulled the poll the plans outlook Adam unfortunately make sure that they're not to you know accidental plans 'cause we run into at all the time were accidental\nInsurance plan accidental you know I don't see that made it gave me this years ago and I want to have it now\nYeah it's an accidental death so that we're OK yeah sorry they they actually have two accidental death policies where they don't pay out unless you die from an accidental death right where you know they're thinking they had life insurance and as soon as you know mom or dad passed where we're going to be able to help pay for this funeral or what ever happened\nAnd unfortunately it doesn't so we always do a review and we make sure we tell everybody pull it out at least every five years make sure you're beneficiaries are where you are\nMake sure nobody has any cognitive issues where they can't make any decisions anymore we need to change those beneficiaries we yeah we do all that and then well so do the Medicare review to where we\nOkay do you have your everything's set where you need to get your Medicare\nWow so red when you go in a unit appointment um do you have you have so many umbrellas here we're talking about I mean this is there's a lot of different facets that\nIn the big picture um are the changes from Obamacare a ... there's a lot of high level stuff\nOut there and maybe we don't even want to go down that road because I I think none of us really know and maybe you don't either all where this is all going and so you know a lot of times you're just trying to to to to provide products that really meet the needs of the of the clients white here in southern Colorado\nThat that that need so yeah we'll avoid that subject but I think you know where where it's all going I'm sure you we all scratch our heads and and maybe you know he met is no different you try to you know to continue on this track 'em in the time that we have\nI Do want to talk about some of the supplements and Medicare and I must admit I'm One of those I don't know a lot about it\nBut the the Medicare ... supplements I think are valuable ... can you what have you explain kind of where we position is in our families and our futures [laughter]\nSo that's where we as agents branding I go in and we make sure so the first thing is what you know like I said before what keeps you up at night while I'm worried about hospitals I'm worried about these so we'll do that needs analysis so supplemental are what they are\nYour Medicare is going to pay first or even your individual and then you're supplemental insurance is going to come in and pay what's leftover or depend on the plan what small co pays you may have or out of pocket you may have\nUm [noise] you'd does range from there's got from a through and\nSo those are quite a few out there that you can kind of look at and very they're very in price too so\nYou may be paying your Medicare premium plus you have to pay that supplemental premium and that's where a lot of families may not be able to afford that bigger premium so then at that point that's where we go okay well let's look at this other option which may be Medicare Advantage\nAnd I think brandy can cover Medicare Advantage a little bit more on that side\nAnd with with the supplements to you also have to have a prescription drug plan a lotta people\nThat we run into they were like why do we even I don't take medication I don't want him a prescription drug plan\nA lot of people don't realize that Medicare penalize you if you did not get a prescription drug plan when your Medicare start and that penalty goes for life so it's kinda scary to think about but that's where the Medicare Advantage comes in and we kind of put everything altogether\nAh we kind of think about it as that Sean does it really well the combination played at the Mexican restaurant where we we put it all together we put your medical\nTheir prescription and everything else all in one plan and it really covers everything under one umbrella\nSo when the chips are down we need to solve so we need to we need to solve you know and this is I think this discussion is really good because I Know so little about it and I've said so many times this is a team sport\nYou know this aging thing is a team sport there's so many things that we don't know the island theory is the more you think you know the more you find out you don't know so you really need a a team of professionals around you\nUm we're talking with you man of brandy Johnson and Sean modest and uh and I would I'd like to do is just quickly just cover if you if they've got questions on this subject and they would like to\nDo to have some more information is there an office number that they can call you at\nI'm actually on our office as we stayed at the beginning of the show is in Colorado Springs the best way to get a hold of Sean and I are on our cell phone okay and my cell phone number seven one nine to three eight\nSix three five five and Sean's is seven one nine to three seven four or five one night\nOkay and and we're going to do that again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it or will be able to to give you more this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that that you face with families you know you're walking into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming next I mean we we don't know what's gonna happen\nAll insurance is or what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect you and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nThe defense team yeah yeah just because you're gonna see things coming that we don't see how that are still sort of amazed at how complex\nThis whole this whole system is Shaun how 'bout you what ... what are some of the challenges similar or do you if you walk in and you've dealt with families I'm getting there do you think getting their affairs in order maybe one of the big things people need to think about\nI think ... affairs in order huge because we'll all my kids can just throw me outside or my kids can pay for things and you're gone\nNow and I bet you if we made a phone call they'd probably say how much is it what do we need to do so um but yeah I I Would say truthfully we're all used to a corporate world where we have an HR person that says here you need this take this\nWhere we all retire and all of a sudden we're going what do I do where do I go that's where you could say brandy and I are your age are person because we can help direct even I I'm a big believer even if he didn't pick Humanae at least we helped you make a good choice in what you're going to do next right or where to plant and what to do\nYou need a strategy and the guy just so I think this is a great discussion and uh hey we're going to ... uh come back and just a few moments
