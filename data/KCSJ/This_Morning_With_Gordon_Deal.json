Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolffe says cases challenging the timing methods funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happens with abortion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways it can be restrictions on the timing or the method or the funding that cetera\nAnd then mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts um strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they um um allow them but in more cases than not they strike them down\nBased on what they understand to be\nSupreme Court precedent to those cases you know move along through the pipeline and they take you know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they are likely to do as much as they possibly can and these cases his spot them down and say we're not going to take them or whatever that lower court case decision was at the federal circuit court federal appeals court we're going to let that stand [noise]\nSo that's going to apply with one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nRight so the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but it points you can say now it seems like a good time\nAnd it's like well yeah another which the court gets um what's the number the court gets like eight thousand ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about ...\nPercent of those and the cases it takes a rider important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where circuit courts those are the federal appeals court to the level right below the Supreme Court\nAnd they they're sort of regional there are regional circuit courts and those are often split I'm two or three circuit courts may have ruled one way on an issue\nAnd one or two or three Supreme Court ruled another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this show a lot of these cases coming to the court on abortion now not reflect those kinds of circuit split the court can actually say\nI'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now and these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they are directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court could simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled stands report\nJust wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides and the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court and might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year\nSimply doesn't want to do anything that might be seen as partisan\nWe're speaking with USA Today Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can say we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well please\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another [laughter] let's say because it's often the case\nThat anti abortion plaintiffs uh those bringing the case I\nWant to go to the Supreme Court and say hey you know we want to ... a a twenty week limit on abortions or we want to outlaw certain type of abortion and the second trimester or we want to outlaw\nAbortions that are undertaken touch a particular reasons like sex or or or the disability if the fetus the court\nThe Supreme Court only gets involved and says All right we're going to hear that case not because it's interesting because it basically has to because the lower courts are ... of course ledge because legislatures in court and don't know what to do because there's a conflict between appeals courts\nAnd that doesn't happen very often I mean the last major abortion case that the court took a on the subject of the actual medical abortion as opposed to things having to do with like you know harassing\nPeople outside clinic or something like that was back in two thousand and chef and it had to do with partial birth

several major a major markets have noticed a flurry of reasons steps\nMore from USA Today business reporter Nathan booming who's been researching this make them what's going on\nYeah this is really interesting story I I was surprised to see that Honda's our susceptible to everybody that this is a climate is\nExisted for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with late model Honda vehicles specifically the accord and civic although some of their hunt as as well are being targeted by the two are\nRealizing that beat airbags can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases they break into the vehicle they they basically ... out of the steering wheel and then they sell it on the black market\nAnd in ... with what just anybody who happens to be in an accident and blow the airbag or is this tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens is that when you need the gear bag replaced you have a couple of different options course most people are going to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop get replaced their\nUm some people ever going to get\nA day on the side they're going to have a friend or they'll go to maybe more disreputable\nType of repair shop and that's where a lot of these types airbags ended up being sold if you actually go on E. bay for example in the search for this you will see their airbags means hold on line so it's it's definitely happening um and it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealerships something you're not going to end up accidently buying a\nUser airbag or something but there is a market for these things\nShe saw it and the reason that it's Honda's because they're popular vehicles and just happened to be more of them perhaps on in ...\nWell I definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that Honda's of long way targeted for theft but that's in part because of the fact they're popular but we don't make much sense to me is why only because in talking to the police and various markets um\nYou know almost every incentive looked at it was exclusively on this so what do you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with the actual specific Arabic conductors or something and exactly what it is\nProbably the thief themselves are the only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nSo it is these are what uses a nice ... kinda strips away the covering of the center part of the steering wheel and just pulled it out I was at work\nThey somehow gain access to the vehicle and then they basically a use a knife and then they rip it out and it only takes a few minutes I to some incidents where\nYou know they hit a dozen vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night show you know it's it's definitely um\nThere's not a difficult thing to think about it this is like you know as a laptop out for the seat in the car I mean if the left towards a thousand dollars [laughter] that's about how much this\nIs worth so there's a big incentive for the season you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the Dakota one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up so\nBut there's also no well we're seeing with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece in to the police the flurry of Honda airbags deaths as criminals aimed to resell on black market how do you protect yourself or is there is there a best practice here\nA few different to you you probably consider here number one is we see in a vehicle near St late or near a parking lot late that can help because these aren't going to choose a vehicle that's way under the late that could make them easy to spot\nSecondly I hadn't thought of this you can try not to park near a big vehicles that are maybe a structure\nOf the the view so when the the kind of hide behind the big SUV or big truck that's one thing to consider it unless they in some

its current political divides Wall Street journal executive\nWashington editor Jerry ... says it's a storyline that carries echoes of the twenty sixteen presidential election in one that could bring the same kind of bitter aftermath Jerry how do you see it\nWell I think we're going to end up with divisions again you know because the way to mid term is shaping up and and by the way you know they're still three weeks ago and that's an eternity in American politics today so [laughter]\nPredictions are very dangerous spot if you were to take a snapshot today you say it looks as if the picture's improving somewhat for Republicans\nBut Democrats probably still have the or in a good position to take back control of the house because a lot of those house races are playing out the swing races are playing out in suburban\nDistricts where they're Democrats are stronger and where's the college educated suburban women I become a very strong democratic constituency so they seem to be a good position to take back control of the house but at the same time\nRepublicans look as if they're in better shape to keep control the Senate\nOr in some measure because the Republican base was very unhappy with the way Brett Kavanaugh was treated as a Supreme Court nominee and that has kind of energized the Republican base and reminded them that they like having Republicans pick and confirmed judges and so\nAh the balance in the Senate will be determined in a bunch of red states where there's a lot of pro Trump support and so\nYou're going to have it you could very well end up with a picture of a divided Congress and Democrats thinking that they uh have won a a a national\nVote in an ass it's the same way they did when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote twenty sixteen but don't have a very big hold on political power if they simply have one half of Congress and so\nThat's a that's a recipe that is probably going to produce um obviously divided government has a hard time getting things done and it's a continuing democratic anger at their opposition within the political system\nStarts so there's no ... for example uh [noise] I'm no lessening of the divide because the Democrats let's say when the house and Republicans maintain control the Senate because there's more balance I mean\nWell ... you know that's possible and in order a couple of issues interestingly trade maybe one they're actually may be some common ground you know there are a lot of Democrats who are\nCloser to President Trump on trade and his use of tariffs and um basically challenging allies on trade issues there are some Republicans are Republicans have tended to be more free traders [laughter] so you may actually have a slightly bigger\nBalance of support for the president I'll trade in a divided Congress but on most issues and particularly on health care it's going to be very hard to get something done 'em and I think you're going to have\nA and if he if Democrats do in fact take back control of the house there's going to be inevitably pressure from the Democratic base to begin investigations of various um activities in Trump world including potentially\nA reef revisiting the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh but also having a look at some financial dealings with the president and the aftermath of a mall or in investigation and so you definitely going to have a more confrontational atmosphere in Congress or if there is democratic control of one house\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry ...\nHe's written a piece about how the election is unlikely to end the political divide that we're seeing you're up to that a\n... and I want to ask the forty incumbent House Republicans who are vacating their seats with this feeling about a democratic wave be different if the ... the majority of those forty we're sticking around\nI think it would be I mean I think it's a big deal a you know some of it it's actually more than forty depending on how you count so it's a big number and you know some some of those are the Republican incumbents were going to be in trouble in this environment anyway so they you know got out while the getting was good\nSome of them probably could have better defended their seats than a newcomer can answer that opens the door all the wider for Democrats is actually I think one of the unappreciated factors in in this campaign is the amount of open space Republican\nRetirements left for Democrats to move in and one of the interesting things that's happened in one of the reasons Democrats feel good about house races is that these democratic challengers in swing districts where there's an open seat or Republican U.S left", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city":

worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people say that the reason they're holding back as soon as the you know worried about the economy began not a whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year a lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows that even on a sunny day somebody's worried about right\nNow we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending about my generation what's that break down\nYeah you know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending and the inclination to save more as the reason for rolling back\nSkew younger so millennials in particular lead the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend ... also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on my spending Gen x is not far behind um but it's so similar trend there\nMost inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to say more money\nBut that's changing ... baby boomers those are the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back\nOn their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter] but when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth and the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that you're particularly for baby boomers it better in the workforce\nStagnant income is still very much an issue\nThat much of this is a recession hang over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it to say\nOh what a generation Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking this up on their own\nSo certainly with millennials I we've seen this this is no fluke I mean we've seen this in a number of different surveys that we've done over the years you know some of the things that you and I talked about in the past ... millennials have a greater inclination\nTowards saving a they have a little less of a consumption focus and they're more averse to debt than what we have seen from preceding generations and I think a lot of it stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand in the case of older millennials or\nSeen the impact that it had on family members friends older siblings are just as you were sort of in those financially formative years has undoubtedly had in the fact that we see that manifesting itself in a number of different ways you know in this case it's that that focus on saving limiting the spending in order to save more money\nLike Greg Greg McBride chief financial analyst at ... dot com twenty minutes in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning

patriotism but there's a book to both an up and coming crop of recently elected congressional veterans who are sort of shutting the framework to to bring other vets in and then\nThere's a few dozen veterans running on the on the Democratic side\nOr the vets a seemingly willing to do this\nSo this has been a who's been sort of a two fold every one is um folks in the Democratic party of said that veterans have been a habit of coaching at parties say where we're interested in running a and the same time the Democratic party has a has a number of different things that it's putting into place\nTo to welcome back in the party so for instance there's a couple a couple of first term a first term Democrat in the house of representatives to put together fundraising apparatus take a leadership role in the party and uh have have really come out to support so veterans who are coming up behind them and the system\nIs that right is that number correct that there is a hundred and Ninety nine veterans

Democrats are trying to win with help from military veteran candidates\nUm there was one analyst directs burger observer and your story you said a military service doesn't necessarily translate to the best candidate for office which seems obvious but what was the point there\nRight well the the point there is that ah with with any military that treadmill when you're running sometimes the the iconography of uh of running as a patriot the background and expand\nIt's a bit of the military or can can can issue warn people want to be in one trick pony so that the military service\nCan become the the summer there are some of the parts and right now that's that's a strategy that that some folks are using if they're if they aren't veterans themselves and they're running against that turns to say hey look yeah well you know like\nWe we appreciate we appreciate the service but you know there's there's other occasion but there are more important\nAnd in this very partisan environment a rise election cycle [noise] um there there are there are observers who are saying you know the end of the day you need to have the best fit for the best for the congressional district and\nHow close are they going to shoot at a party line and in some ways that can come back and hurt folks who are pledging to be independent voices you know maybe they don't have that they don't have the the bona fides that are needed to say they're going to work with work with their particular party\nIn a year when voters oftentimes are are looking for people to align with them politically that's why they do vote for him\nYeah I Know it was ... I think there was one woman in your story you said that was a while she was choosing a particular veteran because he seemed willing to compromise with the other party\nWell the the the one woman I spoke with that I think illustrates all you know talking to a number of different people said hey I'm really I don't like the partisanship that that that's happening in the country\nI don't like the direction we've gone I Wish people would talk across the aisle but at the end of the day I Want to make sure my party when so there there there are a lot of voters that I've that I've spoken with to have that\nTo have that um have that opinion and I wonder what people to work together and yet I stole my party to win because I think my party is the one that's going to work with the other

and founder of GDP advisors ... is this possible with the president plans to do\nGood morning you know it's actually possible for where the president can control certain things so specifically the proposal that ha just outlined targets Medicare's reimbursements specific drugs are administered in physicians' offices and so the Medicare system itself\nCures roughly forty percent of all drugs in the United states actually it is the consumer of these drugs for\nUnder mandated law how it's going to pay for these drugs actually has the power to go back and say this is Medicare is going to pay for these drugs this is how it's going to work and doctors are prescribing and and the ministry and these trucks are only going to get paid to some out\nOkay so then the pharmaceutical companies if I can try to guess what they'll say is well that's fine we now will no longer have enough money to do research and develop new life saving drugs\n[noise] that's the argument that they're already making on the heels of this announcement is that a visual strife in their ability to reinvest or even make minimum bottom line requirements are of their cars and that's just reached out in the right direction I think upset for a long time\nThat the federal government being the largest consumer needs to act more like a consumer\nUh and and how they're paying for drugs and\nWhat President Trump said yesterday is absolutely right in the U.S pays in some cases twice as much as other foreign countries\nThe challenge here though is that it's it's what the US page that helps subsidize the what the other countries at the end of the day this is still profit margin issue for drug manufacturers\nRight All right so is that approach than anti free market or no because we're describing\nThe federal government as a consumer\n[noise] yeah I I don't think it's a market for that part because the federal government in this case is for the consumer the government is not shutting here\nThe government is just saying what they won't pay for these drugs and show in in this we can't remember the ... to the doctor and minister drug blood pressure medication or standard over the counter type stuff [noise] this is specific to drugs specific to like cancer multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis\nSo these are high cost drugs all ready and the government's saying we're not going to pay as much now is also a problem because it's the way the Medicare system works and this is specifically what this is targeting Medicare part B is actually the\nPiece of Medicare reimbursement this and it pays doctors a commission for ministry and they struck the traditional Medicare part D system which is a prescription drug plan to get out of the weeds here there's an\nUnintended adverse incentive for doctors to do a administered drugs just prescribe drugs and this challenges that at face value\nAnd we're speaking this morning with ... and he's the president and co founder of GDP advisors were talking about President Trump's attempt to lower the cost of Medicare drug or why are the costs of drugs so high by the way what are the basics here\nWas a couple of the things one is and it's just absolutely pointed out in a real problem is that the U.S government as well as the U.S consumers subsidize the rest of the when it comes to\nCount as you have and this is a multi layered complex situation is that it takes roughly on average two billion dollars to bring a new drug to market and that is largely based on FDA requirement upbringing that drug now\nIn order to offset the cost and recoup the cost to do that the U.S patent all also gives factors of twenty year pat and\nThose manufacturers are really good about tweaking the drug at the end of that Twenty years later they keep it for a little bit longer to this is a complex issue if we weren't caught a great first step but we also much reduced the regulatory requirement to bring trucks market soften that allow foreign testing\nUh in in certain countries to be allowed in the U.S to reduce cost so you can have more competition and let the free market do what it does best innovate and compete", "year": "2018",

systems for Mr Sessions' recusal from any investigation into President Trump's twenty sixteen campaign\nYet the lack of direct involvement has also provided space for Mr sessions to execute an agenda on immigration criminal justice in other areas with far less distraction or scrutiny than usual\nHere's Wall Street journal Justice Department report or CD Grumman city what are we seeing\nIt was very noticeable that Rosenstein to tag and you know sessions the attorney general we're having a very different experiences leading the Justice Department you know while a Rosenstein was so into the White House an answering questions about the uh\nYou know the Russia investigation going to the hill and answering questions about you know this trove of documents that Republicans in Congress were seeking sessions was just basically traveling the country and beyond a happy about things like violent crime and terrorism\nAnd as time has gone on that has become more apparent including when it is actually say that it's traveling to the international cheap the police station conference\nIn Orlando with trout a that is something that would be very close to a session heart\nAs somebody who is a big fan of local law enforcement that he's in France for the G ... summit so it just kind of an interesting little reality for both of them\nWell these are the conservatives are pleased with what sessions has done\nI think they wouldn't normally be pleased with what sessions has done but I think that a lot of Trump's allies are really sort of you know set at sessions like trumpet for stepping aside from the Russia investigation ads for you know just allowing Mueller's investigation to progress as\nIt has so I think in any other sort of environment a session to prioritize immigration and violent crime and that you know drug policies um you know we're getting credit from conservative but that's not necessarily happening at the time\nWhen I say you were speaking with Wall Street journal Justice Department report or CD girl and she's written a piece titled the split screen existence of Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein used it to that ah there's going to be a renewed focus on immigration in the coming weeks for Mr sessions\nWell that that um actually I think that's still true uh that was a stray that was written back in may but um and that we really thought migration burst onto the seat after that but I think that's still true it still\nDefinitely a high priority for session but you know I think right now they're kind of just looking toward what's going to happen at the Justice Department after the midterm story right now is about you know whether\nTrump is going to um you know fire either or both of them and whether they're going to write that on their own accord so it just kind of like oh wait and see I think\nDoes seem to be a strange relationship at times\nAh all yes for both for all of them and the president they get you know our reporting has shown that Trump and Rosenstein actually get along fairly well at Rosenstein has done a pretty good job of keeping the present appealing but president in such a way that he's been able to keep his job\nAnd continue overseeing the Russia investigation but obviously sessions relationship with the president is totally true rated for that little bit different\nWhen you said of Mr Rosenstein and Mr sessions often talk about other things that are happening in that agency\nYeah it's I think when they're together they're talking about day to day affairs you know what is going on they don't typically talk at length about what's going on with Russia I mean sessions has recused from that so you know he's not getting briefed he's not getting a you know updates about the investigation\nIt's interesting fascinating stuff what else uh jumped out at you as you were pulling all this together\nBut I just think it's interesting that you know sessions which you know not only really damaged his relationship with Trump but just kind of\nUm you know separated him from his the department that heat lead\nAt a time when it's getting involved in some of the biggest you know stories of the day like immigration I guess well Rosenstein and hit the answer to a lot of the complaint from Trump and his allies session has really gotten sort of executed agenda you know peace in relative quiet because the focus is on ride and what he's doing\nAnd says sessions has kind of just been you know traveling talking to a local law enforcement grew I'm getting that he really likes and stay out of the cauldron of

... debates Wall Street journal reporter shipped cutter has been sampling workplaces in and says the stew of politics and gender surrounding the new Supreme Court justice have made this moment notably personal ... what have you found\nPolitics have really spilled over into the workplace and so we heard a lot of different examples of people saying for example uh that that they weren't having really kind of intense conversations with some of their colleagues\nWe have examples in this piece of people going to their bosses confided in them about really personal experiences of sexual assault um one CEO how to tell his employees to tone it down the ... the political debates we're getting too heated of a broad spectrum but just showing that this was something that really couldn't be avoided at work\nGoodness I I mean it did it cause enough friction where somebody might want to quit or they're pushing and shoving or yelling\n[laughter] well we heard I talked to one person for example she works at a a distribution center in New Jersey and she said she really had to her tone as a group of men in front\nOf her work walking into work and trying to kind of really get into this and she felt she just did not want to engage so I think some people had to try to suddenly redirected conversations their tongue not engage because they just knew that they didn't want to have a heated conversation at work\nThat that that's almost like Thanksgiving dinner right you eat it at work void religion politics things like that\nFor a long time this is politics have stay out of work for a number of people told us that they don't but it's it's no longer possible that you you do bring them selves to the office\nThat the issues that you're you're discussing outside of work of course are going to become a into the workplace and one person I spoke with made the point that we don't we don't have a third place for these discussions anymore that there's home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time so of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I I've done it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is just the company is called the Bateman group and they have offices in New York and San Francisco and a partner at the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefit to the company had to deal with this uh and and what I thought was interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slacker them they'd had had to set up for the past year\nThe flack room was called ... resistance and it was a police for workers there to really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room\nAnd if they didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates on what was happening and this was a good form for them and do it out\nThat while we're speaking with just cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the work place I can imagine to some managers are no may not be worse than having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nDetroit I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia\nAnd he said that he's had to tell his his small team that there really is just no please for political bickering network he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he could take care of him he's the one who paid your salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see what happens is we can determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps\nUm but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door just try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have\nAn open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there they did have concerns or wanted to talk about politics and then we'll go from there\nHow much of this uh boils down to gender battles\nWell I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are some ... these are gender issues that but I think that we we heard on\nOn all sides of this that they were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think and then we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they did not feel that uh just kept an eye was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really [laughter]\nAcross gender lines across guy economic lines up with something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out of work where we spend so much more time\nWhen he's chip all Street Journal reporter ship cutter it's twenty

morning\nWhere do we stand on the Trump terrorists Yahoo Finance columnist or ... new man has been doing a deep dive by talking to business owners on the front lines and joins us now tell us what you found out about talking to the owner of a battery business in Texas\nSurveying a lot of different business owners here we go fight as to get their opinions on the terrorists\nAre some don't like them but some actually do like them and one of the guys I interviewed was a guy named queen Robinson who run the company in Texas that rebuilds or industrial equipment or alternate heirs and starters on automobiles and on um some bigger equipment used in the ... energy industry\nAnd he's getting hit from he's a he sees the tears from both sides so\nUm he's he has to pay more now for some materials that he uses his business which is rebuilding or some of this equipment but he also favors the terrorists because he competes against a new equipment new alternatives and starters that are made in China\nSo the price of the competing product is going to go up\nAnd he thinks that's going to help his business eventually he thinks that may actually help him raise his own prices eventually him pay for the higher cost he himself because his own costs have gone up on account of the terrorists so it's complicated I mean that you know the waiters plays out in the real world\nIs not nearly as simple as some of the sound bite you might hear politicians are spouting on TV\n[noise] what kinds of price supplies um is he looking at it is it that the ten percent or higher\n[noise] it's a I think the ones that are affecting him that the cost increases affecting him or the steel and aluminum tariffs\nShow you know he buys some parts from suppliers who in turn to get their stuff from China or a show in some cases their pay either a ten percent ... now an additional temper center works on the twenty five percent tariff also the steel and aluminum tariffs\nUh apply not just to imports from China but from most countries\nSo a imported steel and aluminum is getting more expensive so he got he got notified by one supplier or the price that the price of the product if he needs to purchase is going up ten percent ... percent more for that product and at some point you're going to have to raise his own prices\nA in order to cover that increase in cost but\nYou know there if you're if you're the seller in this case you have to figure out well\nAs my customer going to pay the extra money and how do I sort of carefully raise my prices without of sending my customers away so what he plans to do is he going to eat the it out and cost until he sees the competing products going up in price which it has to do because it's getting more expensive also\nAnd he says well not product goes up the price that is what he's going to raise prices so ah all prices what kind of go at the same time\nWe're speaking with that Yahoo columnist Rick Newman Rick in talking to this gentleman could you tell it all it's his feelings have changed in either direction on the tariffs\n[laughter] that's interesting because when he first um reached out to me saying he'd be happy to talk about that she was

interesting turn\nA because yesterday and he said Mr he said yesterday in fact um I got notified by my own suppliers of my costs are going up so I'm paying more on account of the terrorists but I think it's going to help\nOr on the retail and he said look I still favor the Trump terrorists are in one of the points he made is that it his business he has seen a lot of the U.S businesses small businesses such as his own just disappear\nBecause ah they cannot compete with\nA with cheap imported products from China and I'm In many cases they make the case that the court in products are low quality products that there are there they're not built to last um that you get you know if you're the consumer you're getting something inferior\nBut a lot of times uh you just don't know that or you don't care and you know you have to make at some point in time you just have to go with the cheaper products so he's one of these people who feels that the Trump cares may actually rectify a

Michigan business dot org\nWell markets go up and markets go down you can't panic over every move or you'll go crazy so says market watches Maria ... who has some tips for us on how to remain calm amid volatility Maria how can you keep yourself from freaking out\nSo it's obviously hard to do you know this week was really crazy in the markets the Dow fell more than a hundred points on Wednesday so it's easy to get caught up in that but the truth is if you're a relatively young investor you should you know play the long game as history has shown and\nNot get overly panicked about every bad day at the market has\nWhat the problem with constantly checking all your accounts\n[noise] the thing is you know most of us are probably not going to be getting the money out of the account that day so\nWhat you're the number that your account says can either be really exciting or really disappointing but the truth is it's probably far off from what it will be when you actually cash they account out\nI'm at is different obviously for someone that's retiring tomorrow or has another really short term goal but if you are investing for the long term you know the number that it says ten twenty Thirty years before you're ready to have your money out it's not super important\nMaria what's the best way to get money put into your four O. one K. or even Iraq the IRA\nSo many experts say the should just be something that's automatic and so if you haven't signed up for some kind of automatic deposit and cheer for when Karen IRA or something like that um you know definitely try to do that if you're tempted to panic maybe just say okay instead of panicking about where the market today\nCan I look at my budget is there any wiggle room for me to amp up how much I Am contributing to my retirement account and time spent doing now there's a lot better you know time spent than just hyperventilating\nMaria what about the importance we've talked about this a number of times of making a budget and or evaluating a budget you've already made\nYes so it's it's a good time to just take a look over it again I'm it's possible that something that's changed maybe you've gotten a raise or maybe the opposite has happened you know maybe you're\nIn the gig economy any business has been slow lately it so it's always a good time to just kind of reevaluate um you know look at the normal things that their subscription or a cell phone plan you can negotiate on and maybe bring your costs down um all of those things can have really big ripple effects for the future if you can just take the time to do it today\nWe're speaking with Maria lasagna of marketwatch memory of what is the downside of spending money to make yourself feel better when you're stressed out\nYes so if you are trying to distract yourself from the headlines you know maybe try not to treat yourself to a shopping spree or something like that um you know retail therapy can really catch up with you\nA lot of us are already severely in credit card debt I'm the U.S has the you know more than a trillion dollars in credit card debt so it's not a good time to contribute more to that\nUm so you know there's plenty of free things you can do go for a walk you know go for ... even watching TV is better than going on a shopping spree so try to do pretty much anything but that\nAnd with interest rates rising this just a time now to pay off debt if you can\n[noise] exactly so we are going to the interest rates probably arise several times this year or so um you want to get ahead of that before your credit card is charging you even more and interests so if you can pay off as much as you can now that will really pay off later\nOn the positive side of higher interest rates some banks may be paying better rates\nYes that's true so um if you're looking for a new bank account um or even if you're not you probably should just see that they're really great options out there um Goldman Sachs markets that's almost two percent on a savings account which is huge ally bank of another one\nSynchrony bank they all have you know pretty good on line savings rate so if you're getting just the minimum that your normal um you know if you're just thinking at chase or something like that you're a savings account probably doesn't deal that much so look into some of these online banks and see if they can do better for you\nAnd Maria this is a great time to try to find a side gig or another job if you can swing it\nYeah we're also heading into the holiday season though there's some seasonal jobs that you

to strike the U.S humbled houses now trees\nTore down power lines along the Florida Panhandle hurricane Michael a category for when it made landfall near Mexico Beach Florida yesterday ranked as the strongest storm to hit that region since at least eight teen fifty one when recordkeeping began\nMore now from Jonathan ... senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel he's with us lives mourning mourning jobs and just how bad was Michael\n... morning Gordon yeah it's not every day that you see a category for making us landfall but uh you know a Michael was pretty impressive and that uh you know a lot of these hurricanes when they approach the U.S still tend to either hold serve or the week and a little bit as they approach land but Michael is\nIntensifying just as it was getting toward land in fact the lightning and it's I was with making landfall\nSo yeah this was almost a category five hurricane and ... the to give you a perspective on that or they're only been three or continental US category five hurricane on record Andrew Camille in uh Florida Keys Nineteen thirty five Labor Day hurricane so this was this was one intense hurricane landfall\nBoy and and the the aftermath now is what this thing is ... moved north east across George a writer or the Carolinas threatened here by rain\n[noise] yeah that's right right now ah the center of Michael is now just over a year or go to Georgia and spread it all of its rainy into a parts of the Carolinas\nMia Appalachians and or over the next twenty four hours it will just move a pretty quickly to the northeast across the Carolinas\nIn the southeast Virginia and spread some rain or as well along parts of the north east seaboard including a south east New England they produce an inch of rain or so on its northern blanket to New York city in Philadelphia\nBut fortunately by friday or this thing will finally be able to see will be done with it\nI think this compares to some of those other big storms I feel like it's slightly different because it didn't hit a major metropolitan area\n[laughter] well that's true you know uh you know with apologies the Florida Panhandle you know it's it's um you know if you think about the places where hurricane could hit and do the most damage or think of the places where Michael didn't get it didn't hit New Orleans it didn't hit Tampa\nOr they need Houston uh so it's a it's a relatively lower population swat in the ... still hit very hard\nBut ah I guess if there was a small solar relieve a certainly as far as the the the the overall damage figure from this is that it hit a relatively unpopulated area of the Gulf Coast\nYeah why such a little time to evacuate as some people say to Florida radio show host on earlier said that shouldn't be the case you to Florida is good about giving people a Seventy two hour window but I was surprised that some people said they didn't have time to pack up\n[noise] yeah I mean part of it is part of it is due to becoming so intense so ah so close to land fall you know it just kept intensifying intensifying that's something we we never liked to see but certainly the national Hurricane Center National Weather service had a watches and warnings out well ahead of this they usually put\nA watches out a good forty eight hours ahead of times and uh we we knew this thing was coming you know a good three or four days in advance uh but uh\nI think the intensity and ferocity of it uh you know I\nI personally did not expect the borderline cat five later today so I think that may have been a factor\nThat's something we're speaking live this morning with Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel I hate to even ask when you and I have these conversations what's the rest of the season look like either I don't know next couple of days or weeks well\nYou know we still have about six weeks of the hurricane season left that typically goes to the end of November ah right now there's a there's a couple of systems out in the central and eastern Atlantic not worry about the Wesleyan the deed\nOr there could be some develop in the western Caribbean next week or that will probably stay up buried in Central America and that could be a flood threat so you don't see any us threats or over the next week or so but again the hurricane seasons do can go into November leaks do could get a surprise here and there\nYeah you know I was I was thinking about this the other day the hurricane season runs June through November Man that's half the year but the concentration of this stuff the worst stuff seems to be my wrong like September October\n[noise] no you're absolutely right or really the peak of the hurricane season are usually goes for about the last um the last two weeks of August through early October that's when you get the the worst of the hurricanes and the biggest threat to the United states\nOr just because of the warm water in the low wind shear that's when the

Panama City Beach Florida is that they show it category for her\nAnd I I have to say this is a bit surreal is a meteorologist watching this or we go look back into the historical record there has not been a category for landfall along this part of the Florida Panhandle or the Big Bend Florida you know we're bands of ...\n... any historical records dating to the mid nineteenth century so what we're seeing today is truly an unprecedented event\nWas it a surprise that a jump to a category for\nWell you know I'd have to admit uh looking at this last week we were expecting at least a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico but uh you know I I'd have to be honest I was not expecting a category for landfall\nUm you know it's just basically been such very or go to Mexico water temperatures in just some some optimal wins a law that allows the such rapid rising motion in the ... the hurricane and it's just take it off in the Gulf of Mexico far beyond what I expected it\nWell so ... would be roughly what middle middle of the afternoon\nIt looks it looks like the eye of a of Michael should make landfall in the early afternoon\nNow are somewhere between Panama City beach in Appalachia cola Florida and you can kind of think of this is kind of a somewhat larger version of hurricane Charlie if you remember fourteen years ago Charlie ran like a bond saw through a southwest in central Florida as a category four\nSo unfortunately the this has got to drive a massive storm surge possibly nine to Thirteen feet above ground level I mean can you imagine night at Thirteen feet of water outside your front door a so you know really if anybody's\nStill along the Florida a Gulf Coast they only of hours left to get away if they if they in order to any that evacuation\nGoodness which we can live this morning with Weather Channel senior\nDigital meteorologist Jonathan burden the are are are are there were the comparisons to Florence which struck the Carolinas last month well\nYou know it's interesting because actually this is probably do some of her as you possibly get to Florence and one of the big differences of course the intensity or looking at a category for landfall as opposed to Florence spinning down to a\nCategory one it reverberate with words ... slow crawl through after line is when that produce the you know the feet of rain and the ethics flooding that occurred for weeks afterwards or what we're\nSeeing with Michael is again it's much more intense\nAnd it's going to accelerate fairly rapidly through a southwest in central Oregon an end of the Carolinas\nA Thursday on Thursday night and really by this time friday morning it'll be off the east coast in and out of the way so it's moving the good news is moving quickly but it get it to the ferociously intense storm unfortunately for the Gulf Coast\nIt seems so a bizarre the kind of the historical perspective you gave before about this type of storm not hitting the Florida Panhandle in so long or ever but I like listen I'm up in New Jersey so I think Gulf of Mexico I think hurricanes big storms ... why I guess not those area [noise]\nYeah you would think so I mean I I'm I'm looking right now at a map of all the historical category for hurricane tracks the Gulf of Mexico and you know there there's been a number of them that have hit the Alabama Gulf Coast the Mississippi Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas and South Florida\nBut there's just this strange gap a from a north of Tampa or through say Appalachian coal and Panama City that has not seen it has not seen a category for landfall and it's sometimes it's just the steering wheel in the atmosphere that when you get the really intense hurricanes like this\nThey tend to go further south and then further west in the western Gulf of Mexico and not so much hitting the Florida Panhandle Gulf of Mexico or so since it's October the steering which tend to steer it more towards Florida than toward the west or

I'm On the ballot there are a lot of Democrats and now after defense each day hold against Republican challengers in the mid term election year so we have a lot of ... already sort of in a structural imbalance against the Democrats but\nAt the moment it seems like they're forty nine races in which the Democrats either are up for re election or heavy elite in polling and fifty races in which the Republicans you to hold the seat or at least in polling and then there's one way stories in Tennessee that's essentially tied so the upshot is could go either way\n... [noise] how about a ebbs and flows as I Do know particular issues come to the forefront in any given week does that does that happening\nNot really I mean it was so we've seen for example recent polling in North Dakota which shows the Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble that's not surprising it's North Dakota it's a very red state uh there's been some indication or or or I should say some some\nAh we're cool arguing that a high camp is suffering from support for Kavanaugh that ... that she wasn't immediately on board with a supporting Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nHas been pointing to as a reason that she's a falling behind there but it is a state that the Democrats have consistently had trouble in any way so I'm not sure that's really the case the main thing that we're seeing is partisanship\nThat in states where there are a a where Hillary Clinton won for example Democrats and do well in states that Donald Trump won\nThe new well there are some outliers like West Virginia where Joe mansion still maintains a lead a despite the fact that he's a Democrat in a very red state as a general rule no it doesn't seem to be swayed by ...\n... we're speaking with Philip bump national correspondent at the Washington Post she's written a piece in Delaware the fight for the Senate stands right now um how much could things change over the course of the next month there was starting to get really locked in here\nTo some extent I mean we were starting to see where races are starting to separate to some extent and what that means is that parties will then stop putting money into those races which means that those races will become even more solidly out whatever color they were training in the first place I guess we're going to see some of that really this is going to come down to a handful maybe five Senate seats\nOn election night which will determine control of the Senate I think the house\nPretty likely to to go to the Democrats at this point in time the Senate continues to be a big question mark\n... what were those that did you ... five thirty eight crunching numbers than they about are the odds of one party cleaning the house in the Senate\nThey did yeah and so those numbers change a lot depending on what polls they get in but essentially it is that Republicans have about a woman by chance of holding the house the Democrats have won five chance of taking the Senate\nOkay so you were to it like the some of the gubernatorial races correct any any notable similarities\nWhat's remarkable about the gubernatorial races is that if you look for example the Senate map and look at the state of pulling there there's a lot of sort of politically areas where the Democrat and Republican or running sort of even\nIf you look at that map though there are a lot of states where there is an incumbent Republican governor who is going to win re election right so you look at a state like a Maryland or Larry Hogan is very popular looks like he's not going to have too much trouble running for reelection even though it's a blue state\nAnd there are a lot of reasons for this one of course is the fact that the Democrats have a map on the side so you're going to see 'em a few were ... great voices they're simply because there aren't a lot of\nYou know strong popular Republicans are up for re election but another too is that there's obviously a big difference between state and federal and so people in Maryland is like Donald Trump but like the job Larry Hogan is doing and Hogan and other Republican governors that represent blue states\nActually came out and said hey let's let's put the brakes on this Kavanaugh nomination which is a sort of thing that you can do as a governor you can't do the Republican Senate\nLike Philip Philip bump at the Washington Post\nWorks on the program is roughly by our friends\nHas dropped by co founder of Microsoft and the ... four hundred list of the richest

and Eighteen flu season was notable for the record breaking levels of flu illness and hospitalization rates throughout the country tragically there were also one hundred eighty Lou related pediatric debts\nReminder of just how serious blue can be as the new flu season approaches time for a review on how best to protect ourselves we're joined by Dr Schaffner infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville working with the CDC doctor what should we know\nThere's going to be a flu season that's the thing we should all know more severe severe but it will be here how nasty which means now it's time to get vaccinated\nIt's all rolled up our sleeves the recommendations are so simple we don't have to think about if you're older than six months of age yeah\nYou're eligible for vaccination we should get vaccinated to protect ourselves as well as everybody around us you don't want U.S Britain virus this nasty virus ... anybody at work\nIn in your family at home and your house of worship don't be graded spread or\nGet vaccinated [laughter] how difficult is it to create the correct vaccines these days\nWhere we have lots of options there's the standard flu vaccine and for people age sixty five an older this is important because they get more serious complications\nThere are actually two vaccines that are licensed especially for them\nOne is called simply the high dose and the other has a fancy name called the ... vaccine that just means there's an immune stimulant in it\nThe pharmacies and doctors' offices almost all have one for the other and that's great for people age sixty five an older and Medicare will pay for it you don't have to worry about that Mm\nI'm do vaccines make it more difficult to battle the flu strains\nVaccines don't make it more difficult in fact they are the single best thing we have available to combat the flu\nAnd we want to ... emphasize people age sixty five an older those younger than eight sixty five we have an underlying illnesses such as diabetes lung disease heart disease or immuno compromised and a special shout out\nTo women who are pregnant and back flu vaccine is safe it protects the pregnant woman\nWomen who are pregnant when they get to have a very high rate of complications have we don't want that\nAnd then there's a bonus the protection they make actually passes a cross the placenta gets into the newborn baby and provides protection to the new baby after its Bork well so that's a bonus\nYeah we're speaking with Dr Bill Schaffner infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville they're working with the CDC as we head into flu season with some tips on preventing flu or any read on what these this season is going to be like who is worse than last year uh not as bad\nBut read is that there will be a flu season beyond that or a crystal ball is cloudy and that's why we just say let's get vaccinated each and every year I don't think I Would have tried to anticipate or is this going to be a bad one just go ahead and get vaccinated that's the best protection\nThat flu vaccine will protect against\nAny number of different influenza virus strains within three or four vaccine to very get the one that's in your doctor's office or that the pharmacist recommends\nWhat about uh what about the spreading of germs let's say you you do get the flu what's you know how do you use yourself or use your own body to prevent it from spreading others\nYeah so it's it's very simple\nThe CDC has a take three approach get vaccinated number to try to use hand sanitizers and hand washing frequently and avoid people are coughing and sneezing\nAnd if you should get sick don't wait call your health care provider because they may prescribe an anti viral drugs which can reduce the duration of the illness they get less likely you get complications and make it less likely you'll spread it to others so that's a comprehensive approach\nDr Schaffner infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news [noise]\n\nYou don't often find the words business and

closer in November that Medicare for all it's an idea has really taken off far more than even the supporters of it expected like they were they taught us that something more for the twenty twenty\nPresidential elections and it\nKind of emblematic of the struggle going on right now within the Democratic party be you have sort of the more liberal side is wanting to do more aggressive policies such as Medicare for all and then you have some of the more centrist Democrats crafts especially in conservative states that are like whoa we do this we could\nAlienate some of our more a kind of a centrist democratic voters so that's really the the the battle and the debate that's playing out right now\nBoy who supports this ah well I'm ... this is obviously the idea was first I'm kind of brought forth by Bernie Sanders and his idea of a really it's it's a Medicare for all that is a single payer\nHas now at this point a gardener um sixteen or actually Fifteen core sponsors because Al Franken drunk or on there and um there's now a Medicare for all ... in the house\nI you're seeing a lot of um sort of the more younger newer faces who are challenging incumbents who are supporting us and also in in a lot more of the liberal states you're seeing that you know become a real talking point in Minnesota I'm with dean fill up\nAnd then on the Democratic side as well who is saying well well well we need to go easy here\nI think it's the um uh individuals like men for example who ran who didn't fully come out in support of Medicare for all\nYou see people like I'm In West Virginia who are ... a mansion who is um you know taking a much more cautious approach a number of candidates who are saying look what we really need to do is fix the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd build on that versus kind of throwing out I'm the baby with the bathwater\n... speaking with Wall Street journal healthcare policy reporter Stephanie Armour or pieces gold some Democrats want Medicare for all others aren't so sure how much of a role by the way those the slogan itself play Medicare rule versus say the phrase single payer system\nYeah that that's a good question when you when the parents go out and ask people voters about Medicare for all the support is strikingly high\nAround Seventy percent but you know the Medicare for all that\nHas gotten the most interest of the brain theaters plant in the form of single parent is single payer and so if you ask people what they think up single payer as a form of health care that that dropped precipitously show I Do think some of this is quite frankly a lot of people don't really know what Medicare for all isn't even among the Democrats\nThere's you know widening support for more watered down version such as allowing people to buy into Medicare is what the options even though they're technically not I'm old enough\nSo that kind of where I think that was going to hit the road as that goes forward as Democrats are going to have to come to some kind of consensus on what they mean what they want and as we saw with Republicans and their efforts to repeal and replace a theater that's not an easy task\nIs there a perception among those who support Medicare for all that the government is good at running programs\nI don't know what it would go so far as to say it's a good at running program that I think they\nThey are building on the ... the popularity of Medicare itself which has you know high\nApproval rating some its beneficiaries and conserve has a positive connotation the public\nAnd I also think they that they see this as a way to expand health care coverage to everyone on as well as a way to ah ah lord us health care spending which I Would say the the critics of it being manly disagree with\nMedical groups would rally against that I presume because there'd be less money for them\nYeah there is that the federal government generally in almost all cases pays a lower reimbursement rate for care and um private payer such as insurance companies do their concern obviously about lower reimbursement but also\nThey're looking at it as okay let's see you overhaul the complete healthcare system they're saying that this is going to mean what were the last my coming into hospitals which then will cause massive job losses in the industry is their argument or their concerns", "show_name": "This Morning

is to blame for a good chunk of this are they actually dumping it in the ocean or they can't process what they have were being sense\nWell yea for quite a while they were happily accepting garbage a plastic garbage from around the world you know 'cause ... other countries didn't know what to do with it and so we are other countries which ship it to China and that that was something that was well no we would ship them our garbage and our plastic\nAnd for whatever reason we didn't no one really seemed to you know see no evil well you know it's we've shifted there we didn't really know what they did with it well you know could very well be they were just don't make it into the ocean\nAh we we don't know because we don't really ... track that but they have actually China has stopped accepting trash from other parts of the world that was the last couple of years so that that will no longer be a a dumping ground for this plastic\nUh so where where other countries are going to have to figure out what to do with it a rather than just dumping China\nWe're speaking with soil rice science reporter at USA Today has ... where did the trash in the great Pacific garbage patch come from and how do we stop it you quoted somebody in the stories that\nAre ... there were these wonderful cleanup efforts going on but that's a waste of time largely we need to spend more time figuring out how to keep this up out of the ocean\nWas just mentioning that this is a pig to the\nTo the ocean cleanup project which is a very noble and nobody nobody saying you know necessarily that it's not a good thing but uh that uh it's this project developed by a Netherlands company a very young guy started about a few years ago he was Eighteen at the time\nAnd it's the ocean cleanup project and he's invented this kind of this large scooping mechanism that he and some of his colleagues there believe will uh\nWill actually be able to soak up for school up a lot of this trash and the ocean if it's successful we'll go out and uh you know tackle the actual patch later this year at ... years to come or having said that to some experts are saying that really Ninety five percent of our focus should be on",

don't end by the great recession and more recently the rise of online retail sites like Amazon and others so now watch here's Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man Jordan what's ahead\nWell it's going to be a big downer for the holiday season or they're going to be liquidating lots of stores are probably at least a hundred and fifty stores and then all the merchandise is going to be kind of dumped on the market right in the middle of the holiday season\nThey have about Seventy thousand workers good number of those will be laid off just kind of what happened earlier this year with toys R. us and it just kind of the ... the whole retail market\nSo which ... the lessons here or what they missed out going on line with\nTheir way through high there they took on a huge amount of that they have five point six billion dollars in debt on Monday they have a hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment they couldn't make which is what kind of ...\nUh the chapter eleven filing um they had too many assets as far as all the stories that were not kept up well\nPeople just didn't go to theaters anymore and they they lost Amazon but they lost of other places as well the Home Depot\nAnd various other people that took their their market share it's been around for a hundred and twenty five years I mean they had a real run at its peak the stock for example is a hundred and twenty dollars a share and two thousand seven down to panic though yeah so it it was one of the great American companies that just to keep up with the times\nWhat a what could have saved them stay say I don't know what's starting in the eighties maybe they were probably some critical decisions that were Mr maybe nineties\nI'm certainly going online much more aggressively a kick out the stores are keeping up with the latest fashions are competing more aggressively with the company is going after them whether it be Home Depot or clothing stores [noise] uh but it was it's a huge company that I have a lot of\nEmployees of the high cost base it would have been hard for them to survive this very brutal retail environment\nYou know what what are the thing about fears too is is that the fact that they anchor so many malls what about those malls now that they sort of live in fear\nI think so um and the stories of not popular anyway so they don't ask her but at the current issue\nThose places will be we developed\nA maybe from the store maybe for other purposes I mean those gems in restaurants all kinds of things that come into these places [noise] um so ... even Amazon Amazon starting to open stores though so that's purpose will be the space will be repurposed but it's got to be a big drag them a lot of them they currently have\nA total of about eight hundred and twenty stores both ears and Kmart and that they're going to close a hundred and fifty pretty soon\nThey're in chapter eleven reorganization but if they don't do well enough to the holidays is probably liquidate them off that's eight hundred and twenty large stores\nThat will be liquidated on the market including all their inventory\nAnd speak with Jordan Goodman personal finance experts at money answers dot com he's known as the America's money he answers man we're talking about the Sears bankruptcy filing how about the irony by the way of Amazon actually opening brick and mortar stores\nYeah well uh they're doing a very selective way they do these Amazon Go stores where you go in and they know who you are you just take things off the shelf they walk up I Know exactly what it says no cashiers whatsoever so\nAnd they're doing all the best of what Amazon offers its own products and so and so it is an irony but they're doing a much more strategic way a much more limited inventory in select locations fears just got too big and had too much of a jury and too many big stories of people didn't want to go to\nIf you're a savvy shopper are you preparing to pounce on what Sears may have to offer\n[noise] yeah I mean the products are good and and yes I think you're going to fail incredible prices for\nAppliances electronics clothes and all of his fears office yes I think people will go up there and clean the place out with them which is a tech sales away from other traditional retailers will probably have to compete maybe you'll see lower prices from Walmart and target and other places to compete with this huge liquidation from all the stores\nWill we still know the Sears brand than a year five years from now\nNot really I I it's not going to be around I mean some of the individual brands Kenmore for example ... fears about that for four hundred million dollars um they've got some brands but most of the brands have been sold out so I think the fears name itself is probably going to disappear over to our\nNext Jordan Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man\nIs more of a program\nIs brought to you by light stream if you have a balance on

extraordinary storm and uh it's very difficult on the ground\nI'm home served on schools here on business there on a power is still coming back a bet a lot of people are without\nUm communication towers came down there is still the bread and some of the road so it's\nA challenging environment and we're doing what ever we possibly can\nTo help people out um we have about Thirteen hundred volunteers in the affected area and they're twenty three shelters that are open about Fifteen hundred people living in them and there were ten thousand people AT T coil but we also have um\nAt Seventy five emergency response vehicles in their ... around the affected area and giving people hot meal and um water and lots of hug and so far we've already served about\nHundred twenty five thousand meals snack so it's a big operation um are volunteers here amazing I never\nUh never get used to have generous they are I just and he can make me\nAny feel for how long they'll be there at this point\nWell we cannot leave until the last person in a shelter it plays poker and of course we had um a number of people that are employees and volunteers that live in the impacted area because\nWe're in about three thousand counties across the country\nSo um they never leave they they don't pack up and go home because they are um and um yeah we\nWe just stay until people find a place you go to that point you people in shelters in the Carolinas from Hurricane Florence ... is that right yeah yeah\nAnd so you know this is a difficult period I I think generally speaking like stories now start not to get told right the media begins to pull away from affected areas as they start to focus on other breaking news uh does this become more difficult for the volunteers\n[noise] well um it becomes more difficult really for everyone um because\nUh you know we need health and we always need volunteers\nUm you know the the um Thirteen hundred volunteers that I talk about they work two or three weeks shit for\nUm twelve hours a day seven days a week so they go home we have to refreshed and like the volunteers so it can it it does become a bit discouraging when people think it then forgot and not only the IRS people impacted\nAnd of course everything the American Red Cross does\nIs because they can't ... the American public whether they're giving us financial gifts or\nA donating their time to volunteer and I'm sadly Gordon um we had to cancel a lot of blood ties between Hurricane Florence and hurricane Michael because a lot of them were scheduled in those areas\nAnd um we were looking at a bit of a blood shortage right now that we're also encouraging people to donate blood if they're willing to get the gift of life\n... speaking this morning with Gail McGovern president and CEO of the American Red Cross what's the what's the greatest need at this point is that the blood is it the more volunteers money\nUm yes yes and yeah I Know that um\nYou know what we're really focusing on is providing food shelter water um we're helping people figure out how to navigate through this you know some people\nJust barely got out of their home and that they need their a prescription and treat

whether Democrats will live up to expectations of winning back the house and can defy the odds to take control of the Senate but for some smoke signals about President Trump's reelection chances\nTo swing state governor races will offer tantalizing clues about the public's tolerance for progressive is when the alternative is electing Kennedy to emulate the attitude of the president so says Josh cross harp politics editor at National Journal Josh how do you see it\nWhen you want to look at how a twenty twenty presidential election might shape up\nIt's really instructive to look at the sort of laughter versus right governor's race is taking place in swing diverse backgrounds and I'm Talking about Florida\nGeorgia and even Arizona to a to a lesser extent where you have you know in in the in the Florida race you've got a Bernie Sanders candidate running against the Trump endorsed Republican it's a Florida is one of the most a bellwether state for the country and the rate is extremely close\nIf someone like Andrew Gillum ... will be the first African American governor Florida if if if if he win that race and he's a very progressive candidate\nHe would send a message to Democrats in twenty twenty book we can win the electoral college we can win the presidency with a very liberal candidate against against President Trump or there's a path with a victory even nominate someone who is a little bit outside the mainstream ...\nMm So is the same thing true in Georgia where you've got Stacey Adams running\nThe verbs yeah Julia is a a another great example where you have two candidates claimed to to the bases are ... you know and then the primary especially with talking about how she wanted to build a new coalition\nOf voters in Georgia and not just relying on sort of a swing\nAtlanta voter that off and make up the difference of course George election she wanted to get new are largely African American voters took a poll and create a new electorate or to help Democrats win the big bad for big gamble and she definitely has the windows are backing that good democratic year but she's running neck and neck with the Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp\nWho was again a Trump endorsed candidate someone who's very very conservative especially on social and cultural issues and uh you know there's also a big battle over over voting rights than in the state where I'm you know he he at secretary of state camp went after Abrams for something to organize and tried to get new voters registered to vote in the future so\nAgain this is a polarized electorate left versus right and that state that is the lead legal Republican but it's one of those days the Democrat but they can compete in in years to come\n... received Josh cross our politics editor at National Journal these pieces called battle of the bases will set the tone for twenty twenty you point out in the story too about the risk of running left\nYeah I mean the conventional wisdom and I I I buy the conventional wisdom is that when you go to carnival after going to alienate those swing moderate voters a typical it makes a difference in in competitive elections that Democrats are betting on it I I can understand why what what area of the cases\nThey think this is such a good democratic environment there's such a ... you know here's a guy called anger especially among suburban voters that it may not matter who Democrats nominate they might be able to nominate someone who is a little bit\nTo the left or by the suburban voters are so so uh you know\nHave such a problem with President Trump they look at the Republican Party and wonder where it's going and then they just straight Democratic Party ticket right when they vote on a strict party ticket and the Democrats so environment and if you want to have a candidate that's going to be a little more progressive than normal this is the type of political environment Democrats Woodward would a would achieve that goal\nThat gets to I Believe your point about this competing culture clashes you call it in the Trump era\nYeah I mean this is the middle of this or\nYou know the the time for a century the timer moderation is is that here and twenty teens which Trump is rallying his base Democrats are playing to the resistance\nI there's not much room for something like a like a ... brat as it was a former Democratic governor in Tennessee you're trying to run to the middle or he's finding that it's hard to the to the center of the people want to take sides on the left ...\nExplain what's happening in Arizona than that so somewhat similar maybe to Florida in Georgia\nYeah this is starting to see the Republican incumbent ... can't not as Trump be ... to ... to other Republican so it's a little bit different but again running against the uh his guy ... they would they would go see it will be the first Hispanic governor in Arizona and in over forty years\nAnd go see it again I'm especially immigration which is a very touchy issue in Arizona where voters are much more conservative on border security and migration issues\nAnd he's Josh Josh cross our politics editor at National Journal

well Brooklyn is number two followed by Raleigh Durham\nOrlando and Nashville in the top five like Orlando Tampa is and the tops and for the first time I'm Alice from Mitch Rochelle he's publisher of the forty a Daniel report in partner repeatable UC Mitch give his takeaways\nWell what's interesting is that cities that are hot for real estate investment in the year ahead\nAre smaller cities Dallas has on top of the list and the New York area Brooklyn which isn't too small a is number two but we have Raleigh Durham Orlando Nashville Austin\nA Boston Denver Charlotte and Tampa saint Pete which is near the top ten so the big trend that we're observing here Gordon that smaller cities are more interesting to real estate investors and the larger ones\nAnd why is that any reason\nIt's really it's sort of a combination of economic and demographics a German demographics perspective a younger folks are wanting to live there\nAnd that's the future for the employment base and then the economic side staying with employment employment base in those cities and to be very stable and growing she'll Racine growing population growing employment wearing a virtuous cycle in terms of people are willing to work there and what we're observing ... and the economy is lead\nSinger such a tight labor market with ... unemployment rate\nUh jobs ... people not the other way around show when jobs are chosen people to cities you find a lot of real estate investment opportunity that's what the common thread of cross virtually all of them\nSo you mentioned the younger folks looking at these smaller type cities is that because they might be more affordable in addition to having jobs\nYeah no question any sort of building Gordon extends not only to young people who want to work there and start careers and start families which also for double in terms of doing business many cities are considerably more affordable\nThan their big city counterparts and in terms of retirees are empty nesters some of them when they figure out where to move next but actually picking cities like lawsuits are not just young folks that are flocking to Austin believe it or not and some retirees as well\nInteresting

little version of last week actors are getting worse in terms of being a checkup\nWith something in that survey today that we wouldn't have seen years ago\nWell I think one thing is like touched on at the beginning of the segment which is the size of the city is getting smaller and years ago especially coming out of the last recession and we saw um big cities being the case but people want to invest in real estate because I've been ... now that were later in the cycle of people are trying to\nFocus on one of those markets that are really a growth potential\nThe other thing that I found very interesting is how\nOptimistic real estate investors continue to be about the prospects are investing in real estate the profitability of investing and a long term prospects for growth in the

Holmes the house Judiciary Committee here's Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard Eric what's up here\nRight now we've got a whole crush of people being called before congressional committees to testify about the FBI and the Jay's actions before the two thousand sixteen election\nThese are investigations that have been going on for a while but now all of a sudden there's a time pressure on getting people to come in and testify\nBefore those committees and it all comes down to the mid term elections which is there's an expectation that probably you know Republicans have a three out of for a chance of losing the ... the uh the house\nA majority this year and what they lose if they lose a majority of the crucial thing an investigation is it's up to the chairman of the house committee to issue subpoenas sort of on his or her own\nUm say so and so you you meet the subpoena power to force people to come in and talk\nTo give testimony and in the Senate the chairman of a Senate committee needs the agreement of the ranking member of the other party to issue a subpoena so you don't have the same kind of power and so even if the Republicans hold on to the\nSenate if they lose the house they really lose that power to force people to come in to testify\nWow so the current let's say investigations could they be shut down if Democrats take control or or the do the investigations have to see the way to the end\nOf the congressional investigations can turn on a dime I mean\nThey can be going along and be one day from coming out with their report conclusions and if the party changes than the power over what the majority puts out as a report changes immediately and show\n'em power of having a congressional um leadership both in the big picture and in each individual committee\nI'm really determines what that committee does it's it's not like with the inspector general's investigation which is going on he will keep going with his investigation regardless of who's in power and Congress\nOr speak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard he's written a piece titled how the midterms will affect Congress's investigations are what are the Democrats in the house said they'll probe if they gained the majority after November\nWell you know you've got in the house intelligence committee instead of Devin Nunes has you'll have it being run by Adam shifts and he's made it very clear that he will be\nI'm pursuing allegations of money laundering from the Trump Organization so that's what his focus will be and you'll have over in the house oversight committee I'm Alive Cummings will be in charge there\nAnd a Jerrold Nadler will take over the house Judiciary Committee those are the three committees that then primarily looking at a investigations a shift has made it clear that um\nIs money laundering investigation that he wants to launch we'll be focused specifically on Donald Trump and Russia so you can be pretty sure that on the house side\nThat any investigation into abuses by the FBI and the\nApartment of justice I'm with regard to investigating the Trump campaign during the two thousand sixteen election um those will disappear from the house side\nWould have Republicans hold the house then what happens\nUm then things keep going on and what will happen is the investigations I think will not only\nHave kind of new life but they'll have a new energy that will come from having been racing to get 'em ... witnesses before the committee's [laughter] you know the things had been moving along\nAt a store to steady pace with everything else going on in the house and so all of a sudden they have a lot more time at their disposal but they've done a bunch of\n'em raced to the finish interviews that'll put them in a

extend it happens at all it's a a threat to you know basic democracy and we have a system\nWorks where you can't have that that kind of anecdote happen at all everybody's got perfect privacy when they're in the voting booth\nPeople don't have perfect privacy when they're voting by mail so why would you want to switch from the voting booth to voting by mail the convenience factor to me does not

have a a good sense of self centered willing to stand up for themselves to\nSpeak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard I'm Still the ballot box is not always convenient is that the argument for the mail in ballots or this is it's an effort to get more participation\n[noise] well you know it's actually been an effort in in large part to get more participation because of making it convenient but in particular I'm making it\nMore convenient for liberal voters um this has been a quest by the left to get a ... vote by mail because so much of their effort to turn on turning out the vote\nAnd they can go and make sure everybody gets their mail in ballot and take a lot of times when when there's a polling on a given day at a given polling place there's only so many bands you can send out to get people to the part of the\nUm but vote by mail gives you the opportunity to get more usually I'm liberal constituencies to vote\nFor him to turn out the vote ... is more important to Democrats aren't there more registered democratic voters\n... turning out the vote one way or another generally helps um democratic candidates I'm part this is because a lot of what that would be um democratic candidates rely on our get out the vote effort\nUm and there's only so much you can do when there's one voting day but if you have a month or two months of voting by mail\nI'm available you can turn out a lot more of the voters who will be discouraged to vote by inconvenient so the more convenient you can make it more likely you are to get voters to turn out who are otherwise that

been using\n... you know to the point was Hillary has been making this excuse for why she lost and I kind of connected the dots with the vote by mail because it is she was not making the claim that

Strasse elite problem you know lots of lots of issues around they're they're scheduled on worker advocacy groups are definitely pushing for that um that it you know it's unclear if these policies can really solve all of workers scheduling problem\nOr just think I Wonder if some of them might complain they could to get robbed of overtime hours for example of something changed\nThat much of a concern but I just think that some of these laws are not really necessarily directed at\nThe end of the biggest pain point that employees that we come from talking to them in on one thing is that a lot of workers are worried about not getting enough hours on because you're making an hourly wage so if you're not getting enough hours you might not have enough money one week for your rent or your car or food\nAnd ... do try to get workers more our some of them have stipulation that say that employers have to go to current employees and offer them more hours before hiring additional employees\nUm it's unclear if I'm at the laws are really making a big difference in terms of total number of hours for workers\nRight so who who's doing what I Know you've given McDonald's McDonald's example\nThey talk to a McDonald's franchisee in Oregon on where these laws went into effect in July on and he talked about kind of how hard it's been for his store managers\nUm a lot of extra time for paperwork she has an all come to the head office now for a ... hour session where they make their schedules together\nOn a lot of stress in terms of what do I do if a worker calls out check um [noise]\nA lot of stress around what do I do if they get busy at the end of someone shift I used to just like kind of\n... and if they would stay and they would stay and I would pay them for that time but now if they stay more than a half hour over that's considered a schedule changed and I have to pay an additional the in addition to just their hourly wage it they would be earning [laughter] they're just a lot more for managers to think about\nOh we're speaking with Wall Street journal management reporter Rachel finds that she's got a piece titled new laws aimed to make work hours more predictable does the uh if some of these laws go into effect it does the size of the business matter the number of employees\nYes on there really aimed at bigger businesses so it depends on the law but a lot of them are like over five hundred employees or you have to have a certain number of locations in the United states so we're not really talking about small businesses here\nSo the status of some of them like you mentioned a New York city though the whole state of Oregon uh does does seem to have bipartisan support or is it not gotten that far yet\n[laughter] I mean we're definitely things crop up in the areas where we tend to see more progressive legislation especially workplace legislation pop up somewhere like Seattle where they've already had a big minimum wage crush on you know area that we're we're seeing kind of knew paid sick leave laws\nOn like I said New York Seattle San Francisco Emeryville, California\nUm these are definitely cropping up in and more kind of liberal outpost\nAnd then you you gave an example to of a gap that has gone through with this one I think experience maybe some growing pains but results have been favorable\nTo I mean there are a lot of companies that are just doing this of their own accord whether they see the writing on the wall that this legislation is coming whether they think it's the right thing to do for workers\nOn whether they think they're some on recruitment retention benefit for that and some companies are kind of coming out of this before the law intact to them and to tap\nOn had kind of a big pilot study where they implemented scheduling changes and all their stores and then try to that group that kind of went even further and they they did the positive result they saw an increase in sales and productivity\nOn and so yes like some of the growing pains that we see from the Donald franchisee for example you know hopefully that will ease with time and they're all you know people say there will be positive benefits for companies and for workers", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "01", "locations": [["America", 39.828306, -98.5795],
