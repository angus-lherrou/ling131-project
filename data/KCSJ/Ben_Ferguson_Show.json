kidnapping children\n\nHad an award speech honoring Colin Kaepernick\n\nBut we're supposed to but we're supposed to blame the president for his rhetoric and saying he used to blame for all of this\nJim Carrey literally at age ... all this is going on standing ovation material here folks reminded the crowd that he really despise as president Donald Trump\nKerry made his disdain for the president very clear over the past several months drawing cartoons of everything from something somebody you're in anything on the president's grave to a more recent drawing of bombs coming out of the president's mouth\n\nThat that's right that's this is this is Jim Carrey\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter Carrie delivered one of his most politically charged statements during his remarks at this

and you lie and you say if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor and that's cause if you like you're pointing keep your plan that false than you think politicians should be in trouble for that\nI absolutely I think\nThey are now to count her out of that is designed it right and then the counter side that has this\nUm and I get your point but then they would say\nWell what if you promise vote for me and I'm going to lower crime but then crime goes up three months later do you have to pay a fine for that you get my point I mean you and and and you'd have the politicians who would be the ones that would be directing the the the fines back and forth which also scares me if you'd weaponize those fine\nOh it certainly has to be in a similar to the IRS where that is non political\nWell remember the ... remember the iris when after a Tea Party groups in silence them and attack them\nThat's right that's absolutely appalling and that's\nThe lowest learner and don't

they're blaming Donald Trump for the bombs that were sent this week in the mail that did not explode thank goodness\nThey're even trying to tie the ah attack that happens at the synagogue to the

Donald Trump's fault\nAs the as the left and they they will not stop this I mean you look at this billionaire or who ran all these ads saying we need to impeach Trump impeach Trump impeach Trump he now says that Trump that has created the atmosphere for political violence saying it's it's really trumps fault people need to understand that this is actually\nAll Trump's fault\nThe President Trump in response to this horrific shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue issued a sweeping condemnation of violence in anti Semitism um do you are you satisfied with how he's responded to this tragedy\nRole I think his response to the tragedy is was appropriate but there's something much bigger than that going on here which is the atmosphere that he's created and if the Republican Party has created in terms of political violence\nAnd I think if you look across the political scene but you see is routine systematic lawlessness an attempt to break small D democratic norms\nIn pursuit of victory at all costs ... and we see it in voter suppression\nWe see it in extreme gerrymandering we see it in the violent political rhetoric of course that people have been alluding to all morning for more than that we see it in a president who doesn't ... who is been breaking the law systematically as a candidate as a business person and as a president\nSo a Republican would argue or you say that Tom but\nThere was a capital there was a shooting of a Republican members of Congress last year by a it seemed to Bernie Sanders supporter or what appear to be toxic substances or or folks toxic substances have been sent to\nDonald Trump junior and his family Senator Susan Collins that it's not just Republican lawlessness here what would you respond to that day\nI Would say there has been bad behavior on both sides but you can't find prominent Democrats elected officials who refused to condemn it you don't find prominent Democrats who are leading chance with violent overtones like lock her up CNN

House President Trump rode\nOn Thursday a Medicare or a significant change the Medicare when it comes to prescription drug pricing\nHaving a drug based on the price has paid and\nOther advanced industrial countries is a huge change that's going to save money for a not only the government which means us the tax payers end for millions of Medicare beneficiaries\nSo it's going to be a campaign issue and I want you to know what is true and what is not true and why this can be so good for so many Americans joining me now to talk about that a stream of Burma should a minister and for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services I appreciate you\nComing on tonight this was a significant move by the White House to lower drug prices for millions of Americans\nThat's exactly it and and let me just give you some background first so we were released a report yesterday as well and it can cost up our prices for the most costly position administered drugs that are covered by Medicare part B\nWhat it showed is that on average the United states is paying a hundred and eighty percent more and in some cases more than a four hundred percent more\nThan the international average so this means that the Medicare program and our beneficiaries are spending you know just a lot more than other countries have to pay for their drugs and\nI think that some of the issue with how the Medicare program is set up and the way we pay for drugs and part B which is a physician administered drugs are drugs that you get in the doctor's office is that we're essentially just a price taker there's absolutely\nNo negotiation that goes on and we don't get discounts and also the way we're paying doctors for this as well is that there's a perverse incentive for doctors because they actually get paid more if they are prescribing higher price drive\nAnd so what the president has said and he's been very committed to lowering drug prices and we've heard him talk about this and he's delivering on his promise and what we did is we put together a proposal\nAnd we want to hear comments on our proposal but the idea here is to essentially phase in\nUh the prices that are being offered overseas and face those in for our Medicare beneficiaries to that over a five year period our prices would drop on average by thirty percent so this would be savings to the taxpayer about Seventeen point two billion dollars\nAnd for Medicare beneficiaries it would be about three point four billion dollars\nAre gonna keep doctors whole we're just going to pay for drugs in a different way so that we take out that incentive\nUm to prescribe higher price drugs and we're just going to be paying them a flat rate essentially to administer these drugs but they are going to be kept whole\nThis is not going to impact patient access to medications in any way but what it will do for patience is lower their prices\nYou know one of the questions I Know I'm going to get to hear from people as well how was that the rest of the world is paying such a different price for these prescription drugs than we are and why did it take so long to to make this change\nYeah and that some of the the the way the Medicare program is set up and this is why I get very concerned when I hear calls for Medicare for all because the reality is there are just problems in the in the Medicare program today\nAnd it's it's what is written into law and essentially what it says is that we're going to pay the average sale price a six percent\nSo there's really no room for negotiation and because of that we're seeing prices go up and up um you know I can tell you from where I sit at my desk I'm staying price tags of almost a million dollars for some drugs that are coming out and so we ... we can't afford it and the worst part about it is that\nUh people overseas and other developed countries um are paying much lower prices and so it's time\nUh that America not be paying for innovation and for the entire world and that the the rest of the world also a contributing to the cost of innovation and drug development and it's it's it's time that we stopped Americans being taken advantage of\nMy guess would be same of Irma she is the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services I've met so many people to hear the word change they get nervous they think grabbed to sign up for this drive to change something\nOr is this going to be automatic for people in Medicaid\nIt is automatic for patients it should really be absolutely seamless are not going to feel any change except for when it comes time to open up their wallets and pay the bell and that's when they'll feel the difference there they don't need to sign up for anything there are most people are already paying their part B premiums\nAnd so what we hope to see happen is that they're going to see lower prices at the pharmacy counter and you know over time this could impact their premiums and they can see those go down as well but it doesn't take a than taking any active steps\n... this was a obviously huge information for so many millions of Americans are on Medicare and Medicaid services or the deal with those things that's when the president did this on Thursday if people want to get more information about this uh we're can they go to find out more\nThat's exactly it you can find more information at

country she says people using free speech is the shield to hurt people is not America\nTook him took him literally three seconds every started talking to blame the president\nYou know well he got it right but there's a bigger thing happening here which is the president United States of America this is what he's doing okay I I go back to what I said in that there's just proof of it right there\nYou want to know what the midterms about everything is the president's fault that as a strategy the Democrats in the midterms\nYou have a horrific anti Semitic shooting that takes place clearly the president loves people that are Jewish his own daughter a convert to Judaism his son in law is Jewish or his in laws are Jewish I mean this is a man that that is loves Jewish people but it's his fault they were just shooting\nIt's it's it's actually his fault this is a guy who divided the country and I'll say it again if you support the president nine states of America\nAnd you stand behind them and you're proud I Want you to share but now if you disagree with them and when you're at the angry face you're watching it on Facebook Live and I want to get your phone calls from all over the country one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to the Patriot mode I count phone lines are open now that's not all the time had to say\nSo he implies that well this is basically Donald Trump's fault that we have the shooting a synagogue and then listen to what he says\nAnd I think if you look across the political scene what you see is routine systematic lawlessness an attempt to break small D democratic norms\nIn pursuit of victory at all costs and we see it in voter suppression we see it in extreme gerrymandering we see it in the violent political rhetoric of course that people have been alluding to all morning\nI mean there's so many records you says lawlessness okay so the lawless and so many of the street you have a president Donald Trump that wants to secure the border and doesn't want to care available to break into this country\nYou didn't say that the president's kidnapping these children is the words of Jim Carrey you didn't come out and say that this is the party of lawlessness which is actually advocating for law and order\nDonald Trump is advocating for law and order easy law and order candidate he's advocating for there to be structure in our laws he's advocating for there to be a people not voting illegally and illegal immigrants not signing up to vote in places like California illegally and able to vote in local elections when they're not even a citizen\n\nAnd you want to say this is an issue of lawlessness that this the president is advocating for lawlessness and when he does advocate for the last to be enforced like securing our border you didn't say that he's he's a big it is a racist\nHe's an evil person because he's not letting people break into this country you just said you didn't want lawlessness and then you advocate for a while as soon as all week long by advocating for people coming into this country doing this in a ... and a way that this law last\n\nEight hundred for seven for nine seven three to you know I don't believe that the president at fault and I'll give you an example\nI don't think that because somebody sends bombs in the mail this week and and was a Trump supporter that that's the president's fault the same way\nThat the Utah man that was charged for sending toxic letters to Trump and other administration officials I don't believe that it's the fault of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer Hillary Clinton Rocco bomber Eric Holder\nBy the way this is what the media was not focused on this week so I'll tell you the story because they were only focus on somebody that was a Trump supporter sending pipe bombs and didn't explode thank goodness and they completely didn't talk about another man who did something very close to this\nAnd his political motivations because it didn't fit their narrative federal authorities\nSecurity the indictment on Thursday against the man accused of sending threatening letters to top U.S officials including a rice

we'll come back and has it been Ferguson show nice to have you with us tonight if you just joined us we're shouting right now [noise] about Democrats coming after Donald Trump Jim Carrey now the actor this weekend said that a Republican\nOr Donald Trump is now kidnapping kids the same people that are saying uh then we need to make sure we need to make sure that we bring people together to unify the country then they go out and said Donald Trump is kidnapping children\nThat sound like unification not so much doesn't sound like unification Adel\nDo as I say now is I Do Democrats want to blame Donald Trump for the crazy man that went out there and did horrible things this week by sending bombs that people but they don't cover the undercover the liberal man who sent rights and to the president rice in to the FBI Director rice and to the secretary of defense\nDouble standard they didn't say well should we hold Democrats accountable for what was said nope won't say worried about that\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to let me go to Mike thanks for wedding Mike you're on the bench burgers and show good to have you with us right go ahead\nA yet regardless of response of regardless of a whole is yet I was saying a lot of what side I think the the the point that telling a called very clear is that if you answer correct that justified whatever went down there\nI think that is the wrong approach regardless of who said but I Do agree on one thing is that forty five that's\nWhat they did a lot of people get fired up and art faking it beyond a thought or a you know just verbal\nThing and to\nWhat we're seeing I think needs to recreate the responsible what I Am saying is that we cannot deny the fact\nThat words have power\nAnd they do translate to actions in some instances where\nYou were here here's my thing why is it that no one has brought up the actual violence it's been done by Democrats when they surrounded by congressman I end up fighting I Am\nNot well let me just let me ask you let me just ask you a quick question if you look you look at the Democrat to surrounded the table or the Senate majority leader and through his food out in the street in Kentucky you you look at them they surround the table if Ted Cruz get right up and Ted Cruz face screaming and him were asked to lead the restaurants around his wife\nOr you didn't see any of the Democrats are being forced to denounce sat right the media wasn't interfaces go Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer you denounce the way the Republicans are being treated\nNo 'cause that's not a story they want to cover there is a double standard here I Would love for all of this to clean up I Would love for all of it but remember this is the same\nGod it's on TV saying in peach\nYou know\nPizza president sign up with me and pizza president sign up with me I'm running multimillion dollar adds impeached president because I don't like the president that is a big problem\nThat's the part might that irritates me than\nI Am saying that you know regardless what we say things and they'll expect people to say you know that justifying what why why why not just because we\nHave a a reasonable explanation or answered correctly that it's not right I think I think that is very offensive to the people and this is that what we say that word\nYet I'll have a way of explaining and just\nLet me let me let me break it down let me break it down even more just blatantly All right I I'm assuming you're not a big fan of the president\nI I Am a big fan of justice at liberty or oh\nOkay are you didn't answer you didn't answer my question they look at some of it's not a trick question is asked you\nYou're not a big fan you're not if you're not a big fan of president right\nWell let me put it to you this way I Am a big fan of justice\nAnd the little duck with the same thing I'll just said that's exactly the same thing you just said so I'm going to ask you a third time it is not a trick question and I think it's a simple question right now or you're not you're not a fan of the president\nRight you're not a fan of the president right\nI Can't see you want to justify as\nWell I'm not I'm not justifying anything I'm just asking a question Mike if I had a trick question\nThey go see at one point the finger man\nThat I'm not one of the finger I ask you a question the question was are you are you not a fan of the predator\nAnd how he says that\nOkay I'm going to move on because you're just I I mean I I I gave you a fair shot their answer a basic question it's not a tough question to answer\nMy question I was going to ask you following up to that wasn't as we have the audio already the president responding to shooting at the synagogue do we All right what's what's play that because my question was going to ask you was is the tone of the president of the shooting at the synagogue not spot on exactly what you want from a president listens Donald Trump\n[noise] some [noise]\nI'm On I'm On my hot [noise]\nWell again the\nDo with it if you take a look if they had protection inside as a result would have been far better the views that will always exist I suspect but\nSome kind of a protection inside the temple\nOr maybe you could have been a very much different situations they did that he was able to do things and unfortunately he shouldn't have been able to do I hear the police were outstanding hired the belief that an incredible job it is you know\nWere badly injured [noise] but uh again law enforcement that have been testing job\nNow I mean just just start with that right there they tried to turn this into an anti gun thing they literally\nTried to turn in danger I'd gotten near the media is it is about the gun laws it's about the gun laws we don't know anything about that we don't know anything about the gun laws in this and I mean where they're grandmas broken whether we found I think they were the guns were actually bought\nBut let's\nThe gun let's not talk about this president I mean are you not going to call for gun laws right now because of a shooting that's

people are coming to take care of it we don't know the ... we haven't had any real\nData or information to say these people are here trying to do this just to do a political stunt or they're actually come to the country because they're trying to get up on them all up there trying to go out with all the countries where the law is is so far behind\nWhat we can be recovered handle on it so I mean you almost have to understand why they're real and take the risk\nWell I doubt they're willing to take the risk but I also think that if we do allow people into this country then you're in that what you're doing is I think you're incentivizing people to take these risks that could cost in their lives and their kids' lives\nYou know there may be some security in the numbers of how many people were there right there may be some security\nIn the press sit there that's following them a ... and for the stability that comes with people supporting them along the way because this caravan is a caravan that's being followed by the international press they're all following them they are all telling their stories they're all trying to make you feel sorry for somebody\nI mean that that's something that they are clearly trying to do\nA ... they're trying to humanize and to basically make you feel like there's no way you could say no there's no way that you could say\nA this is wrong you know that that that that you know you're you're somehow evil if you say I want you to be able to do it the right way or you should be doing it the right way and and so if you do let them all and then what does that say the rest of the world it's going to you're going to have a lot of people that probably be be taken advantage of by coyotes\nPeople that may lose their lives you have to\nI Believe you must\nRespond\nWhen clearly showing that this is not how we work in this country so don't take the risk don't take the journey don't take the track because if you do you are wasting your time\nBut the thing of it is a lot of those people are on education they don't they don't even\nKnow what they're coming into they do not even know that there's a possibility that can be military force when they hit the border that they're going to be deported immediately that they may be sent back to the countries where they could be I mean as far as we know that could be murder for going back to their own countries\nWe don't know yeah the whole situation and you know me personally I Know people who come here illegally from El Salvador while I'm all it is bad I mean what they do their children what the government does to their children what government people in employees\nAnd please do I have no ... it's what I said before I have no doubt that if I was poor and living in one of those impoverished countries that I wouldn't want out\nI have no ... you know you could argue that their conditions while traveling this country are probably on par with the conditions they live then if they stay in their homes for their or their hearts or whatever it may be where they're coming from\nRight because it's so bad I I don't think it's much worse on the road for them so it doesn't seem to be so there you know us doing this you'd say there's no way I'm going to go walk two thousand five hundred I don't I don't think we\nShould open our doors and say you know everybody just come on and and we're going to be free everything now first off I like to know who who's give me that data that they go right on welfare because I've lived in South west Missouri and central Kansas and\nYou know they have children legally born in the U.S they are us citizens I don't like you have a problem with that right but and us taking care of the citizens but the parents they get nothing\nThe kids you know yeah we put them in school and we give them that little two dollar lunch when they're in school but my go home they have nothing the parents what worked the\nJunkiest jobs they can get because they can't get regular jobs because they weren't so dirty numbers you know you got got give you their hats off to them because they're willing to put up with our beach\nAs far as way of life but to them it's better than going back to what they came from\nAnd I I Will say a lot of ... ... ... and ... their ...\nNo let me get the point out real quick I Know that there's people who thought they were trying to do it legal trying to go to a a a a immigration attorney and pay him or her thousands of dollars and got taken advantage of by because they weren't even legal attorney but there are so\nLow that there's always there's always people David out there that can be swindle you and I know that and that's unfortunate but that again is not my problem what we should have is consistency ... world ... word

five nine seven three to five three five nine seven three to the eight hundred number one eight hundred and four seven\nIt should've been at least fifty percent done the ... the Republicans have dropped the ball on this did not fight hard enough for this as they should have ... that's the end and look I don't know if the Republicans will build this wall but I can tell you what happens with the Democrats win in the midterms I knew everything they do have a full blown open border\nYeah for sure oh they don't please don't talk about the ah the\nCities where they housed all these legal or you know that they are I'm Sorry they have lost control of what a decent seat is of what the last in this country are at which they have to really spent did they nearly understand that if they will do whatever it takes to remain in power\nAnd you'll do leave the Democrats but some of the Republican and that we use that they don't care really about us\nYou know the the the people that have worked in this country are still working in this country and have made this country great and capitalism is what made this country great they they thought that they have socialism under control I come from that

I'm about an issue that is um you know these migrants they keep calling them come in this country this is political do not buy into the idea that it's not political it is\nAbsolutely political every part everything about this political every part of this is political everything that's going on with this is political everybody needs to understand that it's political everybody needs to comprehend that this is\nPolitical\nThey're hoping that this is going to be a disaster they're hoping that this is going to blow up in our faces they are hoping that this is going to be something where people are going to sit there and go oh my gosh\n\nI Can't believe this is happening oh my gosh I cannot believe that this is going down all my gosh look at how the Republican Party is training Donald Trump sent the military to the border that is so unfair\nThey should have never done that how terrible them to do that how awful it if they did that everybody should be ashamed that this happened that's what they're hoping for\n\nSo let's get to your phone calls on this and see what you think the number one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to Paul in Alaska you're on the bench Ferguson Sharon nice to have is nice to have you want to St Paul go ahead\nI think you can you hear me okay can hear you just fine sir rate\nWell first of all ah we're we're going to take issue as equals three of your points but\nBefore we go there I Want to see this\nGod list Donald Trump and those people who love them as our president has agreed American United States and then ... and I'm white right level seven forge less eager to know I like your show in coal into contributed pending 'cause I like what you're doing\nThat so even if we disagreed who's you know thank you for your show\nSo here's where we go we're letting everything you've said right correct they're setting this up as a political event but the truth is they're doing this because our leaders are letting them framed the narrative this is not a care of the head of illegal immigrants\nThis is an invasion of it is a new age invasion with cosponsors those cosponsors need to be painted [noise]\nThey need to be published so we can see what's happening this is the same thing as an insect world this is not complicated is not conflicts\nPeople in this United States are desperate because our country is split up because they've lost their moral foundations and their mission is a great country those people that hate Donald Trump here's what you have those people who have no place to go because you said for so long enough the public trough\nDid they know they have no place to go there now doing acts of desperation this this in the illegal invasion coming into our country is being sponsored\nI Would think that research or a reporter will be done in a heartbeat trailing all it from the ... one more thing\nWell I mean the logistics of this the logistics of this are clear I mean there there are so many people that are clearly invested in the logistics of this caravan ... they're they're willing to go two thousand miles they know they're going to be taken care of\nThere's obviously a schedule when it comes to logistics because the media is clearly sleeping somewhere every night and it's on the side of the road\nThe media is following this and all the major media groups or they're following this the entire way\nRight but but the point is you have to have accountability and you have to have rational or you have to pay the price for your actions and right now we're not to live for example or store just a minute ago the unions say damn will better be recording these phone calls these foreign countries or ... with some of our people\nTo break us as a country we all we can get to speak for three weeks the logistics of eastern person crosses the border the monetary impact our children\nHow can these people go their neighbor to say look I think you're chose not deserving but I think the one in Puerto Rico or Mexico or one of the many many central South American countries does deserve it so what's happening is the fruits of our labor of being evil and sent out to a foreign country\nSo that they can break the law to support those people here in my up in Newark traders so as long as you use terms like a Caribbean your leg them framed the narrative\nThese people think of I don't want to repeat myself but the point is do we invade Mexico\nDo we invaded so central and South America\nI don't I don't think here's what I'm saying I don't think we invade I don't think anybody has the stomach or the appetite for that I Do think if you don't need isn't the only ... I heard you out of her job problem let me finish I don't think we invade anything\nI I don't think there's a appetite to invade I don't think we should do that um I think what we should do is we should defend our border I don't think this is about the last thing I'm\nGoing after somebody I think this is about protecting your board and that's the reason why I think the president has ITS America showed a realistic response by saying\nAnd this is an important thing by saying that we would he would send the military to the border to protect\nThis country if he needs to and that is vitally important one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to let me go to Paul in California\nPaul you in California we've seen what happens round two of this uh illegal immigration I mean you have Democrats out there that are not only advocating for illegal immigrants to vote but wanting them to vote in state and local elections\nCorrect on what school cell phone with ... children that don't speak English\nAnd they're sucking up all the tax dollars and I'd like to say that the Mexican government is complicit I've travelled extensively throughout Mexico I'm aware of their passport laws and their ...\nWhy don't some hundred Americans probably marching south and see how far they get that will be put in jail by the time to get to the twenty kilometer mark\n... I wouldn't be I mean you go if you started care of and you go to Mexico and I guarantee you are going to be stopped by the Mexican government there's absolutely no way that you wouldn't be\nOn both sides once these guys get up to the border all they have to do is put one foot over the border and lay down its whole political a fire them\n... and they know that that's why they do it\nYou know some stormy there they can't read 'em up because I have to end up on the nightly news\nWell you you and I both know that this is how this works I mean everybody knows this this is this is how it works on average everybody everybody knows this is what you do this is how it works this is how you exploit the system and if you support the system this way it works out great\nGod Bless Donald Trump\nI think there's a lot of people behind them Paul God Bless you you guys could look in California because it's pretty disgusting what's happening in that state right now Scott you are actually out on Scott I hit the wrong button Jay in South Carolina you're on the bench Ferguson show Hi Jay go ahead", "show_name": "Ben Ferguson Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "22", "locations": [["El Salvador", 13.83333, -88.91667], ["South west Missouri", 36.51258, -94.61133], ["Kansas", 39.09973, -94.57857], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Ferguson", -54.78333, -35.83333], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Saudi Arabia's", 29.04234, 35.59259], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["US", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["South Carolina", 34.00071, -81.03481], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Cuba", 22.0, -79.5], ["Italy", 42.83333, 12.83333], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Beatles", 31.111, -83.79808], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Us", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Hernandez", 19.62748, -70.27772], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the U.

issue is losing filing against a week from a purely football standpoint\nI don't think the guy wasn't on a team because then when the football skilled in the form of pro ball there he is an absolute leader I think Caroline and got better no secondary by by the\nCurrent [noise] All right well Caroline is trying to keep pace in the in the south about things and one is we're just looking to stay alive as they head to Pittsburgh satin material is tied for second most is\nHe's one of the few survivors in Atlanta things are\nGoing to solve this problem is simply the\nThey couldn't use read I I mean the man up is the right thing to say it but in reality to soften test carry this group so hopefully they get beyond Jones in San Antonio\nBy [noise] All right but ... says he respects bin Laden was burger but he wasn't afraid to move back to sleep in\nBed hadn't seen me yet and all of us are about that you use the hall of famer Phil fan because a lot of Britain Myers landed a one on one interview process burger you might be facing his toughest task of the Fifteen Years he's playing the NFL he's trying the same ... hello Britain\n[noise] hey Kurt good to talk of lovable even my family does would use that term were with me but I can tell you that that that is not in love with his team's record after a month into the season he did say that he has more control of this deal are all bets on the way that he's ever had\nOver the decade the happier in Pittsburgh attacked as recently as friday he put in a new player new formation of a different personnel hoarding series of new place he hopes will help today no way beyond bell slight disconnect with Antonio Brown would have been worried about this team he's not showing [noise]\nAnybody right now\nWe describe the Steelers are desperate team ready no no no no for games in early in the season we need to have a sense of urgency but not desperate and after the most recently lost with Baltimore the quote you said I'm not playing well it has put a lot of blame on again when you're not with a ball game doesn't matter I think\nThe question is our ab and I know what's going on where's the connection\nDes Moines is I just haven't played well\nAs far as the double still every single plane if I can get him off\nTo a ball where he can catch a run the Margaret\nBe on bill from the outside we watch the the impact does represent what it's been like not having them early on it was definitely there are a lot of questions not know what's going on but once we mostly wasn't here we just had to move on if Belgium and the reports to the team do you accept it with open arms\nYeah we just don't know what it's going to be you know there's been a lot of reports of rumors can this team go to the playoffs without\nYeah absolutely you know they weren't very good football team I think he helped our chances\nLater mama we saw Gerald but going on how much I guess he tackled you\nAbout the run through the past year your bingo you're a tough guy you make plays and\nUh do you get the same benefit as ... as the smaller lighter not use this year actually it was the first dog gotten any calls that still banned so much a part of of your game right is hanging in there until the very last moment using your size and then leaning on your arms that kind of the bottom line we walk up\nOr not want interrupt the blow dead because nobody big plays of happen kind of in that last minute mode\nOver the years the great defense or the Steelers that was that was kind of a ... a lynchpin for this franchise really the last decade or so it's been more about on the office are you comfortable\nI don't know that all the fans are ... you know they still they still believe that defense but you know the the league is kind of change right Peter putting up thirty forty points almost regularly now so you have to\nWith the Joneses and they're trying to score\nThe porches you can I Know it's hard to say now what would have to happen for this Steeler seemed to contempt for the super bowl this year when just when when one game we started the the bad\nThe way you want to start a but but really just take one give us on not look ahead we can't look to the playoffs we can't we can't answer that question how do you get to the playoffs it how do we wouldn't want\nSay to turn it around you can lean on the great history of the Steelers but you can't rely on it as far as getting the ball the brown Antonio put it best when he phrased it as like live five you know sometimes the connection is more sometimes the connection is great but you always connected to expect to have a big game today\nAgainst the beat up thousands detest so as we throw it back we go from lifeline to a guy he was still listen to music at high fine Terry Bradshaw I take it away\nThat wasn't a shot I didn't take it as a shot at all I\nOut that I I Can't talk to talk about this football game it reminds me how he like an MBA all star game yeah everybody shows up and they say look forget the deep I Know deep in the day everybody would score are going to be fifty points bites\nSo no defense today and I guess whoever does have some defense late in the in the fourth quarter probably win the football game\nSurprised of all the teams\nThe history of the Steelers has always been what\nThe the better ever since Nineteen Seventy\nNow it's so hard for me to adjust to op ed fun\nYou get you get a what that kid tightened McDonald's tied in love this kid big powerful guy got to be a lot of fun watching this football game but I think of it as kind of like an MBA all star\nGame yeah is gonna be a lot of fun but you know both teams are desperate then they've got one when as you ought to be even more desperation after today for somebody you know and you talk about the things that you're giving up twenty nine points you came here you can't\nYou can't go that way you can't win a championship that way well they'd let us not any better you know they're just as bad on defense I think they put a little bit of a band aid on his day out\nOn the positive side he's putting up numbers that are comparable to his MVP season two years ago I think he liked it up\nToday in Atlanta missing beyond ... out of Neal ethic that I've heard them be spent the off miserably they get democracy Freeman\nBack which is going to be a big thing for them to go to not only in the running game but also in ... catching the ball\nOut of the ... he created metro problem but it is still a shame that they only have one way with all this talent\nOn often do you have Jones is a new one now really come in with sticks are found that ... I mean really may have all that counted but on the other side of the ball and Pittsburgh in your band and you're going into new round was already talking about I'm not catching a ball enough if Matt Ryan is making great connection with his receivers\nTony ... brown will be looking at been like um it's competitive here I Need to do what they're doing told me the ball\nTo how it before I went to go to the beginning of the AFC you've got Jacksonville the number one defense against Kansas City has got the number one scoring often slip by Patrick well today\nThis officers dynamic with by Patrick homes or the defense athleticism speed talent at every level this is by far I think his greatest challenge today holds\nAn interesting guy in his early in the second year he's not a gimmick is not a a guy that defense you're going to be able to figure out he's there for the long haul or he's the real deal I think he's the combination of for Rogers and you see some Russell Wilson\nYeah in fact yeah there you don't want me out there in a while but yeah yeah yeah I think he had written a why he's great he's going to be great for a long time [laughter]\nYou look like you're waiting to say something\nOr was it it passed a home related to Patrick my home small them\nOkay it's my own poll where we find these guys are going to cost you have to deal with one another early but also wrong

yeah I think because you have such a high base rate on that or an you said that this isn't a tax privilege to count which means you're not even paying taxes at this time I think I Would hold on I

about subjects financial let's get down to the mighty WLS Chicago John it's your turn welcome\nHi, Bob I really appreciate taking my call all of this as fast as I can 'cause I Know your time is precious [noise]\nUm my IRA is fully funded one hundred percent in the vanguard twenty twenty target date funds and so is my wife and her and her work her four oh one K. is funded in what\nThey call the vanguard twenty twenty trust fund which is exactly the same product as the uh twenty twenty target date fund and our I erase the only difference is\nThe twenty twenty target date fund in our air IRAs is about thirty two boxes share and her four oh one K. find it's about fifty five dollars a share so I was wondering um does that make sense for her to do a in service roll over\nTo hurt a higher rate in order to get more bang for her book or almost double the amount of shares\nJohn I'm really glad you called them but I I really have to ask you what in the world are we talking about let's think this through now you just pointed out in you\n\n\nJohn I'm really glad you called but I I really have to ask you what in the world\nAre we talking about let's think this through now you just pointed out in your comments that these two funds or do they have a different share price they are identical in terms of what they own is that correct\nThat is correct All right well therefore tell me if I'm wrong if the assets in that particular ... are holding go up a hundred percent the way I see it\nBut I've seen a hundred thousand dollars into the thirty two dollar per share side of it and and fifty five dollars per share your you're able to buy double the amount of shares in my life thinking incorrect here\nIn my opinion a yes or you're all caught off you're caught off base and tagged out for all in the stadium to see and I'll tell you why I say that are as you make your way as you make your way back to the dugout\nI'll tell you why I say that because if you put one and you tell me if you think I'm wrong\nOr if you put one hundred thousand dollars into the thirty two dollars shares and holdings in those shares double the securities in represented by those shares double than that one hundred thousand will be worth two hundred thousand\nAnd at the same time and the other fund which is invested identical early\nThose that by those shares at fifty five will have one hundred ten dollars shares which means they're one hundred thousand dollars will also have doubled the two hundred thousand dollars we're talking apples and Apple's\nOkay I I really appreciate that can I ask you one follow up question\nSure though I race we recently moved all these find all the smaller IRA money I asked her four oh one K. money from a very diversified a plan to these target date funds because we want to retire in three years\nSo we wanted to or reduce her risk in the market and get a bigger exposure to bonds\nAnd the the ratio and no shares are about fifty five percent stacks forty five percent bonds\nAnd we figured we do that for the next three years until we retire and then maybe evaluate our situation at that point maybe going to manage payout fund or something different or do you have any problem with that new allocation\nGoing to a fifty five forty five allocation anticipating a retirement situation as early as three years from now is not something that would cause me a problem and John I Do appreciate\nThe call always great to hear from our listeners in the windy city and throughout the mid west on the mighty WLS radio\nAnd for those of you that are just tuning in

an\nAmerican church uh and that was overshadowed because of the bombings for most of the country has a week where people are asking the question who's to blame we love to blame people for things that happen instead of blaming the individual we want to blame somebody else\nAnd I think it's unfair to just automatically assume that you can figure out why people like this do things like this when I say it's unfair it's because I don't think you can simply just say oh\nThis is that person's fault\nPeople tried to blend the bombing on Donald Trump saying well this is Donald Trump's rhetoric and it's all his faults and if he was if he wouldn't have irrational things up so much in tone things down this would have never been said this way it would have never been happier never would have been talked about this way never would have happened\nThis is his fault\nRemember Democrats ratchet up the rhetoric about Donald Trump sang impeach forty five and yelling at him and screaming at him and and their followers have become violent\nAt protests and events against conservatives you're I think that that they are to blame for the shooting of Congress men that were practicing for charity baseball game no because I don't think\nThat a person that clearly is crazy enough to do something like this is an individual is that you can hold an entire party or a president accountable for the actions of them by the way they're adults\nWe're talking about adults here older people here\n\nPeople you whether whether you were you know liking a political ... or not you know that is what you're doing is wrong\nAnd we see this happen and people say we're seeing more and more of this descending down ... synagogue mass shooting has a great example\nOf this well look at the man's online profile look what he was doing online if there's anything that inspired him it's the fact that he was able to connect\nVirtually to a community of people that believe the same things that he believes\n\nAnd they inspired one another they ... it's the same reason why we've seen so many people to be able to have been radicalized in such a short period of time\nBecause of the Internet with ISIS and al ... and Boko Haram and others I mean we see these ISIS inspired attacks where we have people that aren't that never even been to an ISIS camp or in our ... camp\nThey're trained literally over and radicalized over the Internet\n\nIs a cause and effect there's great things that come with the Internet there also the scary thing is is you\nYou can literally go out there and you can find a group of people somewhere in the world did agree ... and the things that you believe in as crazy as they are and then in doctrine eight you in them or inspire you or support you or encourage you\nWhether it is being anti Semitic whether it's being racist whether it's being a terrorist or without kind of ISIS or Boko Haram the list goes on and on\nMe you you look at Donald Trump's remarks or this weekend he condemned the the the vial hate filled anti Semitism after this shooting\nPresident Trump fiercely condemned it in response to the mass shooting\nThis was an anti Semitic at Trump's in response to the reports of eleven deaths at the tree of life sent a guy you wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we never seemed to learn from the past\nThe president invited a pastor and a rabbi to offer a prayer at the beginning of his speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indiana\nHe said anti Semitism and the widespread persecution of Jews represents one of the ugliest and dark is features of human history\n\nTrump also talked about this event occurred at a baby naming ceremony at the synagogue on the Jewish Sabbath day the gum and reportedly shouted all Jews must die after being in the synagogue\n\nTrump said that anti Semitism should never be tolerated in America saying the vial hatred it filled poison of anti Semitism must be condemn it confront an everywhere and and anywhere it happen everywhere and anywhere and happens\nYou know I I I\nI'm waiting for someone to say oh this is the fault of Trump or this is the fault of so and so why can't it be the fault of the individual\nWhy is it that we are so obsessed why are they so obsessed with blaming someone\nAlways blaming someone\n\nHave to go and use it for political purposes to blame someone else\n\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two we'll get your phone calls in here the patriots without comes under oath and let me go to Ben you are on the bench for August and she'll go ahead\n[noise] [noise] ... yeah I was just thinking about it and one of the things that I was looking at well watched Trump would kind of tone it down just a little bit of when you look at somebody that's about to commit suicide or shop off a building or whatever you just don't go by there and I'm like man jumped ran jumped because\nEven though it's still that person's fault for going ahead and jumping when you go ahead and continue to push people a lot of times they go ahead and do it\nAnd just to some of his rhetoric that he's been using and saying you have a lot of wind individuals that are just like the person that thinks about jumping off a building\nAnd it's just bad if I had a job you know got got you and that's not the right thing to do and so what what I Hope he will start doing in real life and even with what's going on this week\nIt's a start telling it completely down and we all need a talented elements that are are

was about four or five thousand is what they thought now it is staggering how much bigger this group has swelled up well beyond the five thousand they're vowing to reach the United states America this is something that many of actually said that they're trying to\nGet this journey to the ride around election day to make Republicans and Donald Trump look\nLike they're terrible people where they'll show up right before the election\nAnd\nThey will show up right before the election and when they do show up right before the election and we turn them away or we arrest people then they're going to exploit that for political gain in the mid term elections\nNow\nI'll get your phone calls on this and see what you think ah I don't believe that this is traditional seeking asylum I Do believe that there are some sad stories in this group\nI don't think that you should be able to come into this country illegally\nI think when you get into care of and the swelling the way this caravan is swelling I start to have some serious questions with your motives I have some serious questions about the politics behind this you know that you're breaking the laws and you continue to move forward and you can ... can continue to do it I have some real problems with that as well\nSo let me go to your phone calls and see what you think about all of this the number one eight hundred\nFor seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred\nFor seven for nine seven three to the Patriot mobile dot com phone lines are open or get your thoughts your reaction to this simple question is\nDo you believe that these individuals should be given asylum in this country the arguments 'til after saying is that any person that's willing to make this type of trek\nAny person who's willing to make this type of uh of effort to get here clearly is desperate and seeking asylum and therefore deserves it now I also do not believe that this was anything but a political ... move by many involved many that are supporting this\nUm group of illegal immigrants are heading towards this country and they want this to be synchronized with the mid term elections I'm telling you right now this is all about the mid term elections make no mistake about it it is about\nThe mid term elections and everybody needs to understand that\nI don't believe that this has anything to do with truly wanting asylum are seeking asylum in general most people would not do it this way why would you getting a massive caravan that you know it was on national news you know is already being stopped\nBy Mexico on this bridge for two days and keep coming the chances of being successful are very slim and it's being cruel yearly stated that the chances are ... America's saying you turn around we're not letting you in\n\nThat's what America's saying America's sang turnaround we're not going to let you in\nThey know this\nThey know that America is saying we're not letting you in\nMexico as even pretty much made that clear to them that look where America is not going to let you in so then it's Mexico's problem I guess at that point but I don't think this is about coming into America as much as it is about the PR nightmare that's what I honestly think I think this is honestly uh the the night mayor\nOf uh the PR nightmare that this will put and maybe it would change the elections and I think that's why a lot of people are inspired to actually be involved in this they're inspired to be involved in it because they think All right this could change the election America and then maybe I Will get asylum\nMaybe if I if we change the election then we can get the is the the asylum that we want\nThen maybe we'll get exactly what we want one eight hundred four seven\nFour nine seven three two and they keep saying that these are refugees I'm going to stop saying that the restaurant I I'm going to call it what it is a group of illegal immigrants that looks to be ten thousand strong and growing\nThat is what this actually is this is a group of illegal immigrants that is coming to America to break into our country illegally\nThat is what this is everybody needs to understand that that is what this is one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two and should the military be used once they get there if they're going to try to cross\nPeople said the military is not the way to do this to be a humanitarian effort\nThat we should allow liberals and liberal groups that go to the border and care for these people they shouldn't be worried about being a you know a salted I've even seen by the U.S military and who said the military is going to salt in the military because they know sorry you can't come in this country\nI Do believe that when you have ten thousand people coming towards your country\nThe military has an obligation a duty to get involved that I Do believe now you may disagree with me and I'll go to your phone calls one eight hundred for seven for nine\nSeven three to let me go to Charlie thanks are wedding Charlie you're on the bench for August and show how Charlie go ahead\nMan show a this is not immigration this is an invasion\nAnd I think the president by law has the right to do whatever you need to do to prevent this set in the military down to the border and stop this crap once for all my ten thousand people\nSense they seem like an angry mob coming toward your country and go ahead and try to stop this you won't be able to\nYeah and they may not be armed traditionally the way out of a military campaign is armed but they are armed they're armed with all sorts of long headed thinking that are that we know are going to be used to underline the values of this country ... it's ... it's a military ...\nNot in the traditional sense of military campaign but it is it it's certainly a campaign it's funded it's scheduled\nAnd ... and it ought to be characterized as an invasion and we and he Donald Trump is right on the money when it comes to have enough a military presence and if necessary uh you know then that we're gonna have to use military force if they if they don't get the message any other way\nYou know one of the things gym that I think is interesting is is that you know I most most people when I'm and I want to get your take on this do you have problems with refugees coming in this country as long as they do it's a legal way\nAbsolutely not I think that our ... our immigration system is clearly broken we need to straighten it out we needed to straighten out for for Fifteen Years um and and the enemies of this country I have been using this broken system\nTo to to further their purposes and their aims for a long time and a ... immigration is what this country is all about\nThe ... are the the power of of America comes from people who wants to be free and who\nAnd I asked this question why is it that there are other people to try to find the right way that are going through at the right way okay we're going and doing it the right way why should\nThese ten thousand plus get to move ahead of them\nJust because they broke into our country to bend Ferguson show\nMuch more after this caught A R P I found\nOut just how liberal AARP was about a month ago and it shocked me did you know they are supporting to keep Obamacare the law the land did you know they're fighting against almost every legislative agenda that Donald Trump's in favor of well if you're a member of Arab ...

this see what you think about it one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to uh let me go to George thinks are winning you're on the bench Ferguson show go ahead\nYes hardest thing I like to say is that President Trump is doing the right thing\nI Am the place and that came over in the Nineteen fifties from New York and they should stop all of this immigration nonsense and go back to the a plan they had in the fifties you have to have a sponsor first of all\nAnd that sponsor usually gave you a job for you to when they will be on your own in the country get another job this thing is\nIf something when Wallace you sponsors responsible for you in other words that was no such thing is going on welfare and that's one of the big problems here and what happens\nIs if the sponsor didn't want to do anything you went back to the ... you came from and that's the way it should be\nSee I I agree with you because it used to be accountability there now it's well I don't want to have to deal with any of the accountability the government or the the Democratic Party has in essence become the sponsor\nThat's correct and and and so they say there is no\nThere is no one to show you the ropes there's no one to get you connected in the community there is no one there to hold you accountable to work their tail off there is no one there for any of that because now it's just get in this country will give you free health care will give your kids free schooling we'll give you everything you want for free\nYeah it's all political and is is basically getting voted for the ... that that's the only thing they have left everything else\nIs a failure you look at any city if the Democrats had what kept your sticks to eat it and you can follow that city of bankruptcy\nPeople are moving out of those places and into places that have a bed at tech schools I mean this is a big big ... and if you use to avoid any invasion that is correct word to use here\nOkay because they were in the past ... you know this goes back to Alaska gene a neighbor appetizing\nFull page ads in ... cities to South America and they may cities and

I I always look at the first four games of the season and we're just on the other side of that now and people have all these really\nThe rash opinions about what they've seen through the first quarter that's used and anybody who knows football knows this\nUh nobody season is won or lost in the first word games we got to get through this hump this no October and November tumble where we get to see who is perseverance we've seen it many times also you can sneak into the playoffs with a lower record and make a ton of noise in January so a lot to be learned about all these ...\nOkay James Caan or with the first score of the day is\nGoing to pop in from five yards out for the dealers what I don't know after review is whether or not it's going to stand it's going to be close as to whether or not the knee was down before you reach across on the goal line also it looked like Detroit just scored a touchdown however I think\nOf why just called it back and it was kidding golladay which means it really ticks me off because I've got Kenny or in both legs and so this just ruining my right wrist right here Kenny Golladay from fifty yards out beautiful cats in the end zone touchdown no just kidding there's a flag\nYeah may have been on hold may have been a whole thing about it but\nI'll tell ya I like this spot for the lion's today you don't like this spot for the lines today producer Lee I'm Sorry [laughter] wind up actors you know I Love me some Green Bay you know I Love me all the folks up in Wisconsin\nI just think this is a rough spot for Green Bay today there are two won and won their very banged up they're not clicking a and the lions at one in three at home or going to be a desperate football team and he might McCarthy give the ball the air and Jones those are my things I Want to say about this football game\nYeah well you know outside of Detroit's first game\nAgainst the jets where they got out early dominated on both sides of the ball a I I really do respect to a map Patricia done there because those guys didn't quit and boy oh boy well I don't feel but to retail ... game\nThat was a that was low and around and he'll took it all the way down to the thirty are lined the jags however there was a flag along the way so not in the backfield\nBut something tells me this is going to be a block in the back and this is going to do all we got a ... so this one's coming back at least part of the way and more redo first down so golladay and hill right out of the game\n[laughter] really they call the same you can look on your wide out who are willing blockers you love this stop and you really\nDo but that's gentlemen Ramsey use a physical corner and he got tied up would walk in then and on his way down there was a lot of Jersey being held so that one goes back in and they'll be first in twenty instead of a first down on the twenty\nWe did learn this though he'll does not seem bothered by the wet grass no ... that he he looks justice fat the way down yeah he uh yeah\nUh ... hill can run folks I don't know if you've noticed is a very short time and then it fell but he is extraordinary with the ball in his hand so that is good news for Kansas City but again you know the running game right there on that plane just a quick outside playing near side\nA Korean hunt tackled a with a two yard game\nI I think this is going to have to be a game where you really aim to run the ball inside the tackles because if you're going to stretch the feel left around ... should say east and west instead of going north and south you're going to have those situations where a runner is gonna have to get his feedback on during before he can actually turn up feel\nOK I Believe that touchdown indeed in Pittsburgh was overturned so ah the review shows James Connors elbow or looking at the freeze frame right now by the way he's not down at the one he's down to one inch line yeah the ... that ball shy of the goal line with the elbow down so you're starting goal from inside the one\nWho knows the ball is almost already Blake breaking the plane in fact when I played center when we had situations like this just to screw with the defense I Would put my feet right next to the bone I'd extended into the end zone\nOr you know obviously those don't count as such sounds and James Caan or what they really being run over the middle of the offensive formation healers first blood and\nThere you go yeah so and that's what this game's going to be all about if you don't score on one play it is okay you don't store on the next one and we're going to see in Pittsburgh today and now it's official the Steelers are on the board six stopping within a PHD try on the way and that is the first score of the game there are many more\nNo doubt to calm Baker may

I'm confused or that one one minute yeah he he can't hurt who was laughing next Middle Eastern ... I'm a little confused here so\nThe league is changing it's an aerial attack down field it seemed like and every single game and you got you I mean who can't get the fall down feeling [noise]\nAnd I'm not just saying that can take a shot at it [noise]\nBut it's the truth [laughter] he line Manning's longest pass completion on the season is thirty seven yards [noise] that puts him thirty six in the NFL behind every starting quarterback [noise] a couple of backup quarterback\nI I just see so many striking similarities between these two divisions I feel like the rams are about to go on a roll of dominance in that division for a long time\nYeah I mean look you look at what they're doing I think the saving grace\nIs from a financial standpoint or can the rams do this for a long period of time it it looks good but they've spent so much money guys like ... there are going to be pieces that over the next couple of years will go away or drop below in theory will be healthy I mean the story will take its turn I think about this year looks like\nAn easy here about Jared golf though his\nCareer was going one way and then all of a sudden showing McVeigh comes and revitalize is him could this be a situation where a head coach really has the you're the player to the point where buddy if if you can take less and we can get more we can keep this train a role and\nThink about Tom Brady yup it I mean he was buried on that roster he got into the injury he realized how lucky you are to get the opportunity to play for a great team and a half before to this moment to step in and an injury situation never left New England I could see this happening for the rams with golf\nIn that I could see it I just do there aren't that many times when it comes to\nCut is I don't you know there are ... ... ...\nYou know I'm All right we'll check in on sea hawks and rams with joy Taylor and just a second here on red zone radio but first we're going to check in with David Guy\nYeah buddy buddy no way am I taking a big get up and Jared guy I okay not really a pay cut he will get a raise one way or the way I watch them a raise you know that many rings ... right well if I'm not married okay fair enough but it's also by the\nWay late is single ready also mango yeah speaking of being single and Josh and the lowly Buffalo Bills that are up early\nSecond attempt bills that's fourteen no score you're\nFor\nThe Minnesota Vikings to on the bills radio network so they have the advantage early on seven to nothing riches this funny to you what\nYour laughter Josh I I just I don't know actually on the other one\nIs the weather is\nLike a news do you do it got clown shoes aren't they rent\nThe bills right out seven or nothing but the advantage rabies on top of the brown three nothing there Detroit with a seven nothing advantage over Green Bay drama Alice another ballgame law Randall cob in Kansas City\nRolling left is my home slipping ... going to\nHave\nTouchdown and Jacksonville\nFeel that it's first\nThis season in the first half and it comes on the chief's first possession\nGosh now that one is funny [laughter] you know why\nDo you do this is my ... year you know it's pouring there do you\nHear the hollow this about coal and all the all the window down here just in the rain and sideways\nAnd yet they bring in the boom my from outside of both say this the reason why giggle at play calls is because I sit next to these guys I Do the color analysis and when they really get rolling like that you realize oh yeah it's just you guys in a booth\nYeah he shouted goofy is that as you out and\nThat's part two is because the voice it sounds so big but when you meet the people in person early\nThen you're like five times like Hollywood he versus other one is for all of it yeah on a cruise a\nThree foot set up but he does his death stunts are true they can see seven nothing to do is Mississippi the Boswell miss that any way so Pittsburgh lead the Atlanta just six to nothing there Caroline I'm just going to the scoreboard so they leave New York seven to three there's no ... in Cincinnati Bengals and dolphins goose eggs guys back to you\nOkay ... thanks rely on Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would go to guy with a comical eight hundred dollars for seven all of the only hard parts\nFiguring out which way is easier reminder also for free winters daily go to Vegas covers dot com Vegas covers dot com let's go straight north of Seattle the rams will be visiting the sea hawks today so we get to visit with\nJoy sailor hey joy what don't you need to work in the morning\nOr good I'm good you know sitting in chairs that we used to sit in together venue that they don't they don't belong there you know come to that with me anymore but anyway\nUh let's check in on this game the rams embassy all this is a this is something written I I've been following very closely because uh we work during the week I'm a flash of British for San Diego state were bigger shot penny fans\nAnd this guy just cannot seem to get to the top of the depth John even though he's a first round draft pick very strange what's going on with the Seahawks running game\nOh well I was running game is a show\nToday because obviously they lost their first game trying to rely on some of it all and I felt like you\nKinda get out of pocket and then provide some world and they are they going to try and get away from that because that they won they relied on running running game it's going and that underneath that because obviously the ramp up and killing at right now\nTaking the lead by storm and he acts event is pretty much that they are they going to have had to come back there and often um college so that they're well he'll sell the whole day riots and comment so uh yeah they gave it to that\nLast weekend it you have golf thrown for sixty five five touchdowns zero interceptions on thirty three attempts with twenty six completion die\nI mean it looked near perfect it was actually a perfect pastor rating where does this off its go from here ten anybody stop the rams\nUm I I don't think so [laughter] I think it's going to have to weigh in on that you got it on the day and like I said ... coming up against Iran not what you want to be the only thing I found that having that they have but\nYou know they're very often that's operating at such a high level that ... that that that\nEven for the oc and keep them off because they got that made it like that and the confidence that GOP Nick they're playing with right now it's even that day and they they have some effect but the the I thought he playing playing in Seattle it's a different kind of had you know they haven't really seen a California yet\nAnd they all did that you know you know they haven't really seen any adversity so far so that they're treating this game that they don't want to go into it thinking that it's a giant chain guys out there right now I'm actually coming up\nLast week before man but I mean they're rolling right now so that the that's the heat them up feel joy\nTaylor with us see on the rams later today on Fox I'm Glad you met with John McVeigh and Jared golf I have a question about these two guys it almost feels like out of the game we have a little bit of a microcosm of what Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have dealt with for years where people are going is a Brady are Isabel jak Isabel check or is it Brady\nJared golf is playing really well but I don't hear a lot of people saying that it's Jerry golf a lot of people give credit to Sean McVeigh what did you\nWhat did you gather from talking to these two guys\nIt's funny that you say that again after they left the room talking about how uh\nHow they ... on on point the two of them are and you can tell that they're all under the age is as he got a lot of things terminology and uh just ... when they are answering questions summer\nAnd I I that's the guy that was like no it's not very valid check yet what does happen um except for you know a little more uh you know highly than a dollar jackets by yeah you definitely have a point there um\nThey give each other credit though um\nWe're we're we're all we're all kind of trying to get to the bottom of like how to turn around its team from having the opposite end of the year later having it back up and then now gossiping about what would have been a thought you really I mean between him and I'm the only discussion for NBC this year\nThe remarkable and they won't give us a hidden camera but basically what they say they both say is that there's a lot of chance ... Haitian within ... and they often worked really hard and I mean we all like to think that if we hardly have jak often you know starting quarterback for the LA rant but\nUh you know like they had some kind of the formula that maybe one day we'll get the thirty or thirty or something but\nTo me the metric I got from it that they're they're all really on the same page they all just go to work everyday and really focused and\nYou know we talked to you know he kind of had the same same launch it though I I guess the answer but I'm sure there is a much more technical a think tank opted to turn that around\nStaying on the rams are really talks about up and so I think the defense has not done enough press their top ten they're yielding less than twenty points to game yeah wait fill up to now the Denver Broncos miss him there middling defense with one of the world's best pass Russia's von Miller\nWhat has weighed done with this organization that so special on that side of the ball\nYeah yeah well ... and that's becoming more of a thing don't get me wrong he'll get his but they have options offensively and so I don't think number eleven is the first thought or top of mind is play schemes words you used to be a Julio Jones is deficient when you're throwing the ball I think he is better\nOr as the two honestly because as a one over the past season or so it hasn't been great sharing the spotlight with some of these running backs out of the backfield with a with Calvin Ridley now I think it takes some of the pressure off I think he actually shines more when he has help\nOffend well yeah I don't know whether it's easy to one or whatever I can just say spreading the the the wealth around a little bit is probably a healthy thing for Julio it's probably a healthy thing for ah for the entire\nAh Atlanta Falcons off it so keep an eye on that one looks like a fun one today Thirteen to seven Steelers one that already is threatening to get out of hand\nIs Detroit already leading Green Bay fourteen to nothing erasures just fumbled the ball Detroit picked it up\nAnd so they've got really good feel position Detroit how's the ball already knocking on the door of the red zone again a leading fourteen to nothing and just everything about this game has been a total disaster from the Packers standpoint early going they got one drive into going physician based in Crosby missed a field goal\nRemember weren't a weather controlled environment it was not that long ago you'll go just pulled it left a and now they've turned the ball over have not been able to sustain anything they've got all of the injuries as far as the receiving corps is concerned about the ... doesn't doesn't even have a ... yet uh this is just been\n... yeah and the lines again I think better than than they showed out early in the season on prime time football so everybody has this thought process about Detroit going into the season and it's ill conceived because map Patricia has proven\nTo be a more greedy and determine coach in a I'm a a better team than I I think anybody expected to see the season they have a lot of weapons offensive well you mentioned golladay earlier golden ... obviously ... staffers who everybody\nLoves to pile on with this this theory that he's padding stats at the end of a lot of losing efforts but I'll tell you this right now I don't care if it's at the end the games I don't care if it's at the beginning of the game I don't care if it's when you're you're going down in the fourth quarter to win the whole potato\n... if you are putting up the sort of statistics that match Stafford is put up over his career that's a good quarterback in this defense is playing inspired right now after having a really tough start against the jets they've built themselves back up to a what looks like a contender I don't know if that when this division but they'll give a lot of people problems\nAll right we uh we are trying to gather information on what just happened to Carolina Panthers just took a fourteen three lead they already had a cab Newton to Kurdish Daniel touchdown play earlier in the game\nBut they've just scored again let me read the game cast report for you that just came down in front of us here it is um the Panthers pond\nDown to the giants too old outback must the cat's tested the giants to recovered by the giants Norris Jenkins at the New York giants five Jenkins to the New York giants three for two yards from balls recovered by Carolina at the New York giants zero\nTouchdown Graham good no extra points because what we have is above\nFollowed by a recovery followed by another fumble followed by a recovery and the Panthers are in the ads out\nBy the way if you're following this Jacksonville game that's in Kansas City right now to Kansas City looking great offensively Jacksonville\nMonday or go Caesar yelled at and the Kansas City territory that and\nThat is going to be something you're going to hear I say a lot during the game because they are out of back so Leonard for net out and court grant just left the field or on a cart because he has a lower leg injury that occurred in their last series or before the break here and so TJ yelled and going to get a lot of run out of the backfield for Jacksonville\nAlright yelled and already on the day\nYeah looking yeah outlets that he has only had one target did not make the cat so seven carries thirty nine yards grand I'd want to carry got hurt on that they don't have any other they gotta have some other back on the roster I go into the game but you\nKnow my my yeah my guess is they have a now they're back to active I have no idea who it is because I went to the fish will a page for the Jacksonville Jaguars checked out there that shark Corey Grant is the last on the list Leonard we're not and yelled in ahead of him so I don't know who they put into jail yelled and\nI'm seeing a guy on the roster named Brandon Wilds out of ... to ...\nYou just grab the you just grab the run up came off your status is active or not a parachute years so this is what happens he may be especially the ... been a scout\nGuy got activated for game we I don't know but they're in trouble in the backfield in Jacksonville they don't have a lot of their horses walk\nAll right and tend to nothing is the score for the chiefs already in that game and actually interesting thought to Bruce religious with regards to you know they should do or they should bring in ... Jack and let him be running back remember you've got to college I don't use it all over the field\nI Would love that gosh if he gets a goal like charity day Lee a donor submitted next week [laughter]\nThat Jerry is that right now today and actually if he doesn't do that certainly that's rich anyway I don't\nReally shocked because I'll tell you I've seen it where tight and split off into tacos in situations where injuries came up in bunches so uh yeah I I bet you they're starting to circle the wagons\nReal goal for the line there up by seven genes ravens are knocking on the door up three now two working for more leptin all of it coming up next week five\n[noise]\nIf you need anything from a simple home repairs to a major ... you need to know about home at either it's a totally free service that instantly connected with top local service proudest\nMoment visor is a very easy way to find a home contractor and for me it's the only way\nYou can either for everything your house cleaning European hanging electricians climbers handyman we've had nothing\nEvery single time just to let the type of work you need done and home advisors ... technology instantly finds pop pros and your area you can read customer reviews of the ... even use their ... guide to find out what hundreds of other repairing improvement project caught\nIn your area I think everybody should have either in fact I tell everybody how might aren't home advisors a total solution to any type of work you would ever want to do around your house and best of all it's completely free got hammered by their dot com or download the free yeah um\n[noise]\nKnow here's a little something that you miss from the bed ... show\nThe people that feel good or the analytically obsessed front office nerds because they were the ones that instructed the demotion of quake Kirsch off so that is some say a cold blooded movie it was a bold move was he disrespect move it goes against all of the standard baseball addict\nThat standard baseball etiquette is you're thirty million dollar race or is the number one starter in a playoff series that's the way you do it he's got all the Cy Young awards about love and da da da da da da ... reason decision based on recent performance by ... and\nWriting the hothead because the data people will get better rights that were used better pitcher in the moment but the un Jean where you are his nickname should be the garden now why shouldn't be called the Gardner\nBecause he was more than ... he's out being land a brave line up there he was\nSeen them up is what he was doing\nIn Atlanta game plan it was kind of obvious you you're not a baseball person the strategy for land and their line up was like okay we're going to make were you throw a ton of pitches and we're going to go deep into the town\nAnd we're going to get some walks we're going to get on base that way we're going to give you a chance you could throw pressure pitches right runners on first runners on second and ... and you've got to really lock in right those are the pressure pictures are supposed to be the worst thing in baseball I\nWell this was not only a quality of parents it was the fish and he was dominant\nTo get the rest of what Big Bend set pod cast dead by searching the Ben ... show and is always you can hear the Ben Miller show weekdays at two AM eastern eleven pm Pacific right here on Fox Sports radio\nShow\nFriend Mike\nYankees beat the eight seven to ... try to do it tonight by\nGoing with the bullpen game tried to bullpen bull panic is a thing called painting is a thing it's like clubbing for hiking both ending is a thing or swinging it's a thing now\nWhere teams are going to try and the play offs\nTo instead of starting a traditional starting pitcher if they don't have good enough starting pitchers were going to go with bullpen yeah I never knew momentum ... guys coming in to pitch\nThe majority of the ... I mean it might be strange at first but eventually it's a lifestyle the games except it yeah and and I know many people are down on vote pending and why are you having bullpen pitchers come in and it's the first couple of these well not every team has two or three really good start\nSponsored by Colorado a one one of the Colorado broadcasters association and this station\n\nMike rice Corey Lopez Rockies react after this season ending six nothing lost to the birds in game three of the LDS at Coors Field we are full lines we appreciate that will be getting to as many calls as we can but quickly Greg throughout a couple of names let's just take one ... what do you think happens there with no and what do you want to see him do Goree\nWell it's interesting I saw that a a Patrick Saunders actually kinda tweeted this out and having that chance you know the media hordes get down there and had a chance to talk to them no one says the ... expects\nTo be in spring training with the Rockies and at the same time he doesn't want to talk about it right now because the nervous a little raw after the loss in the end of the season um you and I have talked about this on Rocky's react a little bit about no and I think the conversation has to be had with Nolan about what does he\nExpect from the Rockies what kind of contract are you looking at and if it's too much for the Rockies then there's moves that have to be made and it also means\nThat you can make some other moves with guys who's contracts are coming up this year and the guy that comes to mind Mike to me is DJ LeMahieu and I think no one's decision and how much money is available may directly affect\nOr indirectly affect a DJ it'll make you coming back next year\nWe'll see how all of that works out but I Would agree I think that decision with Nolan if you know for sure if the Iraqis know for sure and I think they have to get a real good idea\nIf they're going to be able to sign him long term because if not and then you have a budget amounts set for Nolan then that affects everything else you do I'm not saying that they would automatically keep DJ\nBut I think there's a better chance because I don't know Brendan Rogers is going to be major league ready coming out of spring training that's a tall order even for someone his talented as him and I think if you have long term plans for Rogers at second I think the guy who gets you there in the short term\nIs if it's not DJ is Garrett Hampton but I don't I think camps in would probably probably be better suited for that super utility role kind of like we've seen ... more last year than this year have\nFor the Rockies and I think I think Hampton is a is a more skilled and in more talented player\nThan pat let's get to a couple more phone calls Dennis is in Littleton joining us on Rocky's react guy Dennis\nI I'm Wondering if I put the D. J. thing and then some other stuff but you know I think one of the worst things that happened to him story the story of three home runs and then when DJ at that walk off against Arizona\nI didn't see him do is classic inside out swinging or he was rolling over on every ... even today's game it was that the double the ... you wrote over shortstop ... you know it worked for for ...\nJeter fame and work for a DJ when he was a winning ... titles and starting to think I think the biggest one of the big things about going to court field\nIs that it makes you feel is that you know everybody Babe Ruth but you've got a small ball in the in the playoffs because the pitch and great and of all people Alex Rodriguez was saying that tore sold them all the time I\nDon't know ... on single single single the good things will happen I think we fall into that trap that wants to comment on that at least that's kind of it you know who cares at this point but still\nYeah oh yeah I'll take the D. J. thing I might buy might have some thoughts on this as well I think DJ tried to expand his horizons a little bit and become a more complete hitter I appreciate what you had to say and uh and what DJ was really good at\nAnd that is going the other way and that inside out swaying but\nPeople started to shift on him that became the book on D jays will make you that he was normally going to go the other way and he wasn't going to pull the ball so he tried to do that now granted his batting average dropped to about two Seventy six for the season here\nThis year but I think tried to use all fields as opposed to always being inside out I think trying to expand the horizons and Mike I mean whether it was a failed experiment or not it certainly\nUm what's different to see DJ doing that I don't think he got greedy and and I don't think he thinks he's going to be a home run hitter but I think he tries to do more things when he's up there so they can't shipped into that are inside out swaying\nYeah I mean I I'm always reluctant to say this is what he was trying to do just because it happened that way I don't know that he wanted to roll everything over or if he was making a conscious effort to swing for the fences\nI think the Rockies and know that if they can players talk about this all the time if they keep their approach the same if they look to drive the ball the home runs will come Charlie Black when it's told me that no one has said that ... story has talked about it\nThe reason why Rockies hitters get them the reputation of\nTrying to hit home runs is because of the ballpark it's sort of lends itself to that and I I think at some level it's unfair so Dennis I'm not trying to cop out on your question because clearly the batting average number was down for DJ the power number he had a career Hi what Fifteen Seventeen home runs whatever it was yeah yeah\nSo I ... I Would really have to talk to a DJ to say where are you making a conscious effort to hit more homeruns my guess is he would say no could have just been a year where\nMore flare hits didn't fall maybe he got away at times from going or trying to go middle right in in in his approach I don't know so I'm not trying to cop out I just don't want to speak for him\nIn a way that that because I just don't know I Will say this the average is down across the board average is not the only measure of successful hitting these days it can be a good measure of success will hitting\nFact of the matter is a\nDJ LeMahieu if the if the Rockies can keep him I'd want him to keep him his ... is off the charts and that's a big of a reason as any for me\nSo I'm Sorry Mike I keep jumping in and right and it just to add one more thing it is interesting eleven or those Fifteen home runs came on the road [laughter]\nYou ask him to be a monster on the road but and also this to you as well that you know the best person to answer this would be obviously DJ um\nI talked about him maybe trying to become a more complete hitter and Mike you know this in baseball there's a lot of factors they may have been pitching him a little differently this year after being the NFL batting champion that he had been seeing different pitches as well yep\nThree three seven one three eighty five eighty five on Rocky's react

know what food stamps through your whole life is not living a good life\nGovernment aid your whole life is not living a good life\n\nThat's what I think about this\nAnd people said that county west sounded insane I heard that over and over and over again they Kanye West sounded crazy and that's what one of the callers earlier I I Want to go back to a chance on this one chance and I asked her I said what Kanye say at the White House ... that was crazy crazy talk\nWell the first thing he said was about to start with the man it was like oh you are you serious did you really just say that you know that the thirteenth man\nYou're what you're saying that him talking about amendments is insane\nThat's not what I said you know what the thirteenth eliminated you know what that was the beginning of\nThe constitution United States of America neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime where of the party's show have been Julie convicted shall exist within the United states or any place subject to their jurisdiction that ... that was\nThe beginning you're still not getting their you're still not\nThat I I just I ... yeah clearly I Know what it was about what is your point\nThere now but no you really don't know what is\nThat the thirteenth man that was it was to abolish slavery and involuntary servitude ... as as punishment for a crime either\nListen if they're going to say I don't know when I just quoted to you I'm going to answer your darn question the Thirteen them at the United States Constitution abolish slavery first off second of all it also abolish involuntary servitude which is what many slave overs we're saying whether or not my slaves\nTheir their their servants and that's different and so they made sure that involuntary servants who was there and then they said some of them said well they're actually just criminals and they are paying off their debts for crimes\nSo they even had an except as punishment for a crime\nThis happened and I think it was ... Eighteen fifty four sixty four or five remember from history and I apologize I don't have the exact year it was it was in that either the Eighteen fifty four sixty four that own it is I Know exactly what you're talking about\nThat will be able to rescue eight years old and put in jail for three years or spending on the street\nThat I ... I usually just explain that to you what is your point\nYou haven't explained it to me I'm trying to tell you you're just not ...\nOkay I Want to paint ... chance that ... you just brought up something I just explained it to the listeners they knew we were talking about you're announcing I didn't explain it\nI just explained it to so let's let's move back to the actual conversation about Kanye West and not a conversation of you know can you quote the constitution stay the constitution\nAn awful lot when I was younger I Know a lot about the constitution\nThe show is not about the constitution I it's about\nPeople like you who are acting like because Kanye West is now all of a sudden they conservative believing in conservative values that you guys are now trying to turn him into some sort of crazy bipolar sleep deprived\nA insane individual instead of respecting his opinion and saying he's an Uncle Tom because he's not being a quote real black man the\nThing is what you're not listen and you just said something earlier that when you said living on food stamps is not a lifestyle living outside the gate the majority of black people have to think you still have that sort of the United states population the Muslim people don't live like that you may need so much from those inner cities and things like they can attribute that to everybody black because\nThat I didn't I didn't the number one recipient of welfare in this country single white females that's right okay I Know it's ... ... chance don't don't act like when I when when I give us that you go that's right like you're teaching me something I'm the one that just quoted you\nThat information I Know who the number one recipient is the food stamps I never implied what you just implied I Want to make that very clear\nBut what I'm telling you is that the head up the it's not a battery represent them black public ... that that's no big deal but\nThere are very few black Republican in their\nHair out on oil or chance there are very few black Republicans that's just a fact statistically African Americans as\nA race okay African Americans as they race overwhelmingly vote democratic\n\nThen it's Hispanics but the number one by race that ... is African Americans are Democrats\nIt has no I'm a Democrat the Republican like that have nothing to do with it but it\nSure does it has everything to do with when a Republican what look at what Democrats say the Clarence Thomas a black man when he was going to be on the Supreme Court think about that\nThinking about that\nThat the only way to accomplish that\nThey try to destroy his life\n\nThat doesn't mean that was something that has nothing to do anything but I'm like\nOkay All right I'm going to move on I've had enough of this conversation one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to melt then you're on the bench Ferguson showing the Patriot mobile dot com phone lines trying to get Melvin back Alex you are on the bench\nFerguson show Hi Alex go ahead [noise] hey man can you hear me I can hear you just fine nice to talk to you tonight\nThat's awesome [noise] um yeah just\nYou know you noticed one of the things that I said there was he talked about stop and frisk\nHe's not in favor of it in Chicago you heard the media to talk about that no because that's not crazy does the media that's not crazy oh\nNow that's not that's not that that actually makes sense\n\nThat's not crazy that makes sense\n\nThat makes that makes complete sense\n\nAn African American guy who's again stop and frisk who's saying it to the ... the United states America the same week the president's that maybe they should you stop and frisk a again in Chicago to get calm under control and county I stood up to the president on that in the oval office did you see that headlined by liberal media\nNo because Kanye West we're sending up to the president and talking about the president and a good way

U.S in Saudi Arabia over the fate of a missing journalist\nBecause Kanye West is an authentic black man\nKanye West is a real African American man that lives in an African American world that is a part of African American culture\nClarence Thomas was never a real threat to the hard core Democratic Party that's black because they already turned him into a white guy who married by the way a white woman they slandered him that way\nYou didn't have to worry about Ben Carson being a real black man for example because Ben Carson was too smart that's what I was told by a blackout a Democrat\nWho said well he's not a real black man said why it's like he's he he he literally act like it was a kind of thing that he's ... he's a neurosurgeon he's on he's not a real black man\n\nIt's not a real black man so if you're successful and as a doctor you're no longer a black man well he never grew up in the neighborhood that I grew up in okay Kanye West it by the way\nTony west of the guy that also has said things that were cheered by the left and the Democratic party when he came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people at that fundraiser after Hurricane Katrina hit and nobody\nSaid the Kanye West was an Uncle Tom that no one said he wasn't black then no one said he was crazy that no one said he was bipolar that\nWas the Democratic party has done this week they've done two things that kind of a west all because he wears a make America great again hats\nWell challenging the president issues like stop and frisk which a lot of African Americans I think would agree with me is a policy that they feel like is an inappropriate policy based on race\nThat it allows police officers to target minorities disproportionately stop and frisk that's the reason why judges said it was unconstitutional it's the reason why will not be done in any city in this country because it will be immediately shut down\nBut what Kanye West's they've done two things that kind of this week one they have taken away any of his accomplishments by saying that he has an ignorant dumb man\nHe isn't ignorant and dumb man in fact democratic leaders came out and they said they said this about ... they said that ... and I'm going to play this for you because I Want you to hear it they said this about Kanye West\nWas rapidly negroes don't read ah\nKanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nTell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nKanye West is what happens when he grows don't read\nOne more time to tell you is what happens when they grow don't read\nNow\nDid anybody say that about Kanye West when he came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people know because he was a hero then of the left but what Kanye West is doing now is Kanye West is a guy who was\nHas a lot of influence in the African American community and they know it and they're terrified so they've got to turn them into a crazy man this week I heard people say that the president was taking advantage of a mentally unstable man that clearly needs to be in a hospital\nAll because he supports the president the United states America now now what did he say that was so crazy and again I said there's certainly if you're watching us on Facebook Live a please share this video\nSo that hopefully other African Americans are thinking about maybe not voting party lines in the midterms who might be thinking about voting for some Republicans who actually see this I Hope that this goes viral hope a million two million people\nHere this because I'm trying to lay out the incredible amount of racism is coming from the Democratic party towards African Americans African Americans the Democratic party they don't they don't respect your intelligence\nIn fact they don't want you to become an independent thinker because it's a threat to their party they don't want you to have\nGood paying jobs because then you don't need the Democratic party more for government aid and welfare they don't want you to be unsuccessful schools that's the reason why they keep you and your kids in failing schools and failing community so that you'll be desperate for their government aid when they fail you when it comes to your education\nThey don't want you to do\nAmazing things in your life because if you do you have less need for the government which means you have less need for the Democratic party\n\nI I mean this is that this is nothing but flat out racism\nWhen when when when you are a Democrat and you come out against ... and I said this earlier can you imagine if a white guy can you imagine if a black Republican would have said this about colon cap for Nick when he started kneeling can you imagine what would have happened to the magic of a black\nRepublican would have said about colon cancer and at the same thing with a black Democrats said about Kanye West\nWas rapidly negroes don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it and promoted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with mentally fix or some\nToken Democrats staying with them and take pictures can you imagine if a black Republican would have said that about ... this is what happens when ... when a negro doesn't read\nIf you think the Democratic party cares about you as an African American\nI Would say look at the last week if you think the Democratic party respects you as an African American I Would say look at the Democratic party\n\nDo yourself a favor just just go tell a democratic elected official you're thinking about voting for Republican just thinking about it posted up on social media posts on your timeline hey I'm an African American man or woman but I'm thinking about voting for Republicans the midterms and watch how fast\nYou're democratic friends will turn on you\nWatch how fast they will come after you watch how fast they will call you an Uncle Tom\nThey won't encourage a ... some sort of debate\nThey won't encourage\nA you to think you know to to to have an open discussion you will lose your blackness you will become a leopard and the African American democratic community you will be come what they have done to ... this week which is to take away one his blackness then take away his intelligence\nAnd then take away his brain function to say he's mentally ill\nBecause what they're implying here it's\nThere's no real black man would ever support Donald Trump unless they are mentally ill they're saying that every Democrat that supports president who's black\nEvery black man that supports Donald Trump you clearly are bipolar sleep deprived mentally insane mentally incompetent\nNow I'll be clear about this when I was watching counted the oval office I thought he was unique\nYou clearly were not watching a politician I also didn't think I was watching a crazy bipolar man that was sleep deprived I thought I was watching exactly what I expected from Kanye West a unique individual that likes to be unique\nWho's been embraced by the African American community since for the last almost Twenty years\nAnd then all of a sudden because he sits with Donald Trump for\nHe's no longer a black man for\nBut we'll call them and negroes who doesn't ring for\nAnd you think the Democratic party cares about you as an African American one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight

nothing great they need you to be under educated they need you to not\nBe able to live a life where you can walk away from high crime and high poverty and failing schools they need your kids to be under educated so they won't succeed on their own they need you to not have high employment rate so you're you and your family or your friends are still somewhat dependent on the government for your food for your housing\nThey need you to live in areas that are not still was success but though with a lot of failures so that you'll need them more to survive\n\nAnd what Kanye West has gone through this week he had the assault on his literally the his mental state the assault on his education the assault on his blackness the he's an Uncle Tom he's being used by the president he's not a real black man stop playing is music on the radio\nHe's alive\nHis mind is proof that the Democratic party will destroy any black person is fast\nAnd they tried to score ... destroyed Brett Kavanaugh when ... when the when leaders and former elected officials in the Democratic party come out and said this about you as ... because you met with the president\nIs what happens when they grow don't read\nThat tells you how little respect they have for you as an African American\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to the patriots were not compromise or open I Want to go back to

the beginning\nThat you should go ahead [noise] Mr partners\nYes slow yeah I got to go ahead has this ought to be speaking with you started great monologue a hero everything that he talks about\nMaking some profound points and for someone to describe our midst of West as what happens what in the world don't read he's exactly what happens with the negro Oprah's his eyes\nAh first of all I'm offended by the term African American\nOr my people argued Bijan is to this country I'm an American African kind of like the Indians are black people are finally starting to wake up and see the point is to the fact that when we were first a given the right to vote\nAnd we have a chance to finally vote when we went down to the polls in the south of Democrats will be a grandfather and great grandmothers heads in and make them vote Democrat again brainwashed into ... voting Democrat\nAnd so then when the next generation came along and they went down to vote it was like oh you better go down the vote Democrat but that's over now is over now a\nEyes are open and people are educated people jewelry and this is what's happening right now and I just want you to know that the ...\nOf them and how many here let me ask you how many how many of the African American friends are are are saying are are are like ... or in talking the way that you're talking right now I mean is it is it a lot yeah nominally now or is it really starting to change\n... and ... we we said a lot of them stayed away from voting for Trump they didn't vote for Hillary because Hillary didn't convince anybody and they couldn't move themselves to vote for Trump sure but now that it's happened\nFolks are starting to see that it's all about business is all about money in their pockets and people will be able to be able to provide a a\nA life for their families you know it'd be prosperous and not be on food stamps and not be on a Conyers was right on point you know that's the ... subject to the Democratic party has had black folks are good for the last fifty years\nSaid when when was how long have you on your break does change how long\nWere you a Democrat I mean for how many years ...\nNever I came straight out of high school and listening to the Marines are served in Desert Storm back with the first Bush and uh most uh a barrack in Africa is in the military are Republican\nBecause we already saw that they had the Democrats had done anything for a ... they didn't do anything for the previous generation so those of us who do we realized that in it you know there was no option but to be Republican\nAnd I've been ostracize about that you know this is a Nineteen Ninety but\nWell let me say two things one thing you for your services country um and and too I really really hope that there are a lot of other people just like you who are already who are ... why we\nHave the president we have today because there are plenty they released it couldn't bring themselves to vote for Trump they didn't go in there and vote for Hillary and vote against it\nHow many how many women to see how many African\nAmericans um the you know around ... police\nAre American American African American Africans you know are going to vote in the midterms for Republicans for the reasons you just said\nEvery one that I Do know because they're so ... is just about everything that's been going on what

Republicans in a sprint to the mid term elections\nOr John the president is largely making the midterms about his agenda and arguing that vote for any Democrat is a vote against the things the president wants to get done in this next week the president plans to hit the campaign trail out west in Montana where Republicans are hoping to pick up a seat in the Senate\n\nDemocrats are upset\n\nThat a black man by the name of Kanye West as not supporting the people that they told him\nTo support think about that\nAnd when he supported the president they first said he was an Uncle Tom\nThen they said we would we would we would shame him health shame him and just saying that he's mentally on well clearly this is the person is mentally on well then they said that the president's taking advantage of a mentally on well man\nThen you had people on TV who are African\nAmerican who went on TV and said this about cognac tell you what is what happens when negroes don't read\nYou've heard that right I'm going to play it again this is what African Americans\nWho are Democrats set on national TV about Kanye West because Kanye West disagrees with them politically so now they just bully him by saying tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nYou heard that right Tanya anyway I says what happens when negroes don't read\n\nAll because Kanye West's likes Donald Trump\n\nNow here's my analogy I Know there's going to be people on the left that are going to freak out by me saying this and before you again don't tweet at me until after I finished the statement because if you tweet at me before I finished the statement I Will not respond because clearly you're ignorant and you're not listening\n\nHis is not the perfect example of a modern day version of slavery what they're doing the Kanye West is this on a perfect example\nOf what slave owners did two slaves to keep them in their lane of slavery\n\nTiny west as a black guy Kanye West back in the day said George Bush hates black people remember that Mr producer can you grab that audio do you mind doing that\nKanye West was a guy that after Hurricane Katrina came out on national TV at a fundraiser and said George Bush hates black people no one said that he was not reading then\nThere wasn't a white Democrat in America when he said that that would have said this afterwards tell you what is what happens when they grow don't really\nThink about that Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nI Would argue that as an incredibly racist statement I Would argue that's a perfect example of modern day slavery from the car sellers now when Kanye West says this after Hurricane Katrina listen to it\nThe most tragic loss of all George Bush doesn't care about black people\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say that tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read no you didn't hear you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou look at what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIt is a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent on their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools\nAnd when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say\nThey say no because we've got employees that are black working in the schools and were unions teachers and you can't destroy public edge for education I Would agree with that you can you've already done some possible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left\nI Would argue that the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing schools\nBecause that keeps them on their plantation that keeps them in modern day slavery\nAnd so what happened was as you have a I I I'm referring to the car sellers and what he said you're a negro who went from living on the plantation miss producer wants to play the audio get this is Kanye West's while living on the plantation talking about George Bush after Hurricane Katrina\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people\nHe said and I quote George Bush hates black people and everybody clapped\nEverybody said Kanye West is a great white man who's calling out an evil white president and it was okay to say that on that you're on that day because that was words that were okay to say on the Democratic plantation then\nThe ... comes out in ... and start singing for himself and search realizing hey this this world I live in slavery is not very good\nI I'm seeing massive crime rates in my hometown of Chicago which apparently is moving back to I'm seeing poverty I'm seeing a kids that are getting a good education I'm seeing all of these things and he starts questioning the plantation owners which is the Democratic party\nHe starts questioning the rich black guys\nWho are running the Democratic party who are telling them that no no no no you need to stay in poverty because well take care of you there I don't know you don't need to think for yourself no no you can't even have an id to vote we're going to make sure you can vote without id because we don't even expect you to have an id how races that mentality\nAnd then Tania says you know what I I I'm going to be independent of independent thinker I'm going to come out and say that I like black unemployment rate it all the time what I like a president that wants to talk about creating jobs the African American community and set of offering up welfare checks and food stamps\nAnd he does it and then they reprimand this man who got off the Democratic plantation tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read how is that not the most racist statement\n\nIs it not racist because the Democrat says it not racist because the black person said is it not racist because\nIt's supported by all Democrats\nThe same Democratic Party that says Donald Trump's tweets are are are horrible\nThe same Democrats say that Donald Trump bullies people and it's terrible that same Democrats today they're sending out tweets\nAbout this ... national coming out day for the gay and lesbian transgender bisexual community and that we should love every one if you get off their plantation they'll say this to you tell us what happens when they grow don't read\nI Want to get in here and get

fun of him after he met with the president\nOf the United states of America\n\nAll because he became a Republican and started thinking for himself I'm not sure you could say became Republican but as soon as he met with Trump this is this is what they say about him\nWas his what happens when negroes don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with men take pictures\nThere it is and take pictures and take pictures\n\nYou walk off the Democratic plantation\n\nHas a black man and you say anything that's outside of the lane of being a ... a hardcore Democrat and they will say you don't read and call you a negro\nIs what happens when they grow don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures\nPolitical that God [laughter] I'd rather than\nBlack folks are about to train Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with habits and he's an attention for like the president he's all of a sudden now that that the model spokes person he is he's the token negro of that of the Trump Administration\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be fatal Tanya what seriously you clearly has issues he's already that\nHe clearly has issues and he's been hospitalized\nWow\nYou know I thought Democrats are the ones that were in favor of having more help for mental health issues and not shaming people in mental health not bowling them on mental health\n\nI thought that I thought they were the party that was supposed to be loving and understanding unless you get off their plantation\n\nLet me remind you of something that happened this last week just to compare and contrast that to differences\nAnd [noise] they were swept came out for the American idol reticent when I Lived in the teeth or think fast congresswoman for more than a decade\n\nTerrified her\nAnd Democrats said look at Taylor Swift look at this grave role model look at this hour for independent woman look at this brave independent woman\n\nKanye West comes out for Donald Trump\nHe's quote a token negro mentally ill and an Uncle Tom\n\nTell me how that's not jacked up\n\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to the Patriot mobile dot com phone lines are open Ben you're on the bench for August and show nice to have you with us and I go ahead\n\nOh quick things about this whole ... thing um\nYou're framing this and such a way that it sounds as if the left is calling Kanye mentally unstable just because she became a Republican support Donald Trump\nSoon as he started hanging out what let's be clear as soon as he started hanging out with Donald Trump or the ... back in two thousand sixteen when he met with him before he was inaugurated that's when the first political individuals' started saying well clearly he's mentally ill\nBecause that's a way to undermine someone and and and that's the reason why you would say that the same reason why all these democratic ah commentators\nAll of a sudden became doctors on national TV saying well clearly as mental issues clearly he has mental health problems clearly he needs to go ... you know seek mental health\nOr help from others clearly has frenzy to talk to him and it's all because he's saying something that they don't like when he said George Bush doesn't like black people after Hurricane Katrina remember that\nWhen he said George Bush doesn't like black people they said he was a hero they didn't need to go check himself in the mental health rehab\nWell let's look at the context of this most recent meeting where Tanya himself said that he's been diagnosed with bipolar\nDisorder that he is sleep deprivation and he was talking about alternate universes I mean what who would go into\nThe ... in contact in context what will in context what was he referenced the we talked about alternate universes\nHe ah I Can't remember exactly\nWho I can tell you it was talking about the politics of people living an alternate universes which I've said a million times that made it on my part in the shoes\nOf somebody else in an alternate universe and so on and so forth\n... though he will do that in politics all the time every politician that runs for office so I mean talk to you got Congressman Steve Cohen democratic congressman who has been screaming for Donald Trump to impeach said and I quote I vote with the conscience\nOf a black grandmother\nNo one said he was mentally ill when he said that over and over again why is running for office in fact you were cheered by the black community for saying that as a white guy who is Jewish you can't get any farther than that from a black grandmother\nStill seems like a bit of an abstract concept to be talking about when you're discussing things with the president when you could be focusing on policy ...\nOkay so here's what I'll say battle to I'm fine I'm fine if you don't like how the meeting\nWith okay if you think the meetings should have gone differently if you think the conversation should have gone differently I'm fine with that but don't you think it's incredibly you're responsible\nTo to bully and shame someone because of their
