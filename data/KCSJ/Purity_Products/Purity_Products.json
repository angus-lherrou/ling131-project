was out there but the difference because it doesn't have an organic components to it and let this\nOrganics get broken down by satellite so that's the problem with conventional paid and why is that the organic become or go to the sun and and you know get a degraded over time\nThis is all of silica basis all mineral based gel a ... gun through changes for thousands of years so um the the minerals don't the grade and the color that it could end it's not an organic solar\nShow it actually will stand up and they're just as I understand I've never used it\nBut my research indicates that ends up on the other side a lot longer I don't agree fifty years in Colorado maybe a bit of a stretch\nI sounds expensive but\nIt is more expensive but if you don't have to pay for quite a few years and it stands up their color or it might be worth it\nSure sure you know it was this guy and this email was asking about should we put a color in the ... or or not and and places like a Phoenix where they stucco virtually all the houses\nI'm a ... they they just great code the house and then when you come along and buy it they'll they'll paint it for you and I'm not sure what kind of paint they used to have to be honest with you but that's more common down there a is to paint stucco after it's been a a ban applies so you get to pick your pick your own color\nHum I appreciate the feedback on that it does sound expensive but I can I get the idea that the that the minerals would kind of bond with the underlying ... materials in kind of a ... they would all just kind of bond together versus lying on top makes sense doesn't it\nYeah it actually gets there was or by the by the concrete or the ... yeah so yeah it becomes part of the structure rather than just laying low income\nSleeves given me a

tissues and use a screw right through the carpet if you would like the most effective way though is to is to have if there's five or six places uh then I think it's good to have a carpet laying company or carpet installation company\nCome in and roll the carpet back and just start using decks screws either going to cost you a labor for the carpet a folks but if you want to foolproof way to do this but they're not going to return you get some three and a half inch deck screws and just walk these uh creeks down each floor Joyce\nUntil they quit so uh that's what I Would do you probably

Ninety KCBS Jay\nFive K. C. S. J.\n... dot com and on your own with our high hard radiolab\nHello and welcome to another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that's stressed and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nParkinson's osteoporosis and the list just goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the body\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing that really mess around with now what happens is that you need a magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and the cats sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the ah after you drink a cup of the comics formula\nInteresting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case study of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic type pen fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas that like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nMagnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they do\nTheir foot ... and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired\nMhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more rest or whatever right and that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting goal in life you start getting a muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest at\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and is and I'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researcher it how do you get this\nEnd of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because get that a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this\nPowder and mix it in yeah and you drink that's cut down this great ... is really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood strip\nAll right and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three not kill max is a unique blend up calcium and magnesium the gets absorbed into your blood stream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd want to let you know the doctor biggest has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to listeners so when you call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this is only available to listeners and only if you call this toll free number it's one eight hundred nine seven one\nTo nine nine three\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of sleep a low energy pain and stiffness and your muscles and joins your body is telling you is lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress you know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis do you want to prove your heart health your digestive health\nAnd human reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you try to kill max formula only have to do is pick up the phone and call one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three\nAnd when you do call today you're also going to get that free book it's called the user's guide to calcium and magnesium and folks in this book is packed with vital information about why your calcium needs change with age Cal seems rolling cardiovascular health osteoporosis diabetes depression fatigue it's all in this very informative book\nAnd I forget it I'm going to give away after my comment for your call partner for your listeners to pick up the phone and it can manage to that\nWill thank you for doing that Dr Pincus I really appreciate it folks and this just keeps getting better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to get that free book\nSo the number to call is one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three and remember you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael make us on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their\nBody well that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little trips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] not your bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take the comments formula many times they will calm your back paid well I Know I I a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back ... and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula and I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour\nI was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over ten day period yet at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah\nAnd if anyone had any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on this\nCow next formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond\nTo this and I recently gave a candidate\nTo a lady who was suffering from five of my object where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body it'd be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming\nAnd I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula and um she said she got a really good we go sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer may take it out to her friends\nThat's amazing and when I use is what the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relaxed shape\nWell you really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happening is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and and that add to that in the medication so\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium ... them in the system while the other very drugs that are trading the conditions that your body and experience and because of the fishing and ... and many of them is also blocking further absorption\nSomething so it's really it's really a rat race I think it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah you have nothing to lose\nBy folks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three now ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium that gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can

you again and uh we're going to be talking today on the show about lifeline and a ... rising people with what lifeline is and and really what an impact it's been for all of southern Colorado\nBut before we do that we have an annual event that you're sort of a really want to talk about today and what would that be\nThat event coming up is the eleventh annual safety of seniors conference sponsored by thirty a and their circle of friends and it's a great event we typically have about two hundred and thirty seniors participating in this event every year and it's coming up on September Eighteenth\nRegistration is going to start at eight thirty and we just had a sign that gay full as learning about and just safety information for seniors and a wide variety of information is going to be provided and a lot of time for people to ask any questions that they might have\nAnd we have about thirty vendors there that are going to provide a wide variety of information and so we would love to has as many people there as possible and we want to provide some great an education on safety\nFor great I remember when it was the first one ... I don't remember the first one\nAnd it was very unique because it was a smaller gathering but it was really about really are influencing seniors to come and to learn about safety and that's just kind of state that's kind of where this has been and a what a great event it's been through the years and it's nice to see a growing and people actively involved\nAnd it's a hoot just a lot of people there and so our goal today is to let you also know about it so those of you that are listening will want to come\nYes um [noise] I have some information on some of the speakers are going to have and this is typical for most years we will have the police department there\nUm which will be our first and our lungs talk and question and answer period we have chief Kevin ... coming and he will be in the program and out a little bit after nine o'clock and just go over some updating of safety um information and crime information in\nPueblo and then provide some time for anybody to ask any questions that they might have\nAnd then we also will have officer brand in both they they're um just to answer questions that anybody might have so that'll be a great way for people to start a conversation about anything they might be worried about and then um we have some other programs later on in the day that will get some specific safety\nAnd we have we live in a great community I'm at a lot of great support here\nAnd I think one of the one of the things that we often you know people get so comfortable in their in their life they get comfortable in their day to day and seniors you can just sort of lay down their guard a little bit\nAnd there are people out there that really want to take advantage of that I've done a number of radio shows are with our local law enforcement about fraud and\nThe and some of the types of things that that that are going on phone calls to our seniors and trying to build them out of thing and I and I and I I'm not trying to scare anyone but I think this was a great place to come just to Research Center\nUm how you live your life what you're doing just to make sure that the ... if you're living independently ... where you are that you stay very cautious\nTo your surroundings and and uh it it ... it always helps to have more education about what's happening in the local community so people are really come how much does it cost to go\nIt's free cell yeah it's free it's free and you get lunch and great entertainment as well so what a\nDeal so that's a the data this is going to be September Eighteenth yet and that's a that's a Tuesday

going all the way to Durango\nAnd and as you know Colorado would have it there are a lot of really a lot of extra credit you learn a little tiny towns and\nIt's really nice because that brings technology to your town that brings technology to wherever you are and whether you're in assisted living where they're going to independent living or at home or maybe you're living with your kids I

R. I. heart radio dot com\nAnd uh this is really the show about seniors and we talk about seniors were in our relates to southern Colorado but many of you are in other countries\nListening but our heart radio dot com and and you know what senior issues are senior issues all over the world I deal with seniors in Mexico Canada the u._k. South Korea and you know what the same story exists\nWith all of those marketplaces so I'm On the show here today with Andrea ... burger we're talking about is already a lifeline\nAnd the importance of of this particular service that's out there or southern Colorado\nWhich has been out there for a long time and how it really affects our senior so I ... thanks for for coming on and sharing this with uh our listeners we we kind of need everybody to be thinking about what's going on with mom or dad if something happens when no one's around\nDefinitely and and that's just that's a common issue that people don't think about these types of things that can really help seniors um stay independent and tell\nThey're in desperate need something to help because an incident happened and and so now that they finally realized that mom or dad needs help then they're seeking these services out we want to make sure people are aware of the services before anything serious were to happen on our mom and dad is injured\nAnd and so that's why we have lifeline and me\nPromote it to the community and that's why I Would I Do because on that the thing that everybody wants to be as independent as possible matter what your ages and I'm\nWith the ... when you grow in Asia you you can have some issues that might lead to falls\nUm and the major thing with the fall is that you might not be able to get up and the longer that you lay there after a fall and the way she could be injured\nAnd you know I think the scary part is is that those of us in senior care\nThat we see that it sneaks up on people oh mom is fine dads are driving around and nobody's even thinking about this until there's a fall off the porch fall down the stairs something happens and that fall is catastrophic and changes everything mhm and so you know false are going to happen but\nI'm a real advocate of the lifeline program because look around the neck it's it's it's it's something that\nYou have and if you fall you're not going to be wondering uh in six hours from now who's coming to visit me you you know you have that immediate response and I think the sons and daughters just need to think about we may think mom and dad's doing great\nBut they may have fallen and not told you and once we get into falls you know they can they can happen in series and then one day the fall is really the number one cause of why people die so that this is such an important topic and and this was a pretty affordable system isn't it ...\nIt definitely is and when you're considering um possible possible hospitalizations I'm from a fall and especially laying there for a long time and it's definitely something that you can be proactive with an an affordable product and that can help keep families face and keep ... parents at home longer and independent\nAnd help the children feel more confident that mom and dad are safe at home and they don't have to worry so much because they know that if they were to have a fall that and that it's just that push the button and they can get help\nAnd actually we do have a son and units that have father catching him so with that technology even if somebody were to fall and hit their head and be able to push a button and it's very accurate and get in determining a fall and will call for help\nAnd even if a button isn't pushed so and that's just said\nThat's really great for under fifty bucks a month mom or dad can still live at home even though you've got concerns about that they could still live at home they can get some help on the side\nBut if that helps not there no one's around that they do fall for under fifty bucks a month you know you're really given them that independents that they're really seeking and then after that of course you've got to you know you've got to try to mitigate that for the future but what a what a great program and and and talk about the apparatus what is it is it big as it small\nAnd it's not bad and and the one with the fall detection has to be one around that then neck\nAnd because that's how it detects the fall we do have some buttons that can be more in on the arrest and those are mostly for people that are more and just an ad in the home and buy themselves sometimes and aren't really going out and about um without somebody with them\nAnd but with the ones around the Napoli has some that actually are on mobile devices that people can take with them anywhere and they have all detection and on and and if they were his fall if they were at the grocery store or out for a walk in the neighborhood\nAnd it would detect that fall or they can push a button and and it has GPS locating in it so that and help with the able to find them where they are\nOkay so somebody wants to this is something that you know maybe a need for my mom and dad how do I get it set up how hard is it to get it set up a mountain so\nIt's it's very easy and again you can just call the same number that you call for that the senior conference that's I mean my my number it's five for five when she went to kill and\nAnd just give us your name information and we will just figure out what kind of and questions that we need from asking some kind of questions to get the information that we need 'em to get you all set up and our service reps are all local so that they couldn't get out there and probably the next day and get my my dad set up\nAnd so it's a very easy simple process and to get\nDid it plugs into the phone I mean they just have to connect it right so that it uses the phone system to be able to call so as long as there is a technical person they're they come to the home when they get that all set up so mom and dad are in good shape and that's ... that's the whole deal here yeah this is good so\nIf some of you avoided this and I know people don't want that added monthly fee and\nYou know oil I think I'll pass on that I'll just hollowed out for the neighbor\nYou know I've heard all sorts of stories about that and I think it's really something that you need to think about so given that phone number one more time this was lifeline but they get something that you all should consider\nIt's five for five one two one two\nThat's great well this has really been a I think an important part of our community that is really stretch started out in Pueblo\nTwenty six years ago and now look at it going all the way to Durango\nAnd as you know Colorado would have it there are a lot of really a lot of extra credit you learn a little tiny towns and\nIt's really nice because that brings technology to your town that brings technology to wherever you are yeah and or whether you're in assisted living whether you're in an independent living or at home or maybe you're living

[noise]\nHello and welcome to another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host press McCain I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress\nOr even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus is going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr bank is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural in alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns of Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThey Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we called mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose is the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up in traffic and everyone feels that and they're in the upper back in ... right and the doctor I'm more\nConcerned about the muscles that you don't feel that she has the muscles in the arteries oh that guy ended up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved but it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nHealth and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurts more\nPretty so it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering from pain and active roses and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has\nTo do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many ... it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones\nWell yeah OK yeah and it does build your ...\nBut he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones if it needs it\nThat's right I think and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that the fact and twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of about\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure district milk just drink milk or you know you'll out a green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but\nFirst of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian who they're irradiated um the calcium as leach from the soils and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food\nStore drug maker right but these things don't absorb and the body that's happening\nFor a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say at antacid that has the cows they met like Tom's first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment\nBut see what happens when you take a Tom isn't antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences that isn't\nA powdered and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system wow\nSo that's a problem that well\nYeah because when calcium and museum or a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fast absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications you need sleeping pills the calcium and especially the magnesium being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy combat formula does absorb incredibly\nIn the body the thing is is that when you take my comments formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people are ready to the doctor because I Can't believe it thirty minutes after the ... pain in my wrist went away or I was able to sleep for the first time an IRS mean this is really amazing\nI Want

vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that mechanisms

call to thirtieth going\nWow and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nLet me tell you my own story so over the summer I didn't take as much you might see three has actually traveling and I ran out of it\nSo what happened to me that you know I'm basically a pain free but all of a sudden I started having pain in my hand and go what is this this is weird but then I realized that I'd run out of ... formula and I went off of it for several weeks and I'm the minute I started\nGoing on and it took about seven maybe eight days the pain went away\nWow crazy isn't it\nThat's how you know somebody's working right if you stop and the health issues come back well there's your answer\nThat's the best tests that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence\nYou go I Wonder if this is really for me and what I Would do it the next time you give out the number to have people order as it's called ... in order it I Know you mentioned it's a risk ... go ahead and try yourself and stay on it for five six weeks and then I don't doubt it then go off of it and see if anything gets worse\nAnd again folks that want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nThen as we've been talking about Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a staff dissolving melt that's available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid results and by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have a bolstered immune system improved balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains and keep in mind folks Dr paint gives his arranged a very special offers it's only available to you listeners so when you do call be shared a mentioned this program and\nYou'll

if you call right now you qualify for an extra free supply with your order to keep yourself or share it with a family member or friend but\nYou must call now because this special radio off or is not available in stores or on line so the number to call is one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nAnd keep in mind you have absolutely nothing to lose here because Dr ... vitamin D three formula is guaranteed to be safe and effective or your money back\nAnd when you do call and order you'll not be enrolled in any of those monthly subscription programs as a one time order folks so the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three [noise]\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements\nJoining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and occupying is what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly it's not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nThat what I'm saying for instance a multifaceted problem where one we're not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ...\nVitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and I honestly it surprises me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the ball and we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first\nTwenty something years I practice I never prescribed vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nCan you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D or from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading this study you know I I kind of pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of shift in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the her but you know you're young raise and and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers an inside and I went home I though it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength can you do three formula help with that yeah\nIt's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nYou're seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down first it's kind of a ... that people kind of feel like they're getting slums they physically and then at the lack of flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel it at night especially if you're in bed\nRole in from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that sets this setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula\nSo if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain bone pain muscle pain fibromyalgia I Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nSo of course that Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you take it what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically so it's kind of like the only in a little bit younger Chris\nAnd who would I and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamin D three and he went back in three months later and his blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... says vitamin D three formula is a fast dissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid result in by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have a bolstered immune system improve balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains\nAnd again keep in mind that Dr ... says arranged a very special offered that's only available to your listeners today so when you do call please be sure to mentioned this program and you're going to get a risk free trial of Dr ... says vitamin D three again this is only available to your listeners\nAnd only if you call this toll free number it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nPlus if you'd call right now you also qualified to receive an extra free supply with your order today to keep yourself or share with a family member or friend\nBut you must call right now because the special radio offer is not available in stores or on line so that number to call is one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nIf your state if your vote get all the facts visit stepped into your\nJudge dot com bust or by the Colorado office of traditional performance evaluation Colorado processors

today is brought to you by visiting angels and the other five votes are now fears heroes neighboring early [noise]\nGood morning and welcome to the senior living today show the show above seniors for seniors and those of us it loved them on your o.s day returning again\nThis weekend on news talk five ... case he is Jay\nAnd I hurt radio and loved to have you join us we've got the topics that affects seniors all over the globe this is the longest running showed America so we are glad that you're with us and today we're going to be a a talking about something very interesting and uh\nUh typically when we age we sometimes withdraw from the things that we love and we think we're no longer useful\nAnd I've got a special guest that's going to tell you otherwise and so there are great opportunities out there we used to justice and who's a coach for entrepreneurs source is with us and we're going to talk about if you're a senior there are some great opportunities to continue to understand who you are\nWhat you are and make sure that you could be out and do something exciting good morning Lisa great to have you on the show\nGood morning Dave I'm so excited to be here good to have you here and I think this topic is just wonderful for us and and uh hey I'm sixty one hey I'm I'm a family or we go\nAnd uh we're the kind of aging folks that are that need to listen to the store so\nWell good let's let's find out a little bit more about what you do and then we'll talk about how our listeners can relate to what it is you specialize it\nAbsolutely I'm an alternative career coach I'm with the entrepreneurs source there from that's thirty four years old with coaches located across North America and I have an office here in southern Colorado in Pueblo and I work with people locally including in Colorado Springs Pueblo and\nI'm canyon city and so forth but I also work with people a nationally and I get to have the opportunity of actually working with people on their dreams looking at possibilities option and dreams\nCreating a life that they've always wanted and looking for self sufficiency and financial freedom you know Seventy five percent of the adult population Dave desires to be self sufficient um however\nMany of us don't know where to start including me up until several years ago I always wanted to be self sufficient independent but I didn't know where to go so I get to work with people who want to go on a journey of discovery\nSo you never too old to become an entrepreneur\nI was I was in my early fifties and actually it looked like\nThe worst thing in the world it happened to me I'd been with a fortune five hundred company actually they were in the top twenty uh and had been with them for twelve years very successful had a multi state team\nAnd uh the company decided to go in a new direction and so my position across the enterprise was eliminated and so here I was with this company that's a hundred and sixty years old thinking I'm safe\nYou know nothing's going to happen here I'm going to have my benefits I'm if I wanted to retire here I could uh I'm going to keep stacking up that four one K. and then lo and behold\nThey eliminated all of the people in my position and got rid of the position and distributed our responsibilities to I'm younger less tenured people and so I sat there and thought\nWell my gosh if this could happen at this point in time right is it safe to go back into these\nCorporations that you feel like I'm you're going to stay with forever and earn that golden parachute so to speak\nAnd so this was great for you a new career and coaching\nPeople helping them find of the special qualities the experiences that they have to enable them to the you know sort of walk with them while they're broadening their capacity and broadening their perspective\nUsually when these things happen\nThen it's a window of reflection at the time when people are looking and saying\nWhat else is out there and they start to look at those those dreams of being their own boss and doing their own thing and believe it or not there are so many people our age that this is happening to them in the traditional vehicle of having a job and working for a corporation\nUm often times they've been very successful and then something happens with the the company and they're going to go their own way and their position is eliminated and they're sitting there going oh my gosh\nThey've got gas in the tank you've got so much experience they have so many skills and so I get to work with people\nWho want to nurture their dream of being their own boss and being financially independent\nThat's exciting for those of you are listening I mean\nA lot of times we get compartmentalized in our in our daily operations you know you look at southern Colorado and many people were raised with the bill and yes or you've been working for the company and you know there's been so many changes because\nThere are just like leaves a story where the company made of a giant change that affected her so many of us in our fifties and sixties or know affected by Corp stretch they look even have a discussion of terrorists you know and and and those downstream effects of taxation can cause a company to change strategy\nOvernight absolutely you know and that happens so frequently now I mean there there was in America's history you know up until forty years ago people stayed with the company for fifty years and they had pensions\nAnd those pensions than afforded them a lifestyle when they left the company that was similar to when they were working on the seventies for one case took over and they were meant to supplement\nThe pensions but they ended up taking over and you know fidelity came out with a report saying that forty eight percent of people our age basically boomers from fifty for all the way up to Seventy four\nHaven't socked away enough to retire comfortably and so um you know looking at that realm of going the corporate route you can do it again but there's no guarantee that\nThat you're going to be there that you're going to be safe because the companies can go in a new direction and it is very commonplace now that they balance the books by eliminating positions and my ... my joy is telling people\nTheir other way you know you can come and explore being your own boss and you can do it in a safe Rome where there's no obligations and there's no risk and you know our group our generation wants to do that Dave and ...\nAnd they want to still be productive I mean this is the generation that created the term workaholic and I don't want to lay down and go you know work on their golf swing I mean at least not the majority of the days\nYou know it's funny too because I'm a the diesel retirement and that whole discussion of ... because when it was uh when it was about corporations people really were focusing on retirement no you talk to seniors you talk to people that are in their sixties seventies\nEven eighties there not retiree they're staying doing what they love and then when you do what you love you live longer and and that's the ... the way that people are looking at it now\nAnd ... and you know the really neat thing is about perhaps up until now it's like what we call you one point out kind of like research and development maybe you've hone those skills and develop new talents by going the route of working for a corporation I did for Thirty years I worked with Lou chip\nFortune five hundred companies and I hand my leadership by hand my skills I learned so much but when this window reflection\nWhich was forced open on me you know I didn't know it on my own it cost me to look at my dream of be my own boss and owning my own business and then I actually went through this discovery this journey of discovery with another coach\nShe took me under her wing and she goes let's nurture that dream of doing your own thing and USA Today said that sixty percent\nOf the baby boomers don't want to retire and that makes so much sense because think about the ... 'cause that was in this generation that generation I mean you know\nGoal oriented Japan or an independent right making things happen and they don't want to just lay down their ready to go and the and the great news is that you know you can't have an opportunity to get back and look at that dream of being self sufficient through business ownership\nWell there's a really good discussion ... the vehicle for me as I\nAs I was changing careers the vehicle me for me was franchising yes and so when as many of you know uh I own the visiting angels franchise here in southern Colorado for about sixteen years\nDon't ever know but I'm Still a corporate executive with the visiting angels corporate team and so that vehicle of franchising is a very good vehicle for people our age\nTo get involved with the system works the people that can help you and you just have to\nLet people like Lisa help you find out what is it I really want to do because that's the big question isn't\nIt is the big question and one of the things that that the coaching session does is that we don't want it to find you a job we don't want to get you another job we will find we want to find a vehicle\nThat's wonderful to because you've reached a point of clarity\nIs right and I'm Talking to your listeners right now because a lot of you are my age and many of you are older\nAnd you're thinking hey man I'd done it's all washed up I waited for Social Security and the bottom line is you know we have entrepreneurs out there that are ... that are running ... companies I'm slowly or people that are just starting at my age of sixty one they're just starting ... and they'll be doing that for Twenty years as long as you're alive\nSo it really is never too late to discover\nWhere your gifts are absolutely any now are expected life\nIs eighty five years old now I mean so what are you going to do with that time and think about things like leaving a legacy for your kids I mean what if you want it to you know and ... well this was the big thing that I thought about my daughter\nIs entering her senior year of college and I've been talking to her I was talking to her last year oh my gosh you're halfway there you know you're going to be senior these are the wonderful things I can see you\nTraveling the world and you know she's a photographer a photo journalist is a journalist and stuff and I said I can see you out there being a contract writer on travel around it and I was talking all these dreams\nAnd I was applying for positions\nThat made me go to sleep when I thought of him and I thought hey what about our dreams\nAnd how we telling our kids you go live the dreams in the life that you want and yet we're sitting here and what are we do eat where soccer if I were were settling day were settling for us you know and yet that that really let it only sign of always wanted to be\nGoing on it to be a business owner and when this elimination my position happened my eighty three year old mother\nWho had always heard my dream of being a business owner basically said well you better get on it it looks like this is your time\nThat's right that's right well tell you what if you're listening to the show right now I'm this may be a chance for you to just to think about is that me do I still have ... to become a business owner where to find out when we get back we're taking

there what's what's what are people looking at a service is what are some of your thoughts of it\nI'm slowly so you know for for this generation of fifty four to Seventy four you know they are like I said baby boomers goal oriented independent I mean these are the things they're known about and these are attributes that make people successful in business ownership\nDo a business model and you know some of the top five boomer friendly opportunities and why they make sense for people our age include things like how ... franchises and so how ... it ... the actual business runs the gamut I mean it could be staffing it could be\nCoaching ... it could be home inspection\nBut you know these things first of all baby boomers we went to work forever and goes corporate offices writing for some of us you know that's a that's a four letter word now corporate office because we are not happy anymore with corporations you know some having it in your home right\nBeing home base self it gives you flexibility if you are one of these people that have a\nSandwich generation you maybe have older people living with the older family members and also your younger ones is your flexibility on but also at least let you ramp up fast\nBecause you're startup cost is lower you don't have brick and mortar right you don't have the employee maybe you're the commodity All right and there's a variety of services that we have you know like you said it could be um it could be property management different things like that you bought\nA couple of ways I look at external people that are social their marketers their connector and then there's internal people which is just as valuable\nBut they're the people that do the crust and the ... the ... the detail work that all of us can't do and send it really kind of fall into those areas and it's people like use our heads people like to talk to people you know what I mean it's kind of an interesting gossip\nAnd just because it's that's how does that mean that it's um does it mean that they're sitting on the couch it could be that they're based at home but then they're out in the community ... another great one is tutoring\nThere are so many tutoring opportunities out there um where you go out and you pour into the next generation you know the baby boomers we're the ones that were right in the thick of the civil rights movement believing in empowering people and getting on\nAnother one is senior care franchises no that one you know that one very well known when the staffing in recruiting I mean this generation we were in the hiring we

of fear connected with that but that thing you can kick those walls though and that ball that box doesn't have to be a box we can be whatever you make it it could be as big as you want it to be and you just need people to encourage you through it\nAnd that's one of the the really neat things about the coaching experience that we offer you know we offer education about alternative vehicles\nOut there that you might not know about\nAnd we help you through that vehicle looking at things that maybe you you wouldn't have considered on your own or didn't even know about on your own you know there's thirty eight hundred business models out there in eighty five different industries you know people see the fast\nFood ones and they think oh that must be the only thing that some franchising\nBut you know that that's only like seven or eight percent of all franchises and um I mean there's just so many opportunities\nAnd then we also offer awareness we're going to look at things like what's important to us what's important in our age you know we might want the flexibility we might have a grand kid at home or we might have our parent at home and so maybe we want the flexibility to work from home\nAnd so that we can be around to help out\nOur wonderful family members\nBut also do our business it could also be that you want flexibility\nRight to determine your own schedule so what we do is we look at awareness about what's really important to you and then we go on a journey of discovery and what we do is we get you in touch with people\nWho have the lifestyle income and wealth and equity that you want and then we have you talk with them in a safe environment so that you could see how they did it and see if it's an option for you\nThat's really great but we're talking with Lisa ... from entrepreneur source of she's a coach and\nHey we're thinking big picture today so if you're listening to this you're living today show and you're the you're sort of

really right up my alley we used to justice and is a is as a coach and she helps you through a ... D printer source\nTo discover what it is that amber that burns for something to do that's unique to what your gift to do that takes your experience\nThat takes ... you know the the resource of time which is much more valuable to the resource of money but the resource of time and helps us to point towards accomplishing something that really resonates in our in our lives is that I say that right Lisa\nOnly it's about nurturing that that dream those possibilities options of being self sufficient of being financially independent nurturing that dream of being your own boss in doing your own thing\nWe talked about being your own boss so let's let's go to ... so that we can broaden people's understanding of what's really out there I mean this guy is the limit\nIn in terms of franchising there are hundreds of them in many different sectors some of which you got to buy a big building for some of them you've got to serve food in many of them you can do from your own home\nAbsolutely you know there's thirty eight different models as we discussed earlier right and only eight to nine percent of them are ... are fast food but we think of that 'cause when we're driving around that's what we see but you know there's a lot of different models out there and I love what you talked about earlier when you when you think of what a franchise\nIs a business model and that includes things like licenses and distributors ships um you know it's basically what I call a system and if you think of the acronym s y S T e M save yourself significant time energy and money and that's one of the reasons why\nI Love this business is because people who want to take control their destiny can ramp up fast\nThey can really the go quicker because a business model has already been established to an audit of overtime tweaked in and brought up\nUm and there's just so many different things out there for people to look at and\nAs well said I mean it is a team sport and I've told so many people they said well I Want to do this business but I'm going to do it on my own yeah um and it takes sometimes three four times longer to do it yourself but it does to\nTo to get in capitalize it get a team working with you and take off fast and and that three or four years of time you use to grow something and you could do it in half that time you take a look at the resources that you pick up\nAnd the momentum that you gained so ... is a great way to fix or to interrupt\nYou know absolutely and you know doing start up completely from the ground up there are people out there that can do it and they're very successful at\nIt this is just a different model um for me it's about efficiency I have a I have a girlfriend that she can she can create a financial platform a marketing platform and operational platform you know an HR platform I mean she can do all that from the ground up and you know ... you know hats\nOff to her um but for me I'm like I\nTalk to him about a financial system oh my goodness no way I mean so so for me having these platforms and having them tweaked in audited and already that's what really that's what really is good and you know basically when you look at franchises people think that they have to have the technical skills Dave\nLike you were in visiting angels where were you a gerontology\nAir force officer and I'd never even been into a hospital where'd your pilot yeah well I did television shows for the year for I'm willing to fly but but you know what the system helps you to learn those skills\nAbsolutely and that's what people think they think that you have to have the technical skills but most of the time there's only two skills you really need to have success in a business model and run it well and that is managing operations and following a system and that's because\nYou know you're not always in the business you can be working on the business\nBut you know the really neat thing about it is that the clients that we work with and you know this is the meat thing there is no cost to work for me or work with me no cost whatsoever there's no arrest has no obligation I get to work with people all the time he just want to go on a journey of discovery to look at\nBusiness ownership and is it is that right for them is it the vehicle for them to get those possibilities options and dreams that Ninety five percent of the clients we work with\nGo online to in a business that they wouldn't have considered on their own war had looked at him prematurely dismissed\nAnd part of that is because they don't know everything else is out there and part of it is because we back into it we look at\nWhat are the things you want in income lifestyle wealth in equity we don't want you to buy a job yeah we want you to have the benefits that you want\nSo that's good I I think that you know this discovery process in everybody's life is the light bulb that comes on and you're sitting here saying you're willing to do this for free\nTo learn

referred to as the sunshine vitamin but folks here's the problem\nMany of us aren't getting enough sunshine lately between flattering on those powerful sunscreens in spending more time indoors and what it really comes down to is this vitamin D deficiency that's out there is causing an avalanche of health problems for Seventy percent of our population ranging from\nPain loss of balance muscle weakness depression increase blood pressure arthritis memory loss and even a compromised immune system and I have Dr Michael Pincus with me today to talk about the most effective way to get by to Monday Dr pay guess it's good to talk to you again\nIt's great to be back thank you\nYou know many of you know that Dr ... is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's a

the top Dr ... talk a little bit about what are some of the warning signs that you may be deficient in vitamin D\nOkay well tired of it is how you feel and one of the things Chris was being tired for no apparent reason okay\nBut on the river side of that I've seen that of lack of vitamin D affects your sleep\nOkay another big sign is that your bones ache now there's a lot of people listening who have been diagnosed with al ... which is a thinning of the ... ... but again a vitamin D deficiency\nA big one is muscle weakness so you try to get it from a couch you get in and out of a car and you're finding it more and more difficult and that's\nLeading to the high high prevalence of people fall in and injuring themselves\nOh okay All right which is a huge problem right exactly\nI Know that when you tend to get more calls especially upper respiratory problems okay problems with\nBlood pressure cardiovascular problems digestive problems consultation bloating gas ... it's very very common and if you're a diabetic there's all kinds of data about being deficient in vitamin D and the list goes on and on it's a huge problem what\nDoes vitamin D actually do in the body what is it used for\nWell when we use the word vitamin it's actually kind of a misnomer because vitamin D is actually a hormone okay and that regulates thousands of genes in the body everything from pain blood sugar immune system blood pressure falling string\nPlus ... has been linked to maintaining call and health brass cross\nAn ovarian health but I'll tell you what the way we're taking vitamin D is all wrong it's all messed up\nWell why do you say that why is it messed up\nWell first of all go to your doctor and they got a quick at a vitamin D supplements and it's like four hundred international ... which is totally worthless or God Forbid if you're listening right now and you're taking a multi vitamin and you'd think your clobbered\nThat's why you're on six or eight or ten different prescription drug I'll tell you that white now ...\nBecause your body is not getting enough the the other thing is that vitamin D is an oil you don't absorb oils and your body they're very difficult to digest okay I've come up with my own vitamin D which I call Dr focus the vitamin D three formula\nSo Dr bank is what makes your fast melt vitamin D formula so unique\nOh Chris first of all I foot five thousand

formula which is the carrier and readily available so your body can digest it and this is known as vitamin D three and a third my formula is a fast tablet that's available for immediate absorption\nYou know you mentioned the vitamin D is an oil so how were you able to make your formula into a fast melt\nWell good question Chris here's what I've done\nI've worked with an advance team of scientists and these guys they know their stuff and they're using this technology to convert vitamin D which is an oil into a dry powder and once they do that they put it in this vast dissolving melt for immediate absorption and quick results that you can feel\nWhat some of the feedback that you're getting Dr bank is from people that are taking your fast smell the three\nOh I'm getting tons of feedback you know I've got people that email me here's an email from Patty and she writes I was diagnosed with a severe vitamin D deficiency and she says she tried many other vitamin

you're trying to get vitamin D back in your body you're most likely taking the wrong type or the wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way and maybe not even getting enough of it\nAnd documenting is why don't we start here by talking about you know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all of the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country\nAre deficient in vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and it's not there\nAnd the statistics

that's trapping toxic\nAnd corrosive films inside the septic tank most\nFolks have a concrete tank a and there's a film is in there like hydrogen sulfide that when it gets wet and gets damp it turns

hallway and I got one up near the ceiling and one near the floor and like I can as the time of year what season it is\nLike walking the air on one of those return air vents off you know depending on the the the weather\nSo you have I just want to read state this and get it in my head here you have a floor level return it directly above it you have a mother colder return on the upper part of the wall\nI yeah exactly\nYeah I I Would probably leave them alone the more Airflow the better actually through that for him as a viewers I think they did that to facilitate air conditioning because we want to suck more air you know through the system or in the summertime you Americans the central air Brandon\nYes I Do yeah so I think you have a a good system for central or I Would just leave them alone we just want to maximize the Airflow or through the furnace yeah you're fine okay I appreciate it\nYou got it yeah we don't want to block off return or a grills because it just limits that air flow across the heat exchange was Bryan was talking about and across the air conditioning coils in the summertime we do like to strategically locate return airs especially in the upper level main levels not as important as the basement many folks have a heat\nDucks are ... others of the fence you can open and close on the ceiling in the basement that's the most convenient place to put them and if that's the case then you are that you have a issue a with getting the heat\nDown at Flora level where you actually sit and watch TV and so on and so we need to return on the floor for sure in a basement so that he comes out of the ceiling goes down and across\nAre you in the furniture and everything in into the cold air return on the floor level or in the upper and a levels we have the heat fence on the floor\nAnd so we have returned to err err on the floor which is fine but in Brandon's case there's a ... there's some return or a high up in the wall which again results in that cross circulation\nSo that's the best that you have the best of both worlds brand and I would not block any of those off 'cause you're sure want to maximize the Airflow summer\nAnd fall and winter sometimes it's just a matter of circulation\nYou know it's a hot summer day you come home from work turn that furnished fan on to run all evening long and that'll circulate the warm air out of the upper level and suck up through the furnace to be mixed up with a cooler on the lower level\nAnd that way the temperature is moderate all throughout the house especially on a trial level or two story where it's hard to mix those air masses up anyway if you turn the furnace fan on\nIt all gets mixed together and shoved back through the furnace to be cool on a hot summer day so turning that for a new spin on\nA is a big benefit in the summertime when you come home safe four or five o'clock we've been on all evening\nLong be comfortable on hot summer for Michael thanks for your expertise and

not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying for instance a multifaceted problem where one we're not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ...\nVitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and I honestly it's surprise me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the phones we get enough being outside and in our milk and\nEnd of story right and for the first twenty something years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D or from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading study you know I I kinda pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of ships in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful ... young raise and and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers inside and I went home I though it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone string ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down for us it's kind of a ... that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility\nThat you start to stiffen up and you feel it at night especially if you're in bed\nRole in from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders hurt\nThat sets this set in and that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula so if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain bone pain muscle pain\nFibromyalgia I Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nSo of course that Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you take it is what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically so it's kind of like the only in a little bit younger Chris\nAnd who wouldn't want that right and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results are basing\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamin D three and he went back in three months later and as blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a fast\nDissolving melt which makes it available for

mountain standard time you can also hear aside I hurt radio so we love to have you joined us\nAll over the globe you just gotta make sure you're targeted the mountain standard type and you might have to get up at one of the morning\nBut we'd love doing the senior show or one of the oldest and longest running shows in the U.S for seniors and we always have a fun show for you and this weekend is no different and we're going to be talking with some great friends from Humanae brandy Johnson and also Sean modest\nAnd we're going to take a look at a at some of the some of the programs that they offer at ... welcome nice to have your brandy and Sean thank you thank you will come\nWell thanks for taking the time to to uh to come along you know I'm One of the things that are um I don't know too much about and I've seen Humanae I just really excited about learning more about what he meant it does\nAnd I know that you're both based out of Colorado Springs but you serve a larger area so tell us a little bit of humanity that how how you function the in this in this area\nAll right so Humanae is a complete Medicare company we also um [noise] are so Brandi and I are both full service eight years so we cover all products\nSo that's where we come in and we actually live here in ... Colorado and we branch out so we were technically work from home or work\nAt home to okay with the home office get up in the springs to cover that larger that larger peace\nCorrect yeah so you man has been in business for over fifty years ah they started out in the\nNursing home business they kinda branched out purchased hospitals kinda got through that side of it and started working into the Medicare realm\nOr that allowed them to start out getting Medicare Advantage Medicare supplements prescription drug plans and then they brought us agents and where we actually do the whole spectrum you know life health and duties everything\nYeah I didn't I didn't know how large this spectrum really was so brainy what uh so what kinds of products are you do you handle specifically amount or do you kind of handle everything\nWell we we handle everything actually and we are full service insurance agents with Humanae that's what we call ourselves and on our business card and then you'll see it and it says\nUm service agent or sales agent we're not here just to sell people things were actually here to\nEducate people on health and wellness you man is a health and wellness company a lot of people don't realize that either so we offer a lot of different programs that are not just Medicare and not just dental and vision not just life insurance but we also try to educate our community as well\n[noise] well that's that's really important part of the show it's really educating our listeners\nTo what's out there but one of the things that that I think when I look at this topic is is that\nWe don't plant enough um if you're a senior in your aging or your son or daughter oftentimes we don't react like we should until there's an issue and then you wonder well I should have known about that or I should have done that earlier\nAnd so is that something that you both run into a lot when you're talking to families about uh any one of these issues is is it really bringing people up to speed and letting them know that now's the time to do this um how does it work for you\nSure um we have we had a lot of confusion especially when we say the N word Medicare yeah of course and a lot of people aren't sure what to do so that's what we're here for in the community to educate and and start planning for if you're sixty\nYou you need to think about when you're turning sixty five you needed to start thinking about those things now what's going to be available for you and what are your options going to be\nYeah you want to make sure if you're a veteran you have if you're a veteran benefits or you want to make sure how that last or I guess you could say the last quarter of your life is going to play out\nUm unfortunately we do run into where we're doing\nA life meeting and nobody's looked at their life insurance plan for Twenty years ago I got one no big deal well who's your beneficiaries poll loophole the plans outlook at him\nUnfortunately make sure they're not to know accidental plans because we run into it all the time was an accidental insurance plan accidental\nYou know I don't I never made it gave me this years ago and I want to have it\nYeah it's an accidental death so that we're OK yeah sorry they they actually have two accidental death policies where they don't pay out unless you die from an accidental death right where you know they're thinking they had life insurance and as soon as you know mom or dad passed where we're going to be able to help pay for this funeral or what ever happened\nAnd unfortunately it doesn't so we always do a review and we make sure we tell everybody pull it out at least every five years make sure you're beneficiaries are where you are make sure nobody has any cognitive issues where they can't make any decisions anymore we\nNeed to change those beneficiaries we'd do all that and then well so do the Medicare review to where we okay do you have your everything's set where you need to get your Medicare\nWow so random when you go in a unit appointment um do you have you have so many umbrellas here we're talking about I mean this is there's a lot of different facets that\nHumanity does do you usually get called in to a meeting on one specific bastard or when you're called in by a family to sort of do I'm a big review of their entire situation\nNormally it it well it depends on the situation of course but um a lot of people will call essence they we have no idea what next we don't know what to do this just happened or that just happened to her hand turning sixty five and two months and I don't know what the heck I'm doing so at\nThat point Medicare appointments or Medicare appointments were not allowed to actually talk about other policies like life insurance during those appointments\nSo that's why we're here it's too not just gets you set up on on one type of insurance but we also follow up with you and we become your agent basically to help guide you through the life insurance policies and help guide you through ... dental and vision even\nYeah and and and I can and I can sense that there's when you negotiate this sort of labyrinth\nOf of information that sometimes we get compressed I mean I'm sixty one I'm all of a sudden for the first of all my life thinking you know what not only do I get a Happy Meal certain restaurants but I'm going to be up for a Social Security itself I got to think about that\nAnd then I got to think about this Medicare thing and how does that all tie and to me and it's a little overwhelming and I think\nUm I sort of look at you when you're in your chapter of your sixties maybe you should be looking that in the chapter of your fifties and maybe I'm a little late and so this is another reason this is a good show for me just because I Want to know what's out there what I should be considering and it's nice to know that you have boundaries too you know you go in and although\nLook here we are you slap Eighteen thousand pamphlets on the ice age we're here to serve you you know and I think it's a good way to go is to is it really kind of take people down he let's review where you are let's take a look at how you're feeling about\nYour process your aging some of us expect a ... a short a timeline of life some people are going to be on an escalator for a long long long time and so that really does change things up or is that ... is that how you approach this\nYeah when when we go in you know we may have a Medicare climate so we go in\nWe do a full we do a full review saying okay what what makes you not sleep at night you know are you worried about things are you worried about this and that's where we'll condense down to products and say okay these are the three that will helps sleep yeah help you sleep\nBetter do most of your business come from friends and family members who refer people because they know that they need some help\nOr do you or or is it when you're out in the community you just you just kind of happened to run into people's this'll referrals sort of thing where people in Pueblo should be telling their friends about a program like this and for sure and uh having people pursue it\nAbsolutely and it's kind of funny because our friends and family are actually the ones that are the hardest for us to talk [laughter]\nSo they are great at referring people to say hey brandy and Sean can help you out but they don't really listen to us very well our friends and family don't but we also work with the VSW with low income housing units we work with\nAll of the doctors in town and in southern Colorado we are in our doctors' offices and talking to our our physicians and and their staff saying hey this is what we can do and\nThat's kind of how we get our referrals and people come in and say hey I heard you that you didn't just do Medicare you also do life insurance or you also do hospital plans or even short term home health care what\nI Want to term care insurance do you guys stay away from that product or do you embrace that\nLong term care is pretty pretty cumbersome and is pretty expensive after a certain age or so there's a lot of avenues to kind of stare around instill implement or in bed the long term care\nOr you can do that with the ... and you can embed like a long term care writer so you're not losing your money is still run you know if you were to go to long term care then it's going to\nTurn on well that's the there's a lot of care that I've seen is there's no brake pedal on it you know I don't get it when you're fifty and it's like you could see increases that could literally drive you out of the marketplace yeah so I Know that there are some other instruments and not the not that we want to spend the show talking about those but\nCertainly life insurance annuities um and one of the things that I think people right now are confused about is look how do we handle the the the rising costs and your experts in that and so that's another reason for\nThe defense team yeah yeah because you're going to see things coming that we don't see and I are still sort of amazed at how complex\nThis whole this whole system is showing how 'bout you what if what if some of the challenges similar or do you if you walk in and you've dealt with families I'm getting there do you think getting their affairs in order maybe one of the big things people need to think about\nI think affairs in order huge because we'll all my kids can just throw me outside or my kids can pay for things and you're going\nNo ... I bet you if we made a phone call they probably say how much is it what do we need to do so um but yeah I I Would say truthfully we're all used to a corporate world where we have an HR person that says here you need this take this\nWhere we all retired and all of a sudden we're going what do I do where do I go that's where you could say brandy and I are your age are person 'cause we can help direct even I I'm a big believer even if you didn't picky man at least we helped you make a good choice in what you're going to do next right or where to plant and what to do\nYou need a strategy James ... so I think this is a great discussion and ah they were going to ... uh come back and just a few moments in a kind of close out the show and we'll give you the overview to Humanae now you're listening to the senior living today show we'll be right back after these are ... so don't go away\nSometimes in our lives we need a little help\nWhether it's you or a loved one consider visiting angels to provide the personal care you deserve visiting angels has been serving southern Colorado since two thousand and has been selected a nationwide home care leadership and excellence award for twenty fourteen and\nTwenty Fifteen from one to twenty four hours a day visiting angels provide your loved ones with experience caregivers to provide the love and companionship to keep you in the place that you love the vest with hygiene transportation meals and like housework\nAnd you'll appreciate the longstanding better Business Bureau rating of a plus\nSo when it's time for you to get a little help call visiting angels at five four\nThree forty two twenty five four three four two two zero or go to visiting angels dot com for more information\nNow laughing services like ... or ... or other actors provide bouncing around ... tried to match their prices but it's a\nQuality behind ... professional uh personalized service important for when victims are their loved ones there really is no match for now ... trained to Montgomery and they were had remained a rare that compound ownership on operation means a lot but it's not for being located in our\nCommunity the town actor then [noise] go to Montgomery there were a dot com ...\nAnd now back to the senior living today show with your host David Early on news dot five Ninety Casey as J.\nA. thanks for joining us today on the senior living today show we're coming down the home stretch\nThis is day return on your host and I'm a news talk five Ninety Casey us Jay every Saturday morning at eight thirty\nAnd usually on Sunday is it ten so I'd love to have you join us a\nRight here in southern Colorado or around the world on my heart radio dot com just go to ... find Casey as Jay and you can hear us for ever you may be that we're talking with Randy Johnson is Sean modest from Humanae and we're talking about some of the programs they offer as we\nAs we kind of wrap up the show one of the things we wanted to talk about was veterans and there's a lot of veterans in this area how can you impact them\nSo we always kind of try to meet our first question on both of our laptops are you a veteran\nEveryone goes why why do you ask well because there's other benefits that may be available to you that you may not know about um plus Randy just did a stand down where we did the homeless veterans gave him haircuts clothing\nUm counseling services there was one in there for you know how to buy a house or so um so there's multiple as to what we can help do for veterans I had a veteran call or a veterans son call me asking about you know hey my my father just passed away what do I need to do to get his service taking care of\nColumbia so this is where we need to go there you go and so we we help on that and and we have the\nConnection is eight and attendance programs I mean there really are a lot of veterans services available many of us who are veterans didn't even really know about correct until just in the last few years there's been a lot of uh shined a light on that so look if you have a loved one that's a veteran or you don't give these folks to call I think this would be that should be a a great way to go\nI'm so Randy Johnson is showing motto let's give out your information so that people could get a hold of you and you maybe help a guide them a little bit\nCake so Sean modest I cover public Kenyan\nAll the way through ... up and down and most of that that's my pretty much my main territory or footprint are the best phone number to reach me seven one nine to three seven four or five one nine or just to do a consultation see if there's anything else that you may be missing have no no fees no requirements and\n...

dot five Ninety Casey as Joe they were\nBack in the senior living today show the show about seniors for seniors and those of us that loved them I'm Dave ... here at news talk five Ninety Casey us Jay and uh we enjoy doing the show with you I'm here in the studio with Randy Johnson\nAnd also showing modest from humanity and it's great to have you both on board and we have to talk a little bit here about short term healthcare insurance but before we do I want to thank our sponsors of the show\nVisiting angels a problem for us sponsoring the show as well as Montgomery and Stewart funeral directors great companies and a few need those services we'd sure encourage you to to use them\nAnd when we're talking about a short term home healthcare insurance is up you know that's a subject that we don't really uh we\nDon't want us when we're going to need it it sort of catches you off guard but I think it's really a great discussion uh to to to have in terms of what's available out there and what should we be thinking about and maybe many of us are unaware that this even exists so give us a little over a view on what this is\nWell most Americans like to recuperate in their own home or from hospital stay or in a nursing facility stay and so Humanae\nHas actually partnered up with ... which is guaranteed trust it's a great company it's been around for ... years and we are offering this new short term home healthcare insurance to cover you while you're at home to cover\nA home health care home health care aide even with benefits for prescription costs as well as hospitals stay um coverage\nSo ... so it's so it's a wide wide birth of a lot of items that are put into a policy like this um it's probably ... is this something new or that that you're that you're offering has this been out there for a long time\nNo this is actually new within the last couple of months that's new to new within our portfolio I guess you want to say ah there's probably a few other companies out there but knew the Humanae we've been doing this for a month you know after training and going over but over a month and people are actually liking that\nYou know hey I get paid back for prescriptions that I'm taking\nA which most of us take at least one or so\nAnd then it's also going to cover it depends on what you look at and how much you want and you kinda can build your own kind of like a big you know happy ... my way like to I Want this or that so you can put in the hospital stay it comes with the basic short term healthcare but you can add pieces to it to help cover your gaps in your insurance coverage\nOkay good so it's very customized double it sounds like and that's kind of what is that where a lot of products are going in the future to to give people better choices and and there seem it seems to be complicated so this kind of fills those holes right\nRight it does it does cover those gaps in care\nBut it also like Shawn said a lot of us are taking medication this policy is actually for any one forty years old and older not just the sixty five Medicare people so uh this this covers some co pays for you and and a lot of us that take medication every day we're all paying a co pay almost every month\nIn the big picture um are the changes from Obamacare a ... there's a lot of high level stuff\nOut there and maybe we don't even want to go down that road because I I think none of us really know and maybe you don't either all where this is all going and so you know a lot of times you're just trying to to to to provide products that really meet the needs of the of the clients white here in southern Colorado\nThat that that need so yeah we'll avoid that subject but I think you know where where it's all going I'm sure you we all scratch our heads and and maybe you know he met his no different you try to you know to continue on this track 'em in the time that we have\nI Do want to talk about some of the supplements and Medicare and I must admit I'm One of those that I don't know a lot about it\nBut the the Medicare ... supplements I think are valuable could you can you what have you explain that to where we position is in our families and our futures [laughter]\nSo that's where we as agents branding I go in and we make sure so the first thing is what you know like I said before what keeps you up at night while I'm worried about hospitals I'm worried about these so we'll do that needs analysis so supplemental are what they are\nYour Medicare is going to pay first or even your individual and then you're supplemental insurance is going to come in and pay what's leftover or depend on the plan what small co pays you may have or out of pocket you may have\nUm [noise] you know does range from there's got from a through and\nSo those are quite a few out there that you can kind of look at it and very they're very him priced too so\nYou may be paying your Medicare premium plus you have to pay that supplemental premium and that's where a lot of families may not be able to afford that bigger premium so then at that point that's where we go okay well let's look at this other option which may be Medicare Advantage\nAnd I think brand you can cover Medicare Advantage is a little bit more on that side\nYeah in with with the supplements to you also have to have a prescription drug plan a lot of people\nAnd we run into they were like why do we even I don't take medication I don't want him a prescription drug plan\nA lot of people don't realize that Medicare penalize if you if you did not get a prescription drug plan when your Medicare start and that penalty goes for life so it's kinda scary to think about but that's where the Medicare Advantage comes in and we kind of put everything

talking about it in between here and yes it has hit the industry fewer buyers are actually making purchases across the country\nAnd we're saying how how much of that is because of the interest rate so

today as we explore and discovered the secrets to health wealth in better living and if you're a long time listener\nNow let me ask you this doctor bank is how can you fast melt the three formula help boost your immune system\nVitamin D is responsible for two hundred different chemicals\nThat your immune cells produce to fight off bacteria and viruses\nListen if you're someone that susceptible to having any type of called fluke I Would start right now taking one of my vitamin D three miles every day and one of the nice things about this is that the size of your immune system being fat or\nYou'll find your energy better you'll find less pain less arthritic type pain more mobility flexibility better muscle strength and if you're someone who is concerned about falling it'll have better balance and a better sense of walking which is so important is that\nSo and and how do you take a doctor because\nYou can take it in the morning you could take it at night you don't need water and you're putting your mouth and you know maybe ... to thirtieth gone\nWow and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nLet me tell you my own story so over the summer I didn't take as much you might see three I was actually traveling and I ran out of it\nSo what happened to me that you know I'm basically pain free but all of a sudden I started having pain in my hand I Know what is this\nThis is weird but then I realized that I'd run out of ... and I went off of it for several weeks and I'm the minute I started going on and it took about seven maybe eight days the pain went away\nWow crazy isn't it\nThat's how you know something's working right if you stop and the health issues come back well there's your answer\nThat's the best tests that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence Hugo I Wonder if this is really for me and what I Would do if you're at the next time you give up the number to have people orders is go had an order it I Know you mentioned it's a risk free offer and go ahead and try it yourself and stay on\nIt for five six weeks and then if you're still doubt it then go off of it and see if anything gets worse\nAnd again folks I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr ... says vitamin D three formula there's this special toll free number for you to call it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nAnd then we've been talking about Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a staff dissolving melt that's available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid results and by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have bolstered immune system improved balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains and keep in mind folks Dr ... says arranged a very special offers only available to you listeners so when you do call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of Dr ... vitamin D three\nAgain this is only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number it's one of eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nPlus if you call right now you qualify for an extra free supply with your order to keep yourself or share it with a family member or friend\nBut you must call now because the special radio off or is not available in stores or on line so the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three\nAnd keep in mind you have absolutely nothing to

subscription programs as as a one time order folks so the number to call is one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three I'll give it to you again it's\nOne eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three [noise]\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements\nJoining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying for instance a multifaceted problem where one we're not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ...\nVitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and I honestly it surprised me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the phones we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first twenty something years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands\nThe study started coming out and now there's over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on Monday or from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading study you know I I kinda pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of shifts in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful ... young raise and and they're developing\nSkin cancer but then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers inside and I went home [laughter] so it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down\nFor us it's kind of a ... that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel it at night especially if you're in bed\nRole in from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt and your legs are restless your shoulders hurt\nThat sets this in a setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula so if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain bone pain muscle pain fibromyalgia\nI Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it into your body\nOf course that Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you take what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically so it's kind of like family and a little bit younger trust\nAnd who wouldn't want that right and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamin D three and he went back in three months later and as blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... says vitamin D three formula is a fast\nDissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid results in by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body you're going to have a bolstered immune system improve balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains\nAnd again keep in mind that Dr ... says

running shows in the U.S for seniors and we always have a fun show for you and this weekend is no different and we're going to be talking with some great friends from ... brandy Johnson and also Sean modest\nAnd we're going to take a look at a at some of the some of the programs that they offer at ... welcome nice to have your brandy and Sean thank you thank you will come\nWell thanks for taking the time to to ah to come along you know I'm One of the things that are um I don't know too much about and I've seen Humanae I just really excited about learning more about what he meant it does\nAnd I know that you're both based out of Colorado Springs but you serve a larger area so tell us a little bit of humanity and that how how you function ah in this in this area\nAll right so Humanae is a complete Medicare company we also um [noise] are so Brandi and I are both full service eight years so we cover all products\nSo that's where we come in and we actually live here in public Colorado and we branch out so we were technically work from homes or work I Hope\nThey're okay with the home office to get up in the springs to cover that larger that larger peace\nCorrect yeah so you man has been in business for over fifty years ah they started out in the nursing home business they kind of branched out purchased hospitals kinda got through that side of it and started working into the Medicare realm\nOr that allowed them to start out getting Medicare Advantage Medicare supplements prescription drug plans and then they brought us agents in where we actually do the whole spectrum you know life health annuities everything\nYeah I didn't I didn't know how large this spectrum really was so brainy what ah so ... what kinds of products are you do you handle specifically amount or do you kind of handle everything\nWell we we handle everything actually and we are full service insurance agents with Hannah that's what we call ourselves and on our business cards and you'll see it and it says um service agent or sales agent we're not here just to tell people things were actually here to\nEducate people on health and wellness you man is a health and wellness company a lot of people don't realize that either so we offer a lot of different programs that are not just Medicare and not just dental and vision not just life insurance but we also try to educate our community as well [noise] well\nThat's that's really important part of the show it's really educating our listeners to what's out there but one of the things that that I think when I look at this topic is is that\nWe don't plant enough um if you're a senior in your aging or your son or daughter oftentimes we don't react like we should until there's an issue and then you wonder well I should have known about that or I should have done that earlier\nAnd so is that something that you both run into a lot when you're talking to families about uh any one of these issues is is it really bringing people up to speed and letting them know that now's the time to do this um how does it work for you\nSure um we have we had a lot of confusion especially when we say the N word Medicare yeah of course and a lot of people aren't sure what to do so that's what we're here for in the community to educate and and start planning for if you're sixty\nYou you need to think about when you're turning sixty five you needed to start thinking about those things now what's going to be available for you and what are your options going to be\nYeah you want to make sure if you're a veteran you have if you're a veteran benefits or you want to make sure how that last or I guess you could say the last quarter of your life is going to play out\nUm unfortunately we do run into where we're doing\nA life meeting and nobody's looked at their life insurance plan for Twenty years ago I got one no big deal well who's your beneficiaries poll loophole the plans outlook at him\nUnfortunately make sure they're not to know accidental plans because we run into it all the time was an accidental insurance plan accidental\nYou know I don't I never made it gave me ... years ago and I want to have it\nYeah it's an accidental death so that we're OK yeah sorry they they actually have two accidental death policies where they don't pay out unless you die from an accidental death right where you know they're thinking they had life insurance and as soon as you know mom or dad passed where we're going to be able to help pay for this funeral or what ever happened\nAnd unfortunately it doesn't so we always do a review and we make sure we tell everybody pull it out at least every five years make sure you're beneficiaries are where you are\nMake sure nobody has any cognitive issues where they can't make any decisions anymore we need to change those beneficiaries we'd do all that and then well so do the Medicare review to where we okay do you have your everything's set where you need to get your Medicare\nWow so random when you go in a unit appointment\nUm do you have you have so many umbrellas here we're talking about I mean this is there's a lot of different facets that humanity does do you usually get called in to a meeting on one specific basket or when you called in by a family to sort of do a a big review of their entire situation\nNormally it it well it depends on the situation of course but um a lot of people will call essence they we have no idea what's next we don't know what to do this just happened or that just happened to her hand turning sixty five and two months and I don't know what the heck I'm doing so at\nThat point Medicare appointments or Medicare appointments were not allowed to actually talk about other policies like life insurance during those appointments\nSo that's why we're here is to not just gets you set up on on one type of insurance but we also follow up with you and we become your agent basically to help guide you through the life insurance policies and help guide you through ... dental and vision even\nAnd and and I can and I can sense that there's when you're negotiate this sort of labyrinth\nOf of information that sometimes we get compressed I mean I'm sixty one I'm all of a sudden for the first of all my life thinking you know what not only do I get a Happy Meal certain restaurants but I'm going to be up for a Social Security itself I got to think about that\nAnd then I got to think about this Medicare thing and how does that all tie in to me and it's a little overwhelming and I think\nUm I sort of look at you when you're in your chapter of your sixties maybe you should be looking at in the chapter of your fifties and maybe I'm a little late and so this is another reason this is a good show for me just because I Want to know what's out there would I should be\nAnd ... and it's nice to know that you have boundaries too you know you go in and although hey look here we are you slap Eighteen thousand pamphlets of the day and age we're here to serve you you know and I think it's a good way to go is to is to really kind of take people down he let's review where you are let's take a look at how you're feeling about\nYour process your aging some of us expect a ... short a timeline of life some people are going to be on an escalator for a long long long time and so that really does change things up or is that ... is that how you approach this\nYeah when when we go in you know we may have a Medicare planet so we go in\nWe do a full we do a full review saying okay what what makes you not sleep at night you know are you worried about things are you worried about this and that's where we'll condense down to products and say okay these are the three that will helps sleep\nYeah help you sleep better do most of your business come from friends and family members who refer people because they know that they need some help\nOr do you or or is it when you're out in the community you just you just kind of happened to run into people's this'll referrals sort of thing where people in Pueblo should be telling their friends about a program like this and for sure and having people pursue it\nAbsolutely and it's kind of funny because our friends and family are actually the ones that are the hardest for us to talk [laughter]\nSo they're great at referring people to say hey brandy and Sean can help you out but they don't really listen to us very well our friends and family don't but we also work with the VSW with low income housing units we work with\nAll of the doctors in town and in southern Colorado we are in our doctors' offices and talking to our our physicians and and their staff saying hey this is what we can do and\nThat's kind of how we get our referrals and people come in and say hey I heard you that you didn't just do Medicare you also do life insurance or you also do hospital plans or even short term home health care\nWhat I Want to term care insurance do you guys stay away from that product or do you embrace that\nLong term care is pretty pretty cumbersome and is pretty expensive after a certain age\nOr so there's a lot of avenues to kind of stare around instill implement or in bed the long term care or you can do that with the ... and you can embed like a long term care writer so you're not losing your money is still run you know if you were to go to long term care then it's going to turn\nOkay and and we're going to do that again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it or will be able to to give you more of this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that that you face with families you know you're walking into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming and then we we don't know what's gonna happen\nAll insurances are what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect you and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nThe defense team yeah yeah because you're going to see things coming that we don't see that are still sort of amazed at how complex\nThis whole this whole system is showing how 'bout you what ... what are some of the challenges similar or do you if you walk in and you've dealt with families I'm getting there do you think getting their affairs in order maybe one of the big things people need to think about\nI think his affairs in order huge because we'll all my kids can just throw me outside or my kids can pay for things and you're gone\nNow and I bet you if we made a phone call they'd probably say how much is it what do we need to do so um but yeah I I Would say truthfully we're all used to a corporate world where we have an HR person that says here you need this take this\nWhere we all retired and all of a sudden we're going what do I do where do I go that's where you could say brandy and I are your age are person 'cause we can help direct even ... I I'm a big believer even if he didn't pick him in at least we helped you make a good choice in what you're going to do next right or where to plan and what to do\nYou need a strategy team to guide you so I think this is a great discussion and they were going to ... uh come back and just a few moments in a kind of close out the show and we'll give you the overview to Humanae now you're listening to the senior living today show we'll be right back after these a brief ... said don't go away\nSometimes in our lives we need a little help\nWhether it's you or a loved one consider visiting angels to provide the personal care you deserve visiting angels has been serving southern Colorado since two thousand\nAnd has been selected in the nation wide home care leadership and excellence award for twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen from one to twenty four hours a day visiting angels provide your loved ones with experience caregivers to provide the love and companionship to keep you in the place that you love\nThe best with hygiene transportation meals and like housework\nAnd you'll appreciate the longstanding better\nBusiness Bureau rating of an a plus and so when it's time for you to get a little house called visiting angels at five\nFour three forty two twenty five four three four two two zero or go to visiting angels dot com for more information\nOn Mount laughing services my camera and there are other actors provide bouncing around ... tried to match their prices for quality behind vie for\nProfessional a personalized service important foreign federal guards or laugh lines there really is no match for now ... trained to Montgomery and they were had remained a rare that compound ownership and operation means a lot but it's not for being located\nIn our community the town actor then go to Montgomery Sarah dot com or Portland combine them ...\nAnd now back to the senior living today show with your host David Early on news dot five Ninety Casey as J.\nA. thanks for joining us today on the senior living today show we're coming down the home stretch this is day return on your host and I'm a news talk five Ninety Casey us Jay every Saturday morning at eight thirty\nAnd usually on Sunday is it ten so a loved to have you join us a\nRight here in southern Colorado or around the world on my heart radio dot com just go to ... find Casey as Jay and you can hear us for ever you may be that we're talking with Randy Johnson Ishaan modest from Humanae and we're talking about some of the programs they offer as we\nAs we kind of wrap up the show one of the things we wanted to talk about was veterans and there's a lot of veterans in this area how can you impact them\nSo we always kind of try to meet our first question on both of our laptops are you a veteran\nEver goes why why do you ask well because there's other benefits that may be available to you that you may not know about um plus brandy just did a stand down where we did the homeless veterans gave 'em haircuts clothing\nUm counseling services there was one in there for you know how to buy a house or so um so there's multiple laugh as to what we can help do for veterans I had a veteran call or a veterans son call me asking about you know hey my my father just passed away what do I need to do to get his service taking care of\nColumbia so this is where we need to go there you go and so we we help on that and we have the\nConnection is eight and attendance programs I mean there really are a lot of veterans services available many of us who are veterans didn't even really know about ... until just in the last few years there's been a lot of uh shined a light on that so look if you have a loved one\nThe veteran a you know give these folks that call I think there should be that would be a a great way to go I'm so Randy Johnson is showing motto let's give out your information so that people could get a hold of you and you maybe help guide them a little bit\nCake so Sean modest I cover Pablo Kenyan\nAll the way through ... up and Alamosa that's my pretty much my main territory or footprint are the best phone number to reach me seven one nine to three seven four or five one nine or just to do a consultation see if there's anything else that you may be missing have no no fees no requirements\nAnd ms ...

show the show about seniors for seniors and those of us that loved them I'm Dave ... here at news talk five Ninety Casey us Jay and uh we enjoy doing the show with you I'm here in the studio with Randy Johnson\nAnd also Sean modest from Humanae and it's great to have you both on board and we talk a little bit here about short term healthcare insurance but before we do I want to thank our sponsors of the show\nVisiting angels a problem for us sponsoring the show as well as Montgomery in Stuart funeral directors great companies\nAnd a few need those services we'd sure encourage you to to use them\nAnd when we're talking about the short term home health care insurance is up you know that's a subject that we don't really uh we\nDon't know when it's when we're going to need it it sort of catches you off guard but I think it's really a great discussion uh to to to have in terms of what's available out there and what should we be thinking about and maybe many of us are unaware that this even exists so give us a little over a view on what this is\nWell most Americans like to recuperate in their own home or from hospital stay or in a nursing facility stay and so Humanae\nHas actually partnered up with ... which is guaranteed trust it's a great company has been around for ... years and we are offering this new short term home healthcare insurance to cover you while you're at home to cover\nA home health care home health care aide even with benefits for prescription costs as well as hospitals say I'm coverage\nSo ... so it's so it's a wide wide birth of a lot of items that are put into a policy like this um it's probably ... is this something new or that that you're that you're offering has this been out there for a long time\nNo this is actually new within the last couple of months that's new to new within our portfolio I guess you want to say ah there's probably a few other companies out there but knew the Humanae we've been doing this for a month you know after training and going over but over a month and people are actually liking that\nYou know hey I get paid back for prescriptions that I'm taking\nA which most of us take at least one or so\nAnd then it's also going to cover it depends on what you look at and how much you want and you kinda can build your own kind of like a big you know happy ... my way like the I Want this or that so you can put in the hospital stay it comes with the basic short term healthcare but you can add pieces to it to help cover your gaps in your insurance coverage\nOkay good so it's very customized double it sounds like and that's kind of what is that where a lot of products are going in the future to to give people better choices and and there seem it seems to be complicated so this kind of fills those holes right\nRight it does it does cover the gaps in care\nBut it also like Shawn said a lot of us are taking medication this policy is actually for any one forty years old and older not just the sixty five Medicare people so uh this this covers some co pays for you and and a lot of us that take medication every day we're all paying a co pay almost every month\nIn the big picture um are the changes from Obamacare a ... there's a lot of high level stuff\nOut there and maybe we don't even want to go down that road because I think none of us really know and maybe you don't either all where this is all going and so you know a lot of times you're just trying to to to to provide products that really meet the needs of the of the clients white here in southern Colorado\nThat that that need so yeah we'll avoid that subject but I think you know where where it's all going I'm sure you we all scratch our heads and and maybe you know he met his no different you try to you know to continue on this track 'em in the time that we have\nI Do want to talk about some of the supplements and Medicare and I must admit I'm One of those that I don't know a lot about it\nBut the the Medicare ... supplements I think are valuable could you can you what have you explain that to where we position is\nIn our families and our futures [laughter]\nSo that's where we as agents branding I go in and we make sure that the first thing is what you know like I said before what keeps you up at night while I'm worried about hospitals I'm worried about these so we'll do that needs analysis so supplemental are what they are\nYour Medicare is going to pay first or even your individual and then you're supplemental insurance is going to come in and pay what's leftover or depend on the plan what small co pays you may have or out of pocket you may have\nUm [noise] you'd does range from there's got from a through and\nSo those are quite a few out there that you can kind of look at it and very they're very him priced too so\nYou may be paying your Medicare premium plus you have to pay that supplemental premium and that's where a lot of families may not be able to afford that bigger premium so then at that point that's where we go okay well let's look at this other option which may be Medicare Advantage\nAnd I think brand you can cover Medicare Advantage a little bit more on that side\nYeah in ... with the supplements to you also have to have a prescription drug plan a lot of people\nOn that we run into they were like why do we even I don't take medication I don't want him a prescription drug plan\nA lot of people don't realize that Medicare penalize if you if you did not get a prescription drug plan when your Medicare start and that penalty goes for life so it's kind of scary to think about but that's where the Medicare Advantage comes in and we kind of put everything altogether\nAh we kind of think about it as a child doesn't really well it's a combination played at the Mexican restaurant where we we put it all together we put your medical your prescription and everything else all in one plan and it really covers everything under one umbrella\nSo when the chips are down we need to solve so we need to we need to solve you know and this is I think this discussion is really good because I Know so little about it and I've said so many times this is a team sport\nYou know this aging thing is a team sport there's so many things that we don't know the island theory is the more you think you know the more you find out you don't know so you really need a a team of professionals around you\nUm we're talking with you man a brand new Johnson and Sean modest and uh and uh what I'd like to do is just quickly just cover if you if they've got questions on this subject and they would like to\nDo to have some more information is there an office number that they can call you at\nI'm actually on our office as we stayed at the beginning of the show is in Colorado Springs the best way to get a hold of Sean and I are on our cell phone okay and my cell phone number is seven one nine to three eight six three five five and Sean's is seven one nine to three seven four or five one night\nOkay and and we're going to do that again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it or will be able to to give you more of this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that that you face with families you know you're walking into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming I mean we we don't know what's gonna happen\nAll insurance is or what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect you and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nMilitary my family as part of what are my family for a long time I want to go on to make a difference I didn't find that working behind a desk so for me and then they offered in my community for my country was just like them\nTo learn how to be part

as the sunshine vitamin but folks here's the problem\nMany of us aren't getting enough sunshine lately between flattering on those powerful sunscreens in spending more time indoors and what it really comes down to is this vitamin D deficiency that's out there is causing an avalanche of health problems for Seventy percent of our population ranging from\nPain loss of balance muscle weakness depression increase blood pressure arthritis memory loss and even a compromised immune system and I have Dr Michael Pincus with me today to talk about the most effective way to get vitamin D Dr ... it's good to talk to you again\nIt's great to be back thank you\nYou know many of you know that Dr ... is a nationally recognized authority unnatural an alternative health he's a successful chiropractor he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and he continues to be very involved in some today's top health concerns and\nLet's start at the top Dr ... talk a little bit about what are some of the warning signs that you may be deficient in vitamin D\nOkay well tired of it is how you feel and one of the things Chris is being tired for no apparent reason okay but on the river side of that I've seen that of lack of vitamin D affects your sleep\nOkay another fix China's at your bones ache now there's a lot of people listening who have been diagnosed with ... which is a thinning of the ... ... but again a vitamin D deficiency a big one is muscle weakness do you try to get up from a couch you get in and out of a car and you're finding it more and more difficult and that's\nLeading to the high high prevalence of people fall in and injuring themselves\nOh okay All right you know it's just a huge problem right exactly\nI Know that when you tend to get more calls especially upper respiratory problems okay problems with\nBlood pressure cardiovascular problems that justice problems consultation bloating gas ... it's very very common
