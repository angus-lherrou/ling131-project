[laughter] yeah it's not going to they're no they're not a powerhouse by any means you're dealing with a\nA really low horsepower engine that things have changed so much now I mean we're talking about even some of the really weak vehicles or you know for a hundred horse\nPower in in some of these bigger things now where we were lucky to get a hundred and fifty to yes hundred and Seventy five out of some of these old big engines you know they just did that\nI've driven a lot of older Chevy Truck and they just had a lot more you know horse power get up and go to this thing does\nWell and part of that could be because it's old and warn it's just you know I I Know I\nGot really of value on well wow\nYeah and then it'll be old and warn of I've seen have you on a fire truck that Scott thirty thousand miles on it yet either\nThey're shot a you know a lot of that has to do with idle time a lot of it has to do with just the components that they made these things out of and their ability to the not wear out in the fluids that were available at the time\nA new like you see all all the time no cars now we say oh two hundred thousand miles it's runs great so good good car well the same car made with thirty or forty thousand miles that was Thirty years old the\nThe things you're going to want to do those still just like any other gasoline combustion engine is\nIf it's if you if you just acquired it you know make sure do a cylinder test to see what kind of healthy you have a just a simple compression early down tested each cylinder easy to get at the spark plugs for the most part and you can check just to make sure you got healthy cylinders\nAnd at that point they should timing is that correct or make sure that the U.S distributor and is in good shape\nYou know just some of the the carburetor uh you can't always do much with those if they're operating correctly find out if it's open to all the the uh you know all the correct to butterflies and everything it it just makes it chokes not stuck\nOr just stuff like that that can make them extra doggy but they they weren't awesome to begin with\nKnowing a lot of those the timing is off but they they had so little contribution per se owned her to make up all eight that um\nSometimes if you disable one cylinder you really didn't hear a huge difference in the engine but if you've got that one ... it's going to be noticeable while you're trying to drive it but it may still run pretty good at idol\nIs it a straight stick yes so does it seem like it ... if you're in your polling gears of the better ratio does it is it the same way if you're like in first gear second gear\nIt it's got a little more slapped them and then you get up to the higher a speed but\nThat's you know what I got to talk about the scout again because I just can't stop myself wanting the scout in a in a local small town drawing for the American legion as a fundraiser and it was somebody had donated it was just to use a\nLittle bit rusty scout and I'm like oh this is kinda cool what year was it I Want to see it was the Seventy four or five\nI'm going to look it up and we'd like orange knows white it was hard to top it was it was I Believe will not had a thrill for ... or something like that and they yeah and it was definitely an eight and for whatever reason into will drive that thing could spin the tires\nMy ... one of my best friends in my cousin tied he snapped the drive shafted it finally we we got a little too aggressive with it but that made a a number of runs up the split rock river\nWhen it was frozen in the wintertime [laughter] up into the trees I could talk about it now but [laughter] it was up I was the wrong person to wait a minute about my life [laughter]\nIt was free right pill [laughter] I bought a raffle ticket right or what it was you know their bottom of the split road I Know we we\nWe sold it to somebody who was still serviceable well thanks for calling we appreciate it Don\nDon thanks very much for the call good luck let's talk to Nathan Nathan you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\nKnow why I I got a two thousand five Subaru Legacy\nAnd and we've got problems with the rear suspension the at the back of the car said almost looks like it's been lowered and we can't seem to figure it out on what needs to be replaced or what's going on um\nAll the the whole batch shocks springs all that had been replaced and the funny thing I think it's gotten a little worse\nSome kind of looking for ideas I mean I've even found on line where a couple of different places are shows actually selling psyche butts basis for ... so I don't know if this was a common problem if that's the solution or not\nWe're all those springs instructs replaced with brand new parts\nYes yeah and it rears I actually replace the whole gist I ordered the whole um shock and spring altogether I didn't want to mess with a person and the springs down\nAnd when you and I didn't even I you know it was it good as soon as you did that for a short period or is it still exactly the same\nI remember it being a little better but it never really fixed the issue\nIs it the same problem with the the grand prix using that Ninety seven to old\nLever a full ready strode on there with everything on it correct\nYep exactly yup just held it right on some of them were just lower like with the grand prix and that or they just they set\nA little lower when they were brand new they were good for ten thousand miles than they settled and that's where they stayed and they were lower and if you don't like the way they did they do have some time space available when you put those spaces in it sometimes you need a layman sometimes you don't depending on\nWhat is a modified in that suspension on a car but they they do ride the all the ones I can picture in my head right now that our customers have most of them ride pretty low but\nI just I just pulled it up on Google Images all the images looked like the Atkins rides ... like they all look like they're saying look at it to a little bit yeah\nI guess I'm not I'm trying to understand if he's described as something where he is or if he had some of those ah you know those things people hang on the bumper if they'd be dragging underground or if you know how low it is in your nicknamed the Kurdish part well there but the\nHitch on that there's a hitch on there and it drags out it drags you know\nEasy if you had had skipped that's now all the way that he just [laughter]\nYeah there isn't a bunch of weight and back or anything but it just looks like it's sitting lower than it should like something's wrong with the ... suspension\nWell just trying to think of the way the cars you know the ballast in the car if there's anything that could be on the front the ... just trying to think through the ... geometry of the car if there's anything we're missing here or anti sway bars are are going to stop typically left and right when you're keeping the car flat when you're going to a quarter that really shouldn't have anything to do with it\nUm you know as far as the suspension into back though some of the cars not this one they'd have like a ... a transfer Springer cross there that would sometimes ... people would like in the grand breezy early ones that was a common problem but\nNot in this kind of a car it's it's kind of an independent suspension with that stretch there's only so many single that there is there's only so many things back there I Would say that if you're any\nIs there any downside to putting those Pacers enemies or anything that's going to\nKnow why it or it could harm something\nYou want to get it aligned you you want a good qualities but he's with the break on you and then you want to get it aligns when you change the height of a car the right eye you're going to change the climate so it's got to be it's got to be aligned after that's been adjusted\nThe even the ... like Chevy Trucks a lot of people but they they said crooked so in the dodge do they want to ... have leveling kits available for them to to bring you end up you want to make sure those things wind good\nYeah we did that to my sons pick up we put the level or get on the front spring blocks to the back just to bring the right height up a little bit and we brought it down headed range headed so aligned after that just to give me back into true and that was the recommended operating procedure\nNathan thanks very much for the call good luck that'll do it for another hour of the under the hood show until next time you can

would it exists so a new start up as developed a way to get lazy people to work up a sweat by driving\nI'm intrigued the fit ... ... it's a pedal powered vehicle that's what the ... is based on an Audi a four von ... powered by the regular two point oh leader four cylinder gas engine but control of its acceleration and breaking\nIs due to bicycle pedals\nThe PC and be like a horrible idea trouble idea the ... remove the accelerator pedal and in its place as a pair of bicycle pedals hooked up to uh fly will the accelerators control and that actually exist they've gotten there done that they've done it the accelerator is controlled by an active peddling motion rather than depressing the peddling a conventional vehicle\nThey must have modified the foot ... well too right they had to deal with this set of generates an electronic pulse to engage accelerator they've also remove the break and replace it with a hand brake located on the steering column\nConcept allows you know you can imagine what there's three modes drive fast for highway speed so it's like a tense Pete Dr slow for slow moving traffic and no drive for bumper to bumper traffic drivers can also opt in for a harder

here's a call that came into the hotline\nHello my name is ... we have a two thousand seven Nissan just about eighty seven thousand miles on the road for so under a lot of the stunts like squeaking perhaps onto the good took it and get it checked does it really need the ... changed you can only has a dissidents\nOf miles on it we should be holding off on that in order to just minor it's not it's a very hard to hear what it's like he he\nWrote a great question money to take a swing at this one sure I can have your feelings Pepe a yeah change it\nThat it it eighty seven thousand miles is I Would say a hundred ... this this I'm winging this I'm making a hundred thousand it's probably about the the uh interval on that and said that squeaking it's telling you maybe there's an issue I Would go ahead and changing ... nothing bad will happen I'm worried about\nThe eleven years yeah there you go it's the time and the elements of eleven years is a it's a long time most recommendations are going to be half of that to replace the main excess rebuilt and a lot of these vehicles\nNow having said that I've had numerous ones that I've taken past the five to say I really wouldn't do that but but if you're started if it's starting to talk to you and they believe it's coming from the belt\nYou want to look at the belt and there are some of the ... and things like that that they make\nIf you look into it in the parts catalog and they have a common sold part it's a ... for that vehicle that can sometimes be an indication that get the kitten replace all the push replaced the rollers and everything like that but if it's just a tiny ...\nWould start with the low hanging fruit put the belt on it while the belt is off have 'em just inspect all the I ... and different things to make sure nothing is exceptionally loose and you should be just fine so I'm more concerned about the fact that it's got eleven years on it almost twelve than I Am about eighty seven thousand miles\nIf he called and said the exact same thing it was this vehicle and it had it worked fine ran find he wants to buy it and it has never had the serpentine built change you would say\n... change about you know I I've definitely changed belt and so that things that people forget\nQuite a bit is that it's not always the miles at the time in in the time that something's been in service has to do with the elements if if yes that had been in a climate controlled storage and never been out in the elements you get\nAdvantage of making that stuff last longer but the the rubbers and the and the tires or the belts the

otherwise and so there are great opportunities out there at least Augustus and who's a coach for algebra newer source is with us and we're going to talk about if you're a senior there are some great opportunities to continue to understand who you are\nWhat you are and make sure that you could be out and do something exciting good morning Lisa great to have you on the show\nGood morning David I'm

that are that need to listen to the store so\nWe'll do it let's let's find out a little bit more about what you do and then we'll talk about how our listeners could relate to what it is you specialize in\nAbsolutely I'm an alternative career coach I'm with the entrepreneurs source there from that's thirty four years old\nWith coaches located across North America and I have an office here in southern Colorado in Pueblo and I work with people locally including in Colorado Springs Pueblo and\nI'm canyon city and so forth but I also work with people a nationally and I get to have the opportunity of actually working with people on their dreams looking at possibilities option and dreams\nCreating a life that they've always wanted and looking for self sufficiency and financial freedom you know Seventy five percent of the adult population Dave desires to be self sufficient um however\nMany of us don't know where to start including me up until several years ago I always wanted to be self sufficient independent but I didn't know where to go so I get to work with people who want to go on a journey of discovery\nSo you never too old to become an entrepreneur\nI was I was in my early fifties and actually it looked like\nThe worst thing in the world it happened to me I'd been with a fortune five hundred company actually they were in the top twenty uh and had been with him for twelve years very successful had a multi state team\nAnd uh the company decided to go in a new direction and so my position across the enterprise was eliminated and so here I was with this company that's a hundred and sixty years old thinking I'm safe you\nKnow nothing's going to happen here I'm going to have my benefits I'm if I wanted to retire here I could\nUh I'm going to keep stacking up that four one K. and then lo and behold\nThey eliminated all of the people in my position and got rid of the position and distributed our responsibilities to I'm younger less tenured people and so I sat there and thought well my gosh this could happen\nAt this point in time right is it safe to go back into these corporations that you feel like I'm you're going to stay with forever and earn that golden parachute so to speak\nAnd so this was great for you a new career and coaching people helping them find of the special qualities the experiences that they have to enable them to you know sort of walk with them while they're broadening their capacity and broadening their perspective\nYeah usually when these things happen\nThen it's a window of reflection at the time when

Colorado Army National guard here by the Colorado broadcasters association at\nThis station hello and welcome to another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress\nOr even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you that may not know Dr ... he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns of Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose\nAs the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in there in the upper back in ... right and the doctor I'm more concerned\nAbout the muscles that you don't feel that has the muscles in the arteries oh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to research that I've been involved but it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen health and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and\nHow many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering from pain and active roses and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has\nTo do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many ... ... it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYes okay yeah and it does build your teeth\nBut he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\nNobody will ... will up absorb it back from the bones if neither that's right I think\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of about\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of frozen nitrogen\nYup okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but\nFirst of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastor of the nation who they're irradiated um the calcium as much from the soils and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that in absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and a calcium supplements you know they buy at the health food\nStarted writer right but these things don't absorbing the body that's happening\nFor a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say at antacid that had the calcium in it like a ... first of all calcium does that absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment\nBut see what happens when you take a tub with an antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comics formula it natural\nAnd the differences that isn't\nA powder and what happens if you put in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system wow so that's ... well\nYeah because when calcium and museum or a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than any other state well\nThat's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says the fans to absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one way to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications sleeping pills that the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula or incredibly\nInto by the thing is is that when you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people right at the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after the ... the pain in my wrist one way or I was able to sleep for the first time in years I mean this is really amazing\nI Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium in try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number you can call\nIt's one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium the gets absorbed into your

and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that every day stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and\nHow we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nI I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nBoy we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs

thank you bet by by very very good in a artists welcome\n[laughter] hello yes Hi thanks for taking my call you bet and ... Khan about is I think I Want to help my daughter with a dry wall\nHere in the bathroom and it we're quite a paper holder is attached to the wall there are two ... one of the impact the other one\nIs clearly a wall and there's dry wall hole there and it's probably about an inch and a half a wider point your parents height and maybe\nWe should warn but I don't know I even took a class\nAt a handy how on and on about Dr wallich here that I'm Wondering how they can work with Hank ... hats that racket there there's nothing behind the drywall I mean it's just open space\nAnd how big is so we have two holes that are that the brackets said hold the wallpaper or the toilet paper a holder on the wall or maybe\nLike a ... inch and a half long and maybe an inch high was is that a closed in their eyes ... hardly\nPay an inch and a half or so tall and not very wide ... about an inch wide of right\nAnd then there's two screws that go through that into the uh drywall\nI Believe so I looked at closely at the bracket but I'm Wondering if if the three haired and I don't know just here [noise] um [noise] it's something needs to be done other than just the packing material put on there and you're probably going to any\nMore than that you're probably going to need a little bit more than that let me ask you a question the whole where that bracket that whole bracket the one bracket is no longer attached to the dry wall so there's a whole they're\nCorrect right and how big is that whole\nWell it's probably not more than an inch an inch and a half at the higher and higher wise about\nIt's very good it's not all the same height and that is about three inches wide or sell\nOkay so that's going to be a challenge to patch it and then to come back in a put a bracket on it so that's what I was afraid I yeah so there's a couple of things we could do I'm One\nOf those things you might do is get an expression plate and the ... plate is something that may be ... just imagine a block\nOf wood that would cover that both of those brackets okay\nAnd they sell those decorative once okay oh\nAnd we would take that other bracket out right and we would basically install this ... this backer\nPiece okay so that would be there that would be visible that would go on and on the surface it would be decorative you can go up to the hardware store and you'll see 'em they Darren Woods\nSome memories sustain you could paint 'em and it's just a an ornate a backers backer piece\nThat goes over both holes that would get screwed and then you could screws a tour of the brackets on to that piece of wood in reinstalled your toilet holder\nYour toilet paper home okay I'd take a look at that\nThere's also plates that you can you know install over the whole uh but that's going to be a little bit challenging to than mount something on there I really take a look at some of your options on an excursion\nBehind a toilet paper over there and walk through the ... by all the different folders I think you'll find something that'll work nicely for you [noise]\nAll right thank you much in the music's playing were already out of\nOut of the time and those are quick weekend again don't

terms of overall health\nNow document as I got to ask the question I mean you know you you you've got to talk to a little bit about some of the things that we can be experiencing without having enough item and see but you know the reality is\nThat I'm sure I'm not getting enough item and see based on what you said I I I'm not arguing that point but the reality is I I'm Still standing I I still wake up every morning what's the big deal here I mean hasn't the government figured out that there is some level of vitamin C. that you need to have in order to be healthy\nWhen you're talking about the government and nutrition and health recommendations\nBoy they get like a D. minus because they're already a for vitamin C is sixty milligrams sixty military ... inadequate the RDA for vitamin C. was determined so you don't die from ... but sixty milligrams of vitamin C. is like partially water and your grass so it's not quite brown\nYou see what I mean and that's the problem with our bodies is that we're not getting the vitamin C. we need and you need vitamin C. the writer mouse and the right form in order to get yourself into a high level health but why why is that so critical do why is getting enough vitamin C. so critical\nWhile just recap number one your body doesn't make it\nToo is that if you're not getting the right amount of it which is at least three thousand four thousand five thousand milligrams per day vitamin C. you're going to be someone who is on multiple medications you run into doctors you're got blood pressure problems\nYou don't make the good cholesterol

that's the way they like it now let's go under the hood with a nordstroms motor medics welcome back to the end of the show we're glad to have you with us eight six six five nine for for one\nFive oh if you are where a police officer and you came upon a car that was wrapped around a tree you'd be very nervous yes this story does have a good ending okay but uh in may recently\nThe police in Nevada phone eight totaled out McLaren seven twenty s near lake meat\nAnd that would make me nervous did I Would a room it was going to a hundred miles is the seven\nHundred and ten horse power twin turbo charged V. eight car that weighs less than thirty two hundred pounds so we're talking about a a car they can get some sort of sixty in less than three ... quick very quick\nWell they ran across this car and they looked up the car and they say the car was purchased just before the friday before it's a a dealership in washing your were Washington DC\nOh and they found it the next day in the great falls area\nSo there are kind of concerned\nAnd so the police department they go out and they put out a message on Twitter saying buying a high performance car which costs about three hundred thousand dollars was total and winding road by on friday total on Saturday the moral of the story that was was printed here or in the final assembly and a lot of automotive news was that\nEven a a hyper super car that has the best suspension and the best breaks and the best of everything for driving fast\nThrough a winding road with a properly trained driver right that respects the car\nCan lead to ... near deadly circumstances and if I should do this picture the driver was minor league injured oh my but that's what they ran across I Can't show our listeners that pitcher but I can show Russian Christ that picture out ... you would you would expect to come upon that vehicle and find\nRight someone not with us any All right and I know from experience that if you get a car that you think you'd understand and do something you aren't trained to do it can go bad in a hurry I've had that happened in my life for a couple of different time usually cars\nThat stick really hard and performed really well around those corner when they break loose when they break loose hang on much worse than regular\nCars sold on this is just a good reminder slow down it could cost the especially if you're driving your new McLaren ... seven twenty s not a good not a good thing not a good thing at all\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's a call that came in after hours\nGuys out here in the back door got a two thousand viewing this or the or does it work\nFor the warm air into the ... not ... the cross troubles warm there\nOnce the engine gets up to operating conditioned about a hundred and eighty three hundred and eighty five degrees no matter where he just said it starts cooling any ideas on that is\nSo it's fine warming up so it has heat when until warms up yeah\nThe bad thing about that is a lot of cars that have head gasket issues that start blowing exhaust gases into the cooling system when that ... gets fully warmed up and in ...\nThe thing the cooling flow\nTo act like that as they start up and they're starting to warm up oh great cold air warm air warmer hot air now the temp uses up now it's colder and it'll switch back and forth as you drive down the road and accelerate the celery\nThat's one of the that's a possibility the only other thing you could be is the complete failure of one of the fresh air vents are where it would be ducking right past the heater core fresh outside their\nRight or electronic temp sensor in the car that once it warms up says ... and it changes I mean those are a couple of things\nWe would be leaning towards doing a head gasket check on a vehicle like that to see if it with a with a gas tester now do you do that well you know it's a pretty simple ... are kept comes off when you but there's no pressure do don't blow it off this has something to shop needs to do\nWhat they would remove the cap they would use the or the or a full bottle whatever your applause draws gases from the radiator just a or know who went through this two filled with liquid a couple of separate compartments and as it goes through\nIf there's hydrocarbons which was anything that's in your\nTailpipe coming out in that cool which there should be none of it indicates there's a crack in a block or head or a head gasket leak immediately turns colors from usually from blue to yellow and you you\nGot a problem but if that doesn't occur there is a good indication that it's something else but that's a quick cheap test to find out what's going on\nOur head gasket better these days or has my life changed as I've become an adult\n[noise] yeah and well here's part of it though they've started going to similar mated metals between the head the block okay a lot of her head gasket problems came in when we had aluminum cylinders had sitting on top of a cast iron block\nAnd so you had different properties of cheating different properties of the of of the ability to to flex under heat and marrying the too doesn't always work great\nSo when I was in high school a ten year old car was a Nineteen eighty car so they were more likely to be\nWell and and even before that you had cast iron on top of caster ... which wasn't as much of a problem but when they started getting in the middle ground there to live with them on top of castor that's what we started seeing more oh yeah more more problems with head gasket in into the gas gets now as we've advanced\nWe have got aluminum blocks aluminum heads and also you are in some situations not pushing 'em the pressure or through the system that you were on the other ones but I I think the bigger issue would probably be the fact that the coolest properties have gotten better\nUh I think people are more\nIn tune with cooler maintenance than they probably were ten years ago\nI think the court maintenance used to be looked upon in a similar fashion as break\nFluids maintenance maintenance is today replace it when there's a leap exactly yeah and they didn't realize the ability for that cool it to build up ... properties and metallic properties just based on its use through the vehicle\nAnd and those are the things over time if it's not replaced in that\nThe coolest gets whether it be too acidic or to have you in one property other\nIt'll start chip away at the gas gets and eventually cause the puzzle leak and so I think that the combination of some of those things have changed that so we don't see those those normal offenders like we usually would still see a lot of it out there\nThanks for joining us on the under the hood show until next time you can
