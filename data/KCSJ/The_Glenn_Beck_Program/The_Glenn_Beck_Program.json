them this is the story of the Jewish people just survive\n\nThat's why the nation of Israel exist if people don't understand that is why no one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so\nThe world just cited let them have this scrap of land they say was there as because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as for told\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and Stalin could concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud of who they were they could finally live\n\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society is the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews\nAnd a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews\nBut people of all faiths all faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\n\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\n\nIs the answer couldn't be more perfect\n\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish\n\nWe help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization\nThat I'm mad man went into Philadelphia\nTo try to stop\nThis is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue story never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the

true\nYou know that would be easiest thing in the world right now sure sure it is sure it is\nThis uh this weekend a I had to really I really had a difficult time uh I mean I just\nDid you guys watch the news all this we can't know as little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting 'cause it's like I get the updates but yeah\nYeah so only to get the updates and stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore\nYeah I I never watch cable news never my the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews can't or oh the N n my heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN jet why don't you\nDon't have those I don't know who's doing that and they do I really don't know who's your\nFans watch Fox you know 'cause it's a safe haven mostly unless you're watches Shepard Smith\nUh [laughter] but that's always been that way but I don't know I'm just\nCNN I don't know who does cause that's it's on watch\nAll the people who hate Trump right yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on it for the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly I if I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to them talk about early do now synagogue thing is he's\nOh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's ... Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of very slowly but surely but he's like you know did he he didn't go there have you dealt with today is the first question was ah you know but what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I Lived in a country\nAs a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning sender in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well\nWhat what what part of of that you think is is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter a outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah we did not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't find them to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment but it has nothing to do with this and all\nThese cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nThat really is really that's what they we never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever the guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot\nAll of the geo ... and another guy and tried to try these trained to kill thirty Republican seat that's tenth of the Republican paint on was working\nFor Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not they didn't even talk about\nIt because they they had a very balanced view of that one for a understood that individuals were responsible for their own actions that time was re understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them and and they always complain about discourse isn't that a great example is terrible discourse yes\nWe can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the pipe bomb think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt 'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individual shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not use ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why Rob Pat Pat in this morning is because uh you know he sees doing more on trivia and\nUh and for a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nYeah it's it you know it's a chance to get away from the discourse for a little wire like an hour a week as and just be maintained yeah interest me mean to\nNo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know that when I'm never going to end on that one\nAnd in fact repeat it ah it consistently gets repeated a it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nWell thank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's Sunday you\nKnow we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really 'cause I have a free tickets but seriously oh now all of a sudden you're in maybe it can change that I can you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ...\nThat would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you or what it is it's Sunday\nA Cleveland I think it Sunday yes it's going back to ... tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ... it's going to be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff\nYou were given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the ... turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nIs that it does\nAnd a Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and and comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of the proceeds from\nThe I'm from the event and um we're giving them to I'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to\nOr to the uh the refugee um oh yeah a group I'm not sure we are going to give 'em to yet but we're we're uh we're\nWe're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um to a a local Jewish um center perhaps the\nThe synagogue and I'm not sure they're not stance from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I notice you went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros stream into\nA and I remember [laughter] and you came back after this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know\nAnd then she posted here's an example of supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros uh as as an example of how much you hate the Jews\nNow I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel award [laughter] that was I thought that's really national award what are the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people crying but beyond that uh it was just it was just presented\nBy the the prime minister of Israel though\nOh well that's it [laughter] it's all okay that's not a big one that out of bed quite a big one so\nIt's just amazing you know 'cause this is not just the criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a ... a conservative and I ...\nThe people in this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them would criticize drug stores but they criticize him because he's a liberal has progressive policies he supports a policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him if I wanted him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history or around the world\nThat but anti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew the same way they don't\nLike been Shapiro because in front of a hero party the policies you know like I don't understand the racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx\nHe was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew now but because he came up with the idea of communism I I'm not a fan no not a fan\nOf fat and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized venture Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said\nThey will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal\nAnd they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know they cannot do it and I it's not all under state it they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite\nWe you're telling me the way the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who was one of the biggest finance here's the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\n... it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas this legal opinion because they don't support what they believe\nIt's not about it it is trying to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a\nA ... ... again this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're killing everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they say\nIt anyway because they don't care [noise]\nThat that that is exactly what they think they claimed to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there too [noise]\nYeah I felt a battering I don't know what I have a good point and ah we're we're going to talk about one when we come back\nCheck out the lens blog five Ninety Days yes J. dot com and keyword

place\nAre we sincerely which are week we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice isn't it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both we're both\nWe've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell was paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America\nAnd not just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\n\nWhy is the constitution were fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on I I'm I we\nCannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line like climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth okay that's a value\nThat's not climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the\nIce age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion and ... and in the scientific field\nYou give me clean cut studies okay\n\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it see they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work\nNow that is a political discussion that is a political discussion you\nKnow where our values come in on that particular discussion when someone says the sciences settled is shut up that flew violation of our values\nWhen people sit down at the table and say look I care about the environment I really do I disagree with the science and here the people on my side that are showing you that this is ... this this collusion\nEnd that yours yours system that you're you're you're you're you're touting is nothing more than a political system\nAnd it doesn't work\nThat's a political discussion those are the things we should have what brings us together at the end\nOr the values\nWe both care about your who doesn't care about the earth sincerely who doesn't care about the earth and I'm tired of being lectured by people who will go and protest and leave us see of garbage buying them for others to keep and clean up\nI'm sick of it don't tell me you care about the environment and then after a protest everything is not about litter\nYou either care about it or you don't words don't mean anything anymore only actions do don't tell me what you believe show me what you believe\nMad country or a good country that's that's the question we have that [noise] is the western\nWay of life we're saving is it good is it nothing about a bunch of ... gender males white males white Europeans that of oppressed people\nIs that is that all is that all it is\nCan I ask you do when you think World War two officially started when did it really start start so not our involvement of yeah not our involvement uh gosh I mean the date I'm not going to get ready or just give me an event [noise]\nTough one uh\nWould you say Germany invades Poland or you know breaks the it's rainy with you know I mean I'm sure you do to a judge Chamberlain or ... ... so you're talking events that lead to weather events I mean you could go on for a million different places and that\nAnd I'll give you I'll give you one how about when Japan invaded China happened in thirty seven if you live on that side of the earth yeah you'll think World War two started then Japan invaded China\nManchuria and they said the only problem was Manchuria is all the ... Mm that sounds familiar\nOr and so they invaded and they started a mass slaughter mass slaughter\nAll of the you know the bad bombings of civilians that happened ... years before we were doing it or the Germans were doing it and how it started in thirty seven in China with the Japanese where was the white man\nNo you know where the white man was you know how history reflects that's now America didn't say anything at the time America didn't step up to the plate and stop the slaughter in China\nSo wait a minute hold it just a second so are we supposed to get involved in everything or are we not supposed to be involved and everything when we get involved you blame us for getting involved in saying we're trying to jam our stuff down everybody's\nThroat when we don't show up you blame us for not showing up either way according to you we violated quilt our values\n\nWhat our values\nOur values used to be we our enemy of no one friend all now that gets a little dicey\nGets really dicey didn't get dicey apparently when the Japanese invaded China\nYeah that's because they only care about Europe no actually no we couldn't fight on all of the friends\nHad to choose we didn't even want to go save Europe America didn't even want to go into war well how could you\nOh my gosh how could you that Europe [noise] wait a minute\nWe're supposed to go to save the white patriarchy where ... wait a minute we are to blame for all of that because we didn't go in and save the white hierarchy I thought you just said that was bad should be destroyed um\nIs America bad or good let's have that

broadcast but then we don't make a tangible\nAnd even you were saying that you haven't been doing it shows you haven't been out of the road for a while I think it's going to be so good for you because you need to connect with the people yes I agree\nMy friend and I generally of I had a a friend of mine that's a Vietnam veteran in his seventies and we went all the way we live in Ashland, Kentucky we got up at\nTwo AM drove six hours to Illinois for it that the Trump rally this weekend on Saturday and\nAnd then stood for eleven hours straight because we were told the first two thousand people in line would get into the hangar and we knew we were going to get that way and and as it got through security and looking at George saying oh I Can't wait to sit down and you get to the hangar there were no states so there's a reality of we're going to be standing another six hours on concrete\nSo when I was saying is this president is a lawyer I'm Sorry I just play that just playing the Brazilian go ahead tell us or\nI could say it as much as they want you know what we were standing in line making fun of the Carbondale a solidarity network which was a socialist group that was coming to protest they had to have their eleven AM pancake breakfast before they came to protest and you know we ... we were joking well do you think there were a vegan and gluten free options to go along with that and\nRight but there were over ten thousand people there for the rally unless they Seventy five people showed up to protest\nThere was not a piece of heard you say this about your ... function is when you've had the restoring functions\nThere was no garbage we he would never know when I was ten thousand people there no one was complaining I was kind of had to warm up to Trump myself and I wasn't tend to get to go to one of these things because I was afraid if I said one negative thing I was going to be completely shouted down\nNo people were so open about talking and\nYou know someone had to go to the bathroom and in their their child stayed with us I mean you're in a group of ten thousand people you trust strangers to watch your child while while you may run and do an errand a comeback real quick it was it was such a positive environment\nYou know it's like a president this happened to show up [laughter] it was\nI and I'm so glad he's actually going to be in Huntington on friday which has five miles away from where I live I'm so glad I went to Illinois because I remember standing in line and seeing the the headline break about the shooting mhm and wait we also went through the doubt of whether the president was going to show up or not\nAnd this is after we got in the hangar it we'd been standing there for two hours but we never gave up hope and we were we we all know we we had jokes of you know conservatives the one thing liberals can do better than us is chance we can't can't it's like when you classes or something\nI Know we saw it and I'm really glad we got [laughter]\nBut you know it's it was such a positive environment and our legs were or just\nKilling us by the time that he got there\nAnd George not drove back that night it was at twenty eight our road trip that we took for the experience\nAnd as exhausted as we were in as much as we were a gang George looks at me and says he's doing one in Missouri later this week as and they how far is that well that was that what it was just six hours Missouri was going to be eight but we were going to go until we found out that this one was going to happen right across the river on friday\nSo fight like angel ... that's the best I can say is go and meet these other people\nTend to Seventy five\n... ... were very quiet people but when you do cut to this rally and there there was just an energy that was there that you realized we can be there's hope for society\nYeah granted I got up and went to Walmart the next morning and people are cutting you off to get to the best parking spot and you're like well yup I'm help\nAlison hang on to the second I Want to get your copy of my book I signed it I'll send it out to you thank you so much\nFor holding him thanks for I'm I'm sharing

marketplaces so I'm On the show here today with Andrea ... we're talking about is already a lifeline\nAnd the importance of of this particular service that's out there or southern Colorado\nWhich has been out there for a long time and how it really affects our senior so I ... thanks for coming on and sharing this with uh our listeners we we kind of need everybody to be thinking about what's going on with mom or dad\nIf something happens when no one's around\nDefinitely um and that's just that's a common issue that people don't think about these types of things that can really help seniors um stay independent and tell\nIf they're in desperate need 'em something to help because an incident has happened um and so now that they finally realized that mom or dad needs help then they're sticking these services out we want to make sure people are aware of the services before anything serious were to happen on our mom and dad is injured\nAnd and so that's why we have lifeline and me\nPromote it to the community and that's why I Do what I Do because um the the thing that everybody wants is to be as independent as possible matter what your age is and I'm\nWith the ... when you grow in Asia you you can have some issues that might lead to falls um and the major thing with the fall is that you might not be able to get up and the longer that you lay there after a fall and the where she could be injured\nAnd you know I think the scary part is is that those of us in senior care\nThat we see that it sneaks up on people oh mom is fine dads are driving around and nobody's even thinking about this until there's a fall off the porch of fall down the stairs something happens and that fall is catastrophic and changes everything mhm\nAnd so you know false are going to happen but\nI Am a real advocate of the life wide program because look it's around the neck it's it's it's it's something that\nYou have and if you fall you're not going to be wondering uh in six hours from now who's coming to visit me you know you have that immediate response and I think the sons and daughters just need to think about women think mom and dad's doing great\nBut they may have fallen and not told you and once we get into falls you know they can they can happen in series and then one day the fall is really the number one cause of why people die so ... did this is such an important topic and and this is a pretty affordable system isn't it ...\nIt definitely is and when you're considering um hospital possible hospitalizations I'm from a fallen especially laying there for a long time and\nIt's definitely something that you can be proactive with and and affordable product and that can help keep families safe and keep ... parents at home longer and independent and help the children feel more confident that mom and dad are safe at home and they don't have to worry so much because they know\nThat if they were to have a fall that um that it's just a push the button and they can get help\nAnd actually we do have a son and units that have fall detection and I'm\nSo with that technology even if somebody were to fall and hit their head and be unable to push a button and it's very accurate and get in determining a fall and will call for help and even if a button and them pushed\nSo um that's just\nThat's really great settle for under fifty bucks a month mom or dad can still live at home even though you've got concerns about that they could still live at home they can get some help on the side\nBut if that helps not there are no one's around that they do fall for under fifty bucks a month you know you're really given them that independence that they're really seeking and then after that of course you got to you know you've got to try to mitigate that for the future but\nWhat a what a great program and and and talk about the apparatus what is it is it big as it small\nUm it's not bad and and the one with the fall detection has to be one around their neck\nAnd because that's how it detects the fall we do have some buttons that can be more on on the wrist and those are mostly for people that are more and just in that in the home\nUm by themselves sometimes and aren't really going out and about um without somebody with them\nAnd but with the ones around the neck we had some that actually are on mobile devices that people can take with them anywhere and they have all detection and on and and if they were to fall if they were at the grocery store or out for a walk in the neighborhood\nAnd it would detect that fall or they can push a button and and it has GPS locating in it so that um help would be able to find them where they are\nOkay so somebody wants to this is something that you know maybe a need for my mom and dad how do I get a set of how hard is it to get it set up at mom's house\nIt's it's very easy and again you can just call the same number that you call for that the safety of senior conference that's I mean my my number it's five for five went to one kill and\nAnd just give us your name information and we will just figure out what kind of um questions that we need from asking some kind of questions to get the information that we need 'em\nTo get you all set up and our service reps are all local so that they couldn't get out there and probably the next day and get mom or dad set up and so it's a very easy simple process and to get\nDo they like to send to the phone I mean they just have to connect it right so that it uses the phone system to be able to call so as long as there is a technical person they're they come to the home when they get that all set up so mom and dad are in good shape and that's ... that's the whole deal here yeah\nThis is good so if some of you avoided this and I know people don't want that added monthly fee and\nYou know oil I think I'll pass on that I'll just holler out for the neighbor you know I've heard all sorts of stories about that and I think it's really something that you need to think about so given that phone number one more time this is lifeline that they get something that you all should consider\nIt's five for five one two one two\nThat's great well this has really been a a I think an important part of our community that is really stretch started out in Pueblo\nTwenty six years ago and they'll look at it going all the way to Durango\nAnd and as you know Colorado would have it there are a lot of really a lot of books of grannies you'll learn a little tiny towns and\nIt's really nice because that brings technology to your town that brings technology to wherever you are yeah and the whether you're in assisted living whether you're in an independent living or at home or maybe you're living with your kids I mean what a great what a great opportunity to have that extra hand in the house for under fifty bucks a month\nYes definitely so what does that number to call once more five for five one two one two great that's so easy to remember for four or five [laughter] who wants to so\nYeah we be thinking about life wind if you don't already have it I Know that they could uh probably take care of your pretty pretty quick\nYeah and I have I did want to mention that they don't even have to have a a land line at home and we also have a mobile units and even with our new go safe to button and that doesn't have to be connected to the base unit at all so under a lot of different options depending on if they still have a home phone or if they have a mobile device\nUsing technology grant and this is the thing that amazes me all the time everything changes\nWill break we're going to take a little break right now and the senior living today show and a\nRabbit a great discussion with Andrea cracking burger about why fly in but there's another

percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um he said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans\nFifty nine percent or said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats it started with a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since ... that has changed Democrats have gone up from sixty three\nTo Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections however Republicans have jumped\nA higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight so now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would\nBe the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... two dozen six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nSo relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the\nRaces they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in ... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point\nSo all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean\nAnd they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance\nThe Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on the train in the house you're still gonna have investigative power to have subpoena power going to have in\n... it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in\nWatching the news and watching just the flow of it have you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of [noise] [noise] [noise] oh yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance at this uh two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up are and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the cabin I'll thing now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling at the ... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate\nAs you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like chipping away I'm the type of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo\nYeah but I Wonder because I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know where that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being tired light like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line that\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that is growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming\nA more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... that I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting it was sad to hear Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan\nOf of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's there's burger yeah definitely we talked a lot of them a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen to Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while it's going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\n[noise]\nIt ... I mean the only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan refugees what else has happened\nI mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages you know I was in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for it at some after okay um all the October ones obviously after including then include the migrants are caravans situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only places low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine personal and to ...\nWhere is that working out where is it protecting human rights no thank you I mean\nIslamic rule just by another group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia no thank you\nI'm going to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy\nThere was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it and we have found that\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue but let's not paint\n... into some freedom loving prince because that's not true\n... news talk on the go a diehard radio at five Ninety case yes Jane dot com and\n[noise] the check out the lens blah [laughter] five Ninety case yesterday dot com\nWord Glenn\nHow you drive do Pueblo ... you know right now you actually see the good traffic flow both north and south bound the twenty five ... or giving through town itself of course it's Monday school's starting to build a little bit of traffic on fifty east of the freeway\nHudson droid Norwood usual slowdown spots fifty ...

so the president wrote the U.S will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid\nLives meeting and happiness and so I think it's very important\nTo um as far right as they come on the right versus left to continue but it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for order liberty so that you can go live in the communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build a better mouse trap or apps\nOr where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics is a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left um they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people\nSay enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to Nancy Pelosi and California\nHunter hunting arena where does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and Kentucky exactly\n... because there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have persuasion as any goal\nThe the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing\nThat I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and are there is no anti ... hair and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with\nThinking about anti ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that that basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it\nWas shared content ...\nThere was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two\nThey're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our\nMedia as if the people like ... who are doing this to hope for a viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignored them [noise]\nSo what he is are\nAre we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually comeback to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... or ... I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we\nBelieve in law go day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God\nWith eternal souls and with dignity that's way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people\nAre not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forests\nAnd statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless\nWe can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community and I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about with deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this ah and you're looking over the horizon and we want to talk about that we are talking to Ben\nSasse his new

divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other is an awareness that there's actually a national security exposures for this country and how much we ate each other around politics we need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes

of making people better I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life liberty\nPursuit of happiness and no one talks about that I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness sorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there are there many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal\nI'd hang of it before it surely start let's start with me I should go into education\nAbsolutely on them and talking about getting rid of all standardized testing prior to high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because they're nice testing is it unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy satellites testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go where your book liberties are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and almost I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was the department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about it really do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read write\nSurvive in the world without and at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school districts did a good job somehow that worked out of the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nAnd they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready so nice testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators\nGo away and then it shows while riding granted measures were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one say nice things because I crossed the entire state might say that sixty two counties across all city to\nGet the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers the average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty among\nYou dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve many K through ten the last two years of high school for too many kids is\nJim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this\nBecause the first year of college for most kids is their teeth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college was terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say and wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is when people show up at the clock in the morning so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey gotta has a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally and the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great hospital\nAnd then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that the biology chemistry history or whatever right off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator as life is good\nI don't like that no word on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves Dr teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who them and go back to the gate sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory data okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to the degree why should they be bored in school and they should be one school\nNext you don't want any of those things now where he's going to be a trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber carp and do whatever you want to be about mechanic an H ... guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty\n... that's a problem I let my ... year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in the ocean to doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people imagine if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss lowering it means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learned that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lot of these sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth right I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck\nHis ... his wife ... going to happen\nA bunch of cool prep schools will pop up a bunch of great trade schools will pop up get that much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars going day well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what bank love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will absolute give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven sweaters is more than four billion dollars\nWe said all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nTo allow use of marijuana in any business serving

owners in New York state if not more well how do they need insurance now when\nWhen when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant\nSay fact was passed and twenty Thirteen and the the fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before completely totally above board you are now a violent selling it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes oh the cops who are said to revamp the because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop once you retire when you're a felon again\nBecause you know we're not going to come up this is this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy constantly project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's

I knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in his ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nAs it\nTurns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this\nHappened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent um but it\nLooks as though he was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went\nRogue ... but it's kind of hard to believe\n[noise] the new information today you know is this coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly or last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead\nUm but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then\nThe Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation torture and killing\nI don't know\nIf they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if the Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it's finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true\nFor her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if as if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh\nThe the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in\nHere or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you'd need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true [noise] this\nMay be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that sets the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire\nBut Saudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia we're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen\nUm we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of more machinery to Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is quietly supportive of of ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel they are also a an ally with us against Iran they are a balance of power\nIf this tape exists and this tape comes out we have all known that\nSaudi Arabia is a bad place but we have not heard the screams\nIf this tape exists and comes out people of the world will for ever think of Saudi Arabia and put them in the same class as Stalin as Hitler as Mabhouh or as Kim Jong moon\nAh in in uh\nNorth Korea but we remember North Korea's crimes we only have sketches of\nIf this tape exists and comes out it's a game changer that could destabilize everything will go back into the\nStory in a second first let me tell you our sponsor is one eight hour one eight hundred flowers dot com the

very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we deal with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure to not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation and you better take this tape seriously\nBecause if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and Tom to everybody down\nAnd then what everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you do you do the tape because that's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not friends of ours they are not friends of ours\nThey are selling us crap that quite honestly I

know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\n[noise] why do it peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little

it's growing in America which is you know what killing the ashes really essentially about\nAnd and a lot of people still want to look away at it they they don't want to engage and um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive the most and art\nIn our society the press sympathizes with all of them they sympathize with open

this um\nUh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties or some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say a a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... march for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nA that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties the press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody\nElse will take a cell phone video and throw it out there just what happened is that an over the weekend is ...\nAnd then he grew up doing that would have to hire security\nThey'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes it takes leadership it takes organization but but on the press thing look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press\nIs actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes solidly still try to do with Trump into basically dismissing\nSaudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad but Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran\nIn the middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism and\nDestruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American laugh wanna destroy\nThat nation when in history we outlawed herself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nPictures and send them to them and they they'll actually look at them and help

calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com basin right\nMore than likely the full three years of the ISIS occupation and muzzle and they were done they wanted to leave they wanted to get out of there because as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS you know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so\nLiving behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolutely health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that day there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of societies that true [noise]\nWe did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there um and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground\nYou know and and it it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWere seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is good they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because you know they look like me they're white guys read ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so\nYeah so you went from that um to are saying I I've got to do I've got to keep doing this ... um and that brought you to Burma mhm right yes and now you're working\nWith an as rain fun yes in Burma yes and last week talked you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update forth yes absolutely so\nAh also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from than as her infant or ... you were telling me that you were trying to organize a mattress people yes and you were going to bring them all together slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago\nAnd met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border and\nThey they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to have the ... okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist looking out all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's really really good thing um\n[noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their eyes are done several trips with the ... fund in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to have us because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the ... army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people\nAlive so why why are they doing this why are they doing this to these\nTribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic Berman to control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject a surf class you have to basically serve the ... and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just as a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because we're there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacked them even more\nTell me what you wrote me so I brought a brought with me several photos\nHave somebody I'm over his mercy its best they're apologizing for getting so I brought with me [noise] several photos of of what I see all the time when I go to these places [noise]\nAnd these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\nOf of one particular um attack that happened um this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you had any photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos you see dead civilians you see\nKids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage is their intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a baby and that's a baby\nIntentionally and killed and the baby didn't die right away I'd survived for about twenty four hours and then died and this just looks like it's in the woods yeah they're out in the jungle these people have nothing and warm army still wants to attack them and take more from them and so every time I go there every time\nThe ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and\nI Can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the artist for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives\nAnd a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the arm army him and his family have fled the Burma Army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the jungle in the middle of nowhere um\nHe he heard that the other end fund was there and he came and found me and he said hey I Want to I Want to I Want to thank you please come to my house for dinner tonight so they gave me on a motorcycle and I drive at this man's house in the middle of nowhere\nWhen I get in there his wife is cooking pigs that for me to eat because that's the big fat and rice and ... and ... and so we're sitting there and he's like hey I I when I was like I Wish I had more to give you a he's like this is all I have for a snack and he pulls out a bag and it's literally tree bark it's bark from a tree\nAnd he's like this is all we have the snack on while my wife prepares food and he gave me\nTree bark to eat and I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this guy and she has nothing is literally nothing\nAnd she wanted to give me a tree bark because that was the best that he had and so I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark but this man\nAnd I I was I was so overcome was just like I\n... his gratitude at the level of gratitude he showed for us for that for the ... being there it was it was unbelievable it was so touching and then later on as I was leaving as I was leaving the jungle another man barely speak any English\nUm he's um I'm On a motorcycle and he's driving me out of the jungle and he ... he as he is driving he turns me he says thank you and I said oh\nLike oh you good English or what I'm trying to paint him and talk more about um um I'm about what what use more English and so I was like oh like what what do you what are you grateful for what do you know yeah and he's like is that this is amazing he said thank you for giving my people hope [laughter]\nSo I had someone else's head I mean is so on display with CNN right now they\nCan't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia Trump Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia he's in trouble you know two or does Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\nHow they can they caught somebody up alive alive they butchered him alive caught him up and\nPut them in a suitcase and you're looking for a way an angle to get\nTrump what is wrong with you people that's wrong with\nThe it was like legitimately like a sickness for some of them I thought if not CNN but I mean it is it as a network\nAs a whole they can't\nFigure out a way to discuss any other topic is really incredible I mean he really does dominate to their lives every aspect or at least there's at least they're public life I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about it all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just looked at the headline at Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally\nAgain like all of these stories like the Elizabeth Warren thing is is interesting 'cause she's gonna be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean a real flop eared what we're talking about when the all time political flops yes she's tried\nShe has to come and get ahead of this or again it is a ... it's an important political story for somebody who is going to run for president yeah\nBut really with Saudi Arabia [noise] going on right now with that and what that possibly means should we take a pause and we'll get some of the stock market anybody know why anybody talking about that why is it now\nCheck out the lens blog got five dining case yes J. dot com back\nWednesday October Seventy one years down the Bree I our radio asked her radio podcast video featuring a brand new episode with the legendary served\nPaul McCartney [laughter] no I'm In ... to all of this film with Joel leaving was talking about his new album Egypt Station then of course some discussion about a little band called the beat off we were when we were playing music radios inside the studio by checking out\nThe ... D be right here [noise]\n\nIn fact Linda [noise]\nLove new program so glad that you are here um we're going on tour here soon and we would love to see you grab your tickets now to Glenn Beck dot com tour were coming to a theater near you it's Richmond Hershey Pittsburgh Cleveland Kansas City uh\nTulsa Tampa Orlando and other cities around you make sure that you grab your tickets or you can do to Glenn Beck dot com slash tour a we're going to see if you\nCan spend as much as a democratic socialist game show that I don't think you can win no no I think we all lose in the end and you know the sad\nPart of the sometimes do Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big win for Republicans really and we're seeing a case of this here it appears in Texas where Beto O'Rourke or Robert Francis or if you know as his parents wanted him to be known\n'em is going by as\nHe used to call themselves going right when it was cool when it when it's beneficial\nTo be called Bobby called himself Bob yeah now he calls himself All right so Beto\nIs running here in Texas and if you don't have a new haven't seen that you haven't been watching\nA any national media as far as not just politics I'm outside of that Ellen and cold there ... you have and hurry where CNN town hall coming up tonight just him um again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base out of thirty eight million dollars\nAnd going to have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like Cruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we noticed could change but\nWell they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK and that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have and I never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the is the margin now with cruise leading\nBy seven points this is from by the way the same company that is hosting the town hall with better tonight CNN at their poll faint you forty five\nI think he wins by twelve and maybe as high as a team\nI mean that would be a real surprise or no it would be but you know that one is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe believe the polls here in Texas you know it'd be great if he won it'd be won by\nThree but I I just think that there is this something that ah you know when you get when you when you get right down to it Texans are going to say yeah I ... I\nTend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean a nine or ten is definitely possible\nInteresting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for governor here in Texas\nIs winning by a much larger margin a usually is or I don't have the one in right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points yeah every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's so much he's up by age Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were Abbott is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll\nIs it the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um ... you'd think a great read country right in Texas mhm however uh the poll\nShows that fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters where it's a forty nine\nForty eight but still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas\nLook at it this way try this on for size or a Donald Trump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we not talking about today and I know in talking about the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "17", "locations": [["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["London",

I think he just he contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff\nMember of the Washington Post columnist wasn't any or he'd written it's relatively new yeah because he left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new\nAnd you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean ... that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize on with that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one with the biggest political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty years ago and he's all outage and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about four they been\nOur allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them\nTo exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way that Brock Obama would have done anything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point now there wouldn't have done anything about this it's a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage\nToday the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker\nWho is tense of right I mean remember good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again\nThe big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before\nHe ... he walked out of the room remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as the bad guy who who's ... who's incompetent\nBrock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years since the Harlem Harlem me there was a decision made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision and in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand and one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was a risk in the mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean it you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options in and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally\nIf for Rocco bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who's a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is our this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nOr potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your own self but something happened there and ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't there are more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still well that'd be age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune his reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nUh actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ... um Saudi Arabia publicly pledged payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into\nOh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars of course\nThere are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] that our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that kind of I mean look at it it's not completely in significant\nTo the relationship right I mean that there was there are these considerations and that is why when you're making a decision as the president of the United states your decision is not solely based\nOn you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day\nAmerican interests are harmed long term\nBy a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your\nTop priority is not a ... murders in Turkey right like\nThe beginning right out of anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore such studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things all over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a\nIf you'd be pissed off of ... yeah they'll call us mass that we're not as we are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called jak you what do you are on the commercial on a jaguar\nWhat it's like they like if you come up with a name on your own\nMaybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced but what is a word\nWe already know and when I say you were a hundred years it stop it we it's an animal yes and they're not just a car it's an animal to right every citizen jak you are [laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that the I think that's jak you are\nTrying to seem refined right\nLike this like um there's something nothing a little snooty about the way they pronounce ... er jaguars like at the stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog\nAnd then this Yankee water [laughter] would you be gone [laughter] exactly where they're ripping up by a bitter and into my dog is terrible I but luckily I felt with my bones on top of it so everything's gonna be okay [laughter]\nThat happens is you know ... three times last week alone for me and it was

you know do you have some very modest [laughter] so we'll see how that turns out we'll give you the updates when we get them or we need to warn you about\nSomething that's incredibly dangerous in our society and all too prevalent in that's a Disney Princess is um we're being worn by ah some Hollywood actresses that there is some danger there Karen nightly\nIs promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the four realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values ... so she is forbidden her three year old daughter ... from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is\nA been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her and she says don't rescue yourself obviously\nAnd this is the one I'm but she ... she's mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and there's not really as a self yes she didn't pull herself out of that situation she's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man\nOr a man yeah thank you mhm there's a lot of women are doing that today\nThe main message ... or ... of really the entire movie is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them to rescue a especially a rash of rich guy that's\nThe message you should be taking from those movies I'm Christian bell is also fearful that Disney princes are sending the wrong message to her children she's actually the voice of the Disney Princess uh Anna and frozen wasn't that done by Christian Bale yes [laughter]\nSo she tells her daughter's Lincoln and delta that ah when she ... when she read Snow White del taco bell\nYes and Lincoln bell yes and when she read Snow White two inch closes up the book and she says every time we close no white I looked at my girls and ask don't you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple\nI say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no\nI'm like okay I'm doing something right yeah you've proved it\nA while you nailed that one there did wrist and then she'll also say and\nGirls don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission\nWell no because she's in a coma mom [laughter] can't camera permission and she'll stay in a column I ... doesn't cancer\nRight I mean she's advocating for the government could continue right the gangs are out of it\nRight and bell says uh because you can't kiss someone if they're sleeping\nOn how does that mean in my circumstances that's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book right the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's\nA magical apple\nThere's a a a print or with a magical spell right on the princess yes and she's sleeping because she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's kind of the premise\nThat yeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that part of your lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird I even get yourself still worked up about the you know what I Hope happens every day it every day when she brings breakfast to them they ask her where did this\n[laughter]\nThey just torture her with the rest of her life [laughter] 'cause I can understand this you know sometimes I think even\nYou know ... like conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things are like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon because we're watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it's like I Know it was a captain planet or whatever and all of that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about

version of Sleeping Beauty the\nKing sneaks into sleeping beauties castle and raped her\nAnd she wakes up pregnant what yeah way what do you mean this isn't a this is amazing the original like story or the original\nStory from an Italian guy Jim ... to ... ... uh that was his original story now they took a lot of his original stories\nI'm Charles Peralta in the late seventeenth century and then the brothers Graham in the Eighteen hundreds took those stories reworked him change them a little bit but the original was like\nReally horrible when you say there he worked in the dark out on on the amounts of\nRape yeah was that was that one of the thing is that the actual assault was something they decided you know what maybe for a children's book we don't include that slightly what if we go back to ... percent yeah I Would do something like that something he'd be open to a like a hundred or a hundred percent on the\nCut back of yeah uh 'cause that's pretty amazing pretty amazing so\nEven these tainted version that we see today those are still offensive and horrible and you can't let your\nKids see him I guess um yeah it's amazing\nYeah it's it's amazing it's interesting what we what we the the way these standards change which isn't it there's a new report on Lucy K uh out today maybe with the end of that later on today or because it's interesting the standards that are being

Thirteen\nYou know play the Glenn Beck blog\nHas pretty much why I said I thought\nTo the news radio to ... ... my Tom pale and President Trump will meet today to talk about ... and Saudi Arabia and turkey about the disappearance of a Washington\nPost columnist President Trump says he's looking forward to a long talk this morning with secretary of state Mike ... just back overnight from turkey and Saudi Arabia\nI Want to find out what happened where is this fall and we will probably know that by the end of the ... neither the president I'm not sure yet that it exists probably does\nNor Palmdale we'll talk about what's reportedly of gruesome audiotape or the killing of Washington Post journalist your mark ... inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey\nSystem and when you try to go around that and you try to say well we know better than the police we know better than the investigators because I don't know it really looks bad or ah I don't know it really looks like a this was this happened\nThat that that's a terrible direction to go and lead you don't all full roads where you're trying to judge things that you can't possibly judge correctly\nYeah and it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this progress as a in a year or two or five for now with Brett Kavanaugh because there was nothing to back up\nOr his accusers claims there was no corroboration there was no evidence at all of these allegations from thirty five plus years ago\nAnd yet uh\nI just saw an article today above from ... Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice ...\nAre just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no ... and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time in the ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't care you occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know the debate still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest paid per capita\nBut I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the ... the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning the Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we don't know um\nBut the other people and Cory Booker do not care won't for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so you could call themselves Spartacus or and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and yeah and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nAnd again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but what are you judging by the standards that they're putting up\nIt's totally different ... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating\nAfter I think of how recent is Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... that story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find that Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what happened what mine of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named\nInstead came out and yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on or something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident but just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party occurred none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against or\nFive people said ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred wow so now while for one person who is at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nUh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn panty hose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days with the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape and that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Camelot and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison over there are so work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended newspaper reports suggest that Clinton was\nIn the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel window wow that is a thousand times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats and now yeah you'll see\nOccasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after\nThey never want to hear about either one of their uh stories ever get to them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them but I mean Bill Clinton goes on is still makes a\nBig level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre and the fact that they that the media\nActually thinks we should take their current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when you report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system with\nActual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened I mean that is what that the system we have is the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we are now supposed to go through these kinds of records and an even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it is now or standard that can sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is some actual evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's tried to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated a reception\nOf Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy as they are so pissed off about that and they don't want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then Michael up and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad they'd even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other night I took on Hillary Clinton and you know to

I'm ... with traffic [noise]\nYou're listening to Glenda program with patents do triple eight Seventy Seventy easy Kay [noise] uh there's this\nThere's an interesting thing for the New York times today and it is they do this little\nPod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm well you did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah none of them they said yes that are part of this dug up with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something\nThat against motives will write like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where\nUm he [noise]\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure in himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics hour to an absolutely yeah the power to make it makes you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he's in ... he wields incredible power right in this country now incredibly led to have her\nFired at any job in the nation and giving any job you're a sarcasm is just reality and the situation I got to go away it only what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them people were other comedians\nAnd one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there or something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was because this is his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a\nWife or the child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're\nRight I have issues and that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation\nHe asked her to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I I have issues I'm Sorry\nBut that is is that sexual assault what I mean the accusation there are no amateur watched what she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right and he admitted in such a\nGeneral way that people kind of a make eating people he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make the make them right and I think that that\nWould I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no\nAnd and they and the idea that you\nKnow Lucy K because he's a famous uh\nComedian can affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nThat he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again he's making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the focus scares away from right you're not supposed to just as the other and people will commit crimes in the future\nSo down and listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedians I never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks into does the ... or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while because that are loose the gay woman and it doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's bounced around to several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times there's an exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner about why you\nLet him on stage this is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision\nWas some other people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy and he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like\nNever mhm might never says never\nWell can you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence and never work again he says I don't care never misses an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a place where you would say particularly to a female customer who is somebody that's on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton\nThe idea that this is a right wing phenomenon I mean it just seems like people who are on the right pay the price for it where people on the left you know don't necessarily see that the same way and you know I think you have to get to a point\nWhere someone like Lucy K who was I think are accused could correctly of being a dirt bag right who was in it to his own admission but\nNot not any nothing that was over this line of sexual assault at least it's\nNot as reported you know you have to look at these\nThings as they said I mean these are is now doing shows again um and he was a he was accused of something um you know what's his face from the New York times he's back\nOr the Glen or what the heck is his name you know to get it wrong thrush right used of uh of harassing a young interns and other underlings and he he's back at work\nWe have this weird saying why I mean Mike Tyson\nIt's pretty clear the man was convicted of rape not not accurate time convicted of rape spent time in prison yeah and he's like the darling of the media he comes out of you guys it's silly appearances we have a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he's I mean and look he served time and he's out right now\nUm and so you can make the case as the left has made forever that people who go in felons you'll be able to come back and vote you should be we their programs to give felons in convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accuse if he is yeah it really doesn't make any sense AAA seven twenty seven back is\nThe phone number or it is a pat and sue for Glenn who\nUh is traverse ing currently or the Mediterranean Sea in a canoe or he's always wanted to do it and he finally said you know what this is a week so

it\nWell do you how did he lie what do you lie about it he said he drink to excess from time to time yep\nWhat are you lie about the idea is that we're all other because other people around and we're like well I think he ... people did blackout how the hell the you know you're not only he would know that right uh you know and maybe he did I I don't see how that all that ah\nThere's no way to know that and to the conversation but still there's no way to know what if the ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the subtle\nAccusation that everyone who supported Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person\nEven from people like you know there are people in the left but you know I'm sure a restaurant I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is\nThey accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want them on the Supreme Court\nRight and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her your prerogative but you don't accuse me of a bowl of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened yeah\nI don't either and it hadn't been I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe believing that is so is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't fair but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official\nOr in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades then talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who\nWere there and they can't remember the party like what are we and the person who's making the accusation has an overt uh dislike for\nThe party of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is march women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like you have to take in motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea basically I think people almost like it's going to sound bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor the indicate that this this has occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would I ever called the victim I called them survivor but then I wouldn't they Levi\n... survived this assault by this man if they've assault didn't happen they didn't survive it and [laughter] you know I guess we could all call herself survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so far life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... million things are possible you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one mhm possibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nNot whether they should like this I don't know when I taught at school we talk\nAbout uh yeah I Know we talk about\nThe the women's right to choose it is just fainted as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one I wouldn't defend my children's lives\nAs strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children\nHit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans the idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right\nThat you think is so vital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five five accusers accused of high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay this happens all the time you know why\nPeople are horrible\nMany of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things\nThat you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing a swastika on their door for nothing you can like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused we can they do we know\nFor a fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them we know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or when it happened we know that the third accuser which I'm Michael ... and no\nOne including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first two\nAnd in the second one is the is that there's a ... they're right when they the person who made the allegation\nSaid I I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen\nAnd she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly\nThat's the old act on Sunday ... operating what evidence on that one either and they're ... and look the Fort one was only I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people they're just with no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In and of course obviously people a cabin on his uh his or what this is worth saying no um but\nThat one was serious because she went in to you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing relatively credible\nJob it recounting what she believed the story was who knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the like\nState who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's just completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you can do it I mean that as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said they were they vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this like the media access if this is entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter]\nI Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd you you brought up to high school situation in California where they call it the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault\nOr and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk I don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him the credits didn't like him to really encourage\nI cannot hold up I wouldn't think so but the the the community as a plotting the police swift success the swift excessive locating interesting him\nIs due to the timely information provided by numerous concern teens and adults as well as the cooperation of the park ridge police department and the cook county sheriff's bleak ... is this what was he was a a multi\nDepartment good uh operation and she'd get this kid we did this story come around no do we here at the end but by the way they found out it was an air soft gun and now he's you know this story you know ...\nCause I mean it let's just say you had a realistic looking air soft gun ... that media lost it a little are you I assume they all have the orange thing on the end yes just bakery no let's just say that fell off or something or you can eat it at blackberry what'd you say\nHe's walking down the street or he's walking towards the school I can understand someone passing by me like a what the hell's going on and sharing the police yeah and what happens if they show up\nAnd they talk to them they owe generic ... I think are the orange piece of people are gonna freak out and then you release them right let's say a max the maximum penalty but we will look we're going to take the gun will return it to you later\nInstead they found the ... gun in his truck and arrested him for disturbing the Peace Did they realize it was an air so yeah they knew it was in ... they said it was an air soft gun and they're they're still\nBeing congratulated for their sweet success [laughter] oh man that I don't know\nI don't know what are you going to do with an ... I mean if you shot somebody in the eyes yeah you're supposed to work out those right when you're wearing yeah that would hurt ha ha ha you might put an eye out my mom warns me more than me about that a word that was a kid\nUm but other than that\nI I don't know what you're going to do with yourself gun that's so dangerous that they had their arrest the kid when they found out it's an air so I've gotten\nBut he wasn't even walking down the street he posted a photo you didn't on right now buddy\nDidn't didn't say I'm going to use this at school and none of that\nVery bizarre Mm\nCheck out the lens blog five Ninety case yes J. dot com and keyboard banging\nOn the next episode of death ride global pod cast with Arianna Huffington she discusses our beliefs are influenced by the power of storytelling Howard touched by news and white creating boundaries is crucial for six that\nDr Wilbur pod cast is brought to you by sleep number this leak number ... on each side is perfect for both you and your partner experienced the sweet number bang exclusively at one of their five hundred and fifty stores nationwide\nChecked him out its number dot com slash dry\nFall pick that perfect Halloween costume by your candy weren't\nPerfect soundtrack to help you with all those activities we\nRadio and I are radio\nWe've all seen that moment in movie credits that says no animals were harmed and then they can still\nComes and goes pretty quickly so much goes into making sure that happened [noise] film director I rely on the eight decades have experienced American Humane brings to safeguarding [noise]\nWork starts well before we ever sell to consult scripts advise patients\nProvide guidance on training veterinary care workplace safety and much more [noise]\nCan mean upset making sure we get rain\nToday their mission is more important than ever\nBecause when you were director of making movies\nShow a Web series music video or commercial\nDang passionate people as Americans\nAnd\nIt's the worst they made a ...
