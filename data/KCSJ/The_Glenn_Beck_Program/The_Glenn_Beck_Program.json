them this is the story of the Jewish people just survive\n\nThat's why the nation of Israel exist if people don't understand that is why no one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so\nThe world just cited let them have this scrap of land they say was there as because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as for told\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and Stalin could concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud of who they were they could finally live\n\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society is the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews\nAnd a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews\nBut people of all faiths all faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\n\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\n\nIs the answer couldn't be more perfect\n\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish\n\nWe help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization\nThat I'm mad man went into Philadelphia\nTo try to stop\nThis is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue story never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the

true\nYou know that would be easiest thing in the world right now sure sure it is sure it is\nThis uh this weekend a I had to really I really had a difficult time uh I mean I just\nDid you guys watch the news all this we can't know as little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting 'cause it's like I get the updates but yeah\nYeah so only to get the updates and stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore\nYeah I I never watch cable news never my the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews can't or oh the N n my heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN jet why don't you\nDon't have those I don't know who's doing that and they do I really don't know who's your\nFans watch Fox you know 'cause it's a safe haven mostly unless you're watches Shepard Smith\nUh [laughter] but that's always been that way but I don't know I'm just\nCNN I don't know who does cause that's it's on watch\nAll the people who hate Trump right yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on it for the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly I if I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to them talk about early do now synagogue thing is he's\nOh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's ... Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of very slowly but surely but he's like you know did he he didn't go there have you dealt with today is the first question was ah you know but what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I Lived in a country\nAs a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning sender in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well\nWhat what what part of of that you think is is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter a outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah we did not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't find them to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment but it has nothing to do with this and all\nThese cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nThat really is really that's what they we never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever the guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot\nAll of the geo ... and another guy and tried to try these trained to kill thirty Republican seat that's tenth of the Republican paint on was working\nFor Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not they didn't even talk about\nIt because they they had a very balanced view of that one for a understood that individuals were responsible for their own actions that time was re understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them and and they always complain about discourse isn't that a great example is terrible discourse yes\nWe can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the pipe bomb think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt 'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individual shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not use ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why Rob Pat Pat in this morning is because uh you know he sees doing more on trivia and\nUh and for a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nYeah it's it you know it's a chance to get away from the discourse for a little wire like an hour a week as and just be maintained yeah interest me mean to\nNo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know that when I'm never going to end on that one\nAnd in fact repeat it ah it consistently gets repeated a it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nWell thank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's Sunday you\nKnow we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really 'cause I have a free tickets but seriously oh now all of a sudden you're in maybe it can change that I can you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ...\nThat would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you or what it is it's Sunday\nA Cleveland I think it Sunday yes it's going back to ... tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ... it's going to be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff\nYou were given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the ... turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nIs that it does\nAnd a Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and and comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of the proceeds from\nThe I'm from the event and um we're giving them to I'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to\nOr to the uh the refugee um oh yeah a group I'm not sure we are going to give 'em to yet but we're we're uh we're\nWe're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um to a a local Jewish um center perhaps the\nThe synagogue and I'm not sure they're not stance from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I notice you went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros stream into\nA and I remember [laughter] and you came back after this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know\nAnd then she posted here's an example of supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros uh as as an example of how much you hate the Jews\nNow I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel award [laughter] that was I thought that's really national award what are the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people crying but beyond that uh it was just it was just presented\nBy the the prime minister of Israel though\nOh well that's it [laughter] it's all okay that's not a big one that out of bed quite a big one so\nIt's just amazing you know 'cause this is not just the criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a ... a conservative and I ...\nThe people in this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them would criticize drug stores but they criticize him because he's a liberal has progressive policies he supports a policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him if I wanted him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history or around the world\nThat but anti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew the same way they don't\nLike been Shapiro because in front of a hero party the policies you know like I don't understand the racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx\nHe was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew now but because he came up with the idea of communism I I'm not a fan no not a fan\nOf fat and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized venture Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said\nThey will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal\nAnd they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know they cannot do it and I it's not all under state it they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite\nWe you're telling me the way the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who was one of the biggest finance here's the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\n... it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas this legal opinion because they don't support what they believe\nIt's not about it it is trying to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a\nA ... ... again this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're killing everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they say\nIt anyway because they don't care [noise]\nThat that that is exactly what they think they claimed to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there too [noise]\nYeah I felt a battering I don't know what I have a good point and ah we're we're going to talk about one when we come back\nCheck out the lens blog five Ninety Days yes J. dot com and keyword

place\nAre we sincerely which are week we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice isn't it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both we're both\nWe've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell was paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America\nAnd not just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\n\nWhy is the constitution were fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on I I'm I we\nCannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line like climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth okay that's a value\nThat's not climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the\nIce age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion and ... and in the scientific field\nYou give me clean cut studies okay\n\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it see they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work\nNow that is a political discussion that is a political discussion you\nKnow where our values come in on that particular discussion when someone says the sciences settled is shut up that flew violation of our values\nWhen people sit down at the table and say look I care about the environment I really do I disagree with the science and here the people on my side that are showing you that this is ... this this collusion\nEnd that yours yours system that you're you're you're you're you're touting is nothing more than a political system\nAnd it doesn't work\nThat's a political discussion those are the things we should have what brings us together at the end\nOr the values\nWe both care about your who doesn't care about the earth sincerely who doesn't care about the earth and I'm tired of being lectured by people who will go and protest and leave us see of garbage buying them for others to keep and clean up\nI'm sick of it don't tell me you care about the environment and then after a protest everything is not about litter\nYou either care about it or you don't words don't mean anything anymore only actions do don't tell me what you believe show me what you believe\nMad country or a good country that's that's the question we have that [noise] is the western\nWay of life we're saving is it good is it nothing about a bunch of ... gender males white males white Europeans that of oppressed people\nIs that is that all is that all it is\nCan I ask you do when you think World War two officially started when did it really start start so not our involvement of yeah not our involvement uh gosh I mean the date I'm not going to get ready or just give me an event [noise]\nTough one uh\nWould you say Germany invades Poland or you know breaks the it's rainy with you know I mean I'm sure you do to a judge Chamberlain or ... ... so you're talking events that lead to weather events I mean you could go on for a million different places and that\nAnd I'll give you I'll give you one how about when Japan invaded China happened in thirty seven if you live on that side of the earth yeah you'll think World War two started then Japan invaded China\nManchuria and they said the only problem was Manchuria is all the ... Mm that sounds familiar\nOr and so they invaded and they started a mass slaughter mass slaughter\nAll of the you know the bad bombings of civilians that happened ... years before we were doing it or the Germans were doing it and how it started in thirty seven in China with the Japanese where was the white man\nNo you know where the white man was you know how history reflects that's now America didn't say anything at the time America didn't step up to the plate and stop the slaughter in China\nSo wait a minute hold it just a second so are we supposed to get involved in everything or are we not supposed to be involved and everything when we get involved you blame us for getting involved in saying we're trying to jam our stuff down everybody's\nThroat when we don't show up you blame us for not showing up either way according to you we violated quilt our values\n\nWhat our values\nOur values used to be we our enemy of no one friend all now that gets a little dicey\nGets really dicey didn't get dicey apparently when the Japanese invaded China\nYeah that's because they only care about Europe no actually no we couldn't fight on all of the friends\nHad to choose we didn't even want to go save Europe America didn't even want to go into war well how could you\nOh my gosh how could you that Europe [noise] wait a minute\nWe're supposed to go to save the white patriarchy where ... wait a minute we are to blame for all of that because we didn't go in and save the white hierarchy I thought you just said that was bad should be destroyed um\nIs America bad or good let's have that

broadcast but then we don't make a tangible\nAnd even you were saying that you haven't been doing it shows you haven't been out of the road for a while I think it's going to be so good for you because you need to connect with the people yes I agree\nMy friend and I generally of I had a a friend of mine that's a Vietnam veteran in his seventies and we went all the way we live in Ashland, Kentucky we got up at\nTwo AM drove six hours to Illinois for it that the Trump rally this weekend on Saturday and\nAnd then stood for eleven hours straight because we were told the first two thousand people in line would get into the hangar and we knew we were going to get that way and and as it got through security and looking at George saying oh I Can't wait to sit down and you get to the hangar there were no states so there's a reality of we're going to be standing another six hours on concrete\nSo when I was saying is this president is a lawyer I'm Sorry I just play that just playing the Brazilian go ahead tell us or\nI could say it as much as they want you know what we were standing in line making fun of the Carbondale a solidarity network which was a socialist group that was coming to protest they had to have their eleven AM pancake breakfast before they came to protest and you know we ... we were joking well do you think there were a vegan and gluten free options to go along with that and\nRight but there were over ten thousand people there for the rally unless they Seventy five people showed up to protest\nThere was not a piece of heard you say this about your ... function is when you've had the restoring functions\nThere was no garbage we he would never know when I was ten thousand people there no one was complaining I was kind of had to warm up to Trump myself and I wasn't tend to get to go to one of these things because I was afraid if I said one negative thing I was going to be completely shouted down\nNo people were so open about talking and\nYou know someone had to go to the bathroom and in their their child stayed with us I mean you're in a group of ten thousand people you trust strangers to watch your child while while you may run and do an errand a comeback real quick it was it was such a positive environment\nYou know it's like a president this happened to show up [laughter] it was\nI and I'm so glad he's actually going to be in Huntington on friday which has five miles away from where I live I'm so glad I went to Illinois because I remember standing in line and seeing the the headline break about the shooting mhm and wait we also went through the doubt of whether the president was going to show up or not\nAnd this is after we got in the hangar it we'd been standing there for two hours but we never gave up hope and we were we we all know we we had jokes of you know conservatives the one thing liberals can do better than us is chance we can't can't it's like when you classes or something\nI Know we saw it and I'm really glad we got [laughter]\nBut you know it's it was such a positive environment and our legs were or just\nKilling us by the time that he got there\nAnd George not drove back that night it was at twenty eight our road trip that we took for the experience\nAnd as exhausted as we were in as much as we were a gang George looks at me and says he's doing one in Missouri later this week as and they how far is that well that was that what it was just six hours Missouri was going to be eight but we were going to go until we found out that this one was going to happen right across the river on friday\nSo fight like angel ... that's the best I can say is go and meet these other people\nTend to Seventy five\n... ... were very quiet people but when you do cut to this rally and there there was just an energy that was there that you realized we can be there's hope for society\nYeah granted I got up and went to Walmart the next morning and people are cutting you off to get to the best parking spot and you're like well yup I'm help\nAlison hang on to the second I Want to get your copy of my book I signed it I'll send it out to you thank you so much\nFor holding him thanks for I'm I'm sharing

marketplaces so I'm On the show here today with Andrea ... we're talking about is already a lifeline\nAnd the importance of of this particular service that's out there or southern Colorado\nWhich has been out there for a long time and how it really affects our senior so I ... thanks for coming on and sharing this with uh our listeners we we kind of need everybody to be thinking about what's going on with mom or dad\nIf something happens when no one's around\nDefinitely um and that's just that's a common issue that people don't think about these types of things that can really help seniors um stay independent and tell\nIf they're in desperate need 'em something to help because an incident has happened um and so now that they finally realized that mom or dad needs help then they're sticking these services out we want to make sure people are aware of the services before anything serious were to happen on our mom and dad is injured\nAnd and so that's why we have lifeline and me\nPromote it to the community and that's why I Do what I Do because um the the thing that everybody wants is to be as independent as possible matter what your age is and I'm\nWith the ... when you grow in Asia you you can have some issues that might lead to falls um and the major thing with the fall is that you might not be able to get up and the longer that you lay there after a fall and the where she could be injured\nAnd you know I think the scary part is is that those of us in senior care\nThat we see that it sneaks up on people oh mom is fine dads are driving around and nobody's even thinking about this until there's a fall off the porch of fall down the stairs something happens and that fall is catastrophic and changes everything mhm\nAnd so you know false are going to happen but\nI Am a real advocate of the life wide program because look it's around the neck it's it's it's it's something that\nYou have and if you fall you're not going to be wondering uh in six hours from now who's coming to visit me you know you have that immediate response and I think the sons and daughters just need to think about women think mom and dad's doing great\nBut they may have fallen and not told you and once we get into falls you know they can they can happen in series and then one day the fall is really the number one cause of why people die so ... did this is such an important topic and and this is a pretty affordable system isn't it ...\nIt definitely is and when you're considering um hospital possible hospitalizations I'm from a fallen especially laying there for a long time and\nIt's definitely something that you can be proactive with and and affordable product and that can help keep families safe and keep ... parents at home longer and independent and help the children feel more confident that mom and dad are safe at home and they don't have to worry so much because they know\nThat if they were to have a fall that um that it's just a push the button and they can get help\nAnd actually we do have a son and units that have fall detection and I'm\nSo with that technology even if somebody were to fall and hit their head and be unable to push a button and it's very accurate and get in determining a fall and will call for help and even if a button and them pushed\nSo um that's just\nThat's really great settle for under fifty bucks a month mom or dad can still live at home even though you've got concerns about that they could still live at home they can get some help on the side\nBut if that helps not there are no one's around that they do fall for under fifty bucks a month you know you're really given them that independence that they're really seeking and then after that of course you got to you know you've got to try to mitigate that for the future but\nWhat a what a great program and and and talk about the apparatus what is it is it big as it small\nUm it's not bad and and the one with the fall detection has to be one around their neck\nAnd because that's how it detects the fall we do have some buttons that can be more on on the wrist and those are mostly for people that are more and just in that in the home\nUm by themselves sometimes and aren't really going out and about um without somebody with them\nAnd but with the ones around the neck we had some that actually are on mobile devices that people can take with them anywhere and they have all detection and on and and if they were to fall if they were at the grocery store or out for a walk in the neighborhood\nAnd it would detect that fall or they can push a button and and it has GPS locating in it so that um help would be able to find them where they are\nOkay so somebody wants to this is something that you know maybe a need for my mom and dad how do I get a set of how hard is it to get it set up at mom's house\nIt's it's very easy and again you can just call the same number that you call for that the safety of senior conference that's I mean my my number it's five for five went to one kill and\nAnd just give us your name information and we will just figure out what kind of um questions that we need from asking some kind of questions to get the information that we need 'em\nTo get you all set up and our service reps are all local so that they couldn't get out there and probably the next day and get mom or dad set up and so it's a very easy simple process and to get\nDo they like to send to the phone I mean they just have to connect it right so that it uses the phone system to be able to call so as long as there is a technical person they're they come to the home when they get that all set up so mom and dad are in good shape and that's ... that's the whole deal here yeah\nThis is good so if some of you avoided this and I know people don't want that added monthly fee and\nYou know oil I think I'll pass on that I'll just holler out for the neighbor you know I've heard all sorts of stories about that and I think it's really something that you need to think about so given that phone number one more time this is lifeline that they get something that you all should consider\nIt's five for five one two one two\nThat's great well this has really been a a I think an important part of our community that is really stretch started out in Pueblo\nTwenty six years ago and they'll look at it going all the way to Durango\nAnd and as you know Colorado would have it there are a lot of really a lot of books of grannies you'll learn a little tiny towns and\nIt's really nice because that brings technology to your town that brings technology to wherever you are yeah and the whether you're in assisted living whether you're in an independent living or at home or maybe you're living with your kids I mean what a great what a great opportunity to have that extra hand in the house for under fifty bucks a month\nYes definitely so what does that number to call once more five for five one two one two great that's so easy to remember for four or five [laughter] who wants to so\nYeah we be thinking about life wind if you don't already have it I Know that they could uh probably take care of your pretty pretty quick\nYeah and I have I did want to mention that they don't even have to have a a land line at home and we also have a mobile units and even with our new go safe to button and that doesn't have to be connected to the base unit at all so under a lot of different options depending on if they still have a home phone or if they have a mobile device\nUsing technology grant and this is the thing that amazes me all the time everything changes\nWill break we're going to take a little break right now and the senior living today show and a\nRabbit a great discussion with Andrea cracking burger about why fly in but there's another

percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um he said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans\nFifty nine percent or said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats it started with a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since ... that has changed Democrats have gone up from sixty three\nTo Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections however Republicans have jumped\nA higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight so now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would\nBe the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... two dozen six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nSo relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the\nRaces they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in ... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point\nSo all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean\nAnd they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance\nThe Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on the train in the house you're still gonna have investigative power to have subpoena power going to have in\n... it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in\nWatching the news and watching just the flow of it have you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of [noise] [noise] [noise] oh yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance at this uh two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up are and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the cabin I'll thing now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling at the ... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate\nAs you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like chipping away I'm the type of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo\nYeah but I Wonder because I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know where that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being tired light like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line that\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that is growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming\nA more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... that I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting it was sad to hear Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan\nOf of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's there's burger yeah definitely we talked a lot of them a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen to Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while it's going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\n[noise]\nIt ... I mean the only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan refugees what else has happened\nI mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages you know I was in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for it at some after okay um all the October ones obviously after including then include the migrants are caravans situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only places low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine personal and to ...\nWhere is that working out where is it protecting human rights no thank you I mean\nIslamic rule just by another group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia no thank you\nI'm going to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy\nThere was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it and we have found that\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue but let's not paint\n... into some freedom loving prince because that's not true\n... news talk on the go a diehard radio at five Ninety case yes Jane dot com and\n[noise] the check out the lens blah [laughter] five Ninety case yesterday dot com\nWord Glenn\nHow you drive do Pueblo ... you know right now you actually see the good traffic flow both north and south bound the twenty five ... or giving through town itself of course it's Monday school's starting to build a little bit of traffic on fifty east of the freeway\nHudson droid Norwood usual slowdown spots fifty ...

so the president wrote the U.S will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid\nLives meeting and happiness and so I think it's very important\nTo um as far right as they come on the right versus left to continue but it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for order liberty so that you can go live in the communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build a better mouse trap or apps\nOr where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics is a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left um they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people\nSay enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to Nancy Pelosi and California\nHunter hunting arena where does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and Kentucky exactly\n... because there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have persuasion as any goal\nThe the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing\nThat I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and are there is no anti ... hair and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with\nThinking about anti ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that that basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it\nWas shared content ...\nThere was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two\nThey're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our\nMedia as if the people like ... who are doing this to hope for a viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignored them [noise]\nSo what he is are\nAre we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually comeback to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... or ... I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we\nBelieve in law go day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God\nWith eternal souls and with dignity that's way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people\nAre not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forests\nAnd statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless\nWe can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community and I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about with deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this ah and you're looking over the horizon and we want to talk about that we are talking to Ben\nSasse his new

divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other is an awareness that there's actually a national security exposures for this country and how much we ate each other around politics we need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes

of making people better I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life liberty\nPursuit of happiness and no one talks about that I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness sorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there are there many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal\nI'd hang of it before it surely start let's start with me I should go into education\nAbsolutely on them and talking about getting rid of all standardized testing prior to high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because they're nice testing is it unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy satellites testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go where your book liberties are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and almost I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was the department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about it really do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read write\nSurvive in the world without and at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school districts did a good job somehow that worked out of the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nAnd they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready so nice testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators\nGo away and then it shows while riding granted measures were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one say nice things because I crossed the entire state might say that sixty two counties across all city to\nGet the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers the average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty among\nYou dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve many K through ten the last two years of high school for too many kids is\nJim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this\nBecause the first year of college for most kids is their teeth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college was terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say and wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is when people show up at the clock in the morning so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey gotta has a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally and the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great hospital\nAnd then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that the biology chemistry history or whatever right off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator as life is good\nI don't like that no word on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves Dr teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who them and go back to the gate sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory data okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to the degree why should they be bored in school and they should be one school\nNext you don't want any of those things now where he's going to be a trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber carp and do whatever you want to be about mechanic an H ... guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty\n... that's a problem I let my ... year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in the ocean to doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people imagine if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss lowering it means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learned that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lot of these sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth right I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck\nHis ... his wife ... going to happen\nA bunch of cool prep schools will pop up a bunch of great trade schools will pop up get that much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars going day well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what bank love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will absolute give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven sweaters is more than four billion dollars\nWe said all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nTo allow use of marijuana in any business serving

owners in New York state if not more well how do they need insurance now when\nWhen when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant\nSay fact was passed and twenty Thirteen and the the fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before completely totally above board you are now a violent selling it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes oh the cops who are said to revamp the because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop once you retire when you're a felon again\nBecause you know we're not going to come up this is this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy constantly project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's

the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nAs it\nTurns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this\nHappened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent um but it\nLooks as though he was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went\nRogue ... but it's kind of hard to believe\n[noise] the new information today you know is this coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly or last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead\nUm but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then\nThe Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation torture and killing\nI don't know\nIf they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if the Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it's finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true\nFor her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if as if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh\nThe the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in\nHere or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you'd need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true [noise] this\nMay be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that sets the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire\nBut Saudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia we're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen\nUm we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of more machinery to Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is quietly supportive of of ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel they are also a an ally with us against Iran they are a balance of power\nIf this tape exists and this tape comes out we have all known that\nSaudi Arabia is a bad place but we have not heard the screams\nIf this tape exists and comes out people of the world will for ever think of Saudi Arabia and put them in the same class as Stalin as Hitler as Mabhouh or as Kim Jong moon\nAh in in uh\nNorth Korea but we remember North Korea's crimes we only have sketches of\nIf this tape exists and comes out it's a game changer that could destabilize everything will go back into the\nStory in a second first let me tell you our sponsor is one eight hour one eight hundred flowers dot com the

very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we deal with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure to not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation and you better take this tape seriously\nBecause if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and Tom to everybody down\nAnd then what everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you do you do the tape because that's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not friends of ours they are not friends of ours\nThey are selling us crap that quite honestly I

know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\n[noise] why do it peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little

it's growing in America which is you know what killing the ashes really essentially about\nAnd and a lot of people still want to look away at it they they don't want to engage and um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive the most and art\nIn our society the press sympathizes with all of them they sympathize with open

this um\nUh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties or some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say a a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... march for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nA that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties the press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody\nElse will take a cell phone video and throw it out there just what happened is that an over the weekend is ...\nAnd then he grew up doing that would have to hire security\nThey'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes it takes leadership it takes organization but but on the press thing look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press\nIs actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes solidly still try to do with Trump into basically dismissing\nSaudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad but Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran\nIn the middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism and\nDestruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American laugh wanna destroy\nThat nation when in history we outlawed herself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nPictures and send them to them and they they'll actually look at them and help

calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com basin right\nMore than likely the full three years of the ISIS occupation and muzzle and they were done they wanted to leave they wanted to get out of there because as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS you know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so\nLiving behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolutely health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that day there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of societies that true [noise]\nWe did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there um and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground\nYou know and and it it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWere seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is good they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because you know they look like me they're white guys read ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so\nYeah so you went from that um to are saying I I've got to do I've got to keep doing this ... um and that brought you to Burma mhm right yes and now you're working\nWith an as rain fun yes in Burma yes and last week talked you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update forth yes absolutely so\nAh also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from than as her infant or ... you were telling me that you were trying to organize a mattress people yes and you were going to bring them all together slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago\nAnd met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border and\nThey they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to have the ... okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist looking out all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's really really good thing um\n[noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their eyes are done several trips with the ... fund in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to have us because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the ... army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people\nAlive so why why are they doing this why are they doing this to these\nTribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic Berman to control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject a surf class you have to basically serve the ... and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just as a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because we're there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacked them even more\nTell me what you wrote me so I brought a brought with me several photos\nHave somebody I'm over his mercy its best they're apologizing for getting so I brought with me [noise] several photos of of what I see all the time when I go to these places [noise]\nAnd these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\nOf of one particular um attack that happened um this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you had any photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos you see dead civilians you see\nKids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage is their intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a baby and that's a baby\nIntentionally and killed and the baby didn't die right away I'd survived for about twenty four hours and then died and this just looks like it's in the woods yeah they're out in the jungle these people have nothing and warm army still wants to attack them and take more from them and so every time I go there every time\nThe ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and\nI Can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the artist for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives\nAnd a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the arm army him and his family have fled the Burma Army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the jungle in the middle of nowhere um\nHe he heard that the other end fund was there and he came and found me and he said hey I Want to I Want to I Want to thank you please come to my house for dinner tonight so they gave me on a motorcycle and I drive at this man's house in the middle of nowhere\nWhen I get in there his wife is cooking pigs that for me to eat because that's the big fat and rice and ... and ... and so we're sitting there and he's like hey I I when I was like I Wish I had more to give you a he's like this is all I have for a snack and he pulls out a bag and it's literally tree bark it's bark from a tree\nAnd he's like this is all we have the snack on while my wife prepares food and he gave me\nTree bark to eat and I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this guy and she has nothing is literally nothing\nAnd she wanted to give me a tree bark because that was the best that he had and so I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark but this man\nAnd I I was I was so overcome was just like I\n... his gratitude at the level of gratitude he showed for us for that for the ... being there it was it was unbelievable it was so touching and then later on as I was leaving as I was leaving the jungle another man barely speak any English\nUm he's um I'm On a motorcycle and he's driving me out of the jungle and he ... he as he is driving he turns me he says thank you and I said oh\nLike oh you good English or what I'm trying to paint him and talk more about um um I'm about what what use more English and so I was like oh like what what do you what are you grateful for what do you know yeah and he's like is that this is amazing he said thank you for giving my people hope [laughter]\nSo I had someone else's head I mean is so on display with CNN right now they\nCan't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia Trump Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia he's in trouble you know two or does Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\nHow they can they caught somebody up alive alive they butchered him alive caught him up and\nPut them in a suitcase and you're looking for a way an angle to get\nTrump what is wrong with you people that's wrong with\nThe it was like legitimately like a sickness for some of them I thought if not CNN but I mean it is it as a network\nAs a whole they can't\nFigure out a way to discuss any other topic is really incredible I mean he really does dominate to their lives every aspect or at least there's at least they're public life I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about it all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just looked at the headline at Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally\nAgain like all of these stories like the Elizabeth Warren thing is is interesting 'cause she's gonna be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean a real flop eared what we're talking about when the all time political flops yes she's tried\nShe has to come and get ahead of this or again it is a ... it's an important political story for somebody who is going to run for president yeah\nBut really with Saudi Arabia [noise] going on right now with that and what that possibly means should we take a pause and we'll get some of the stock market anybody know why anybody talking about that why is it now\nCheck out the lens blog got five dining case yes J. dot com back\nWednesday October Seventy one years down the Bree I our radio asked her radio podcast video featuring a brand new episode with the legendary served\nPaul McCartney [laughter] no I'm In ... to all of this film with Joel leaving was talking about his new album Egypt Station then of course some discussion about a little band called the beat off we were when we were playing music radios inside the studio by checking out\nThe ... D be right here [noise]\n\nIn fact Linda [noise]\nLove new program so glad that you are here um we're going on tour here soon and we would love to see you grab your tickets now to Glenn Beck dot com tour were coming to a theater near you it's Richmond Hershey Pittsburgh Cleveland Kansas City uh\nTulsa Tampa Orlando and other cities around you make sure that you grab your tickets or you can do to Glenn Beck dot com slash tour a we're going to see if you\nCan spend as much as a democratic socialist game show that I don't think you can win no no I think we all lose in the end and you know the sad\nPart of the sometimes do Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big win for Republicans really and we're seeing a case of this here it appears in Texas where Beto O'Rourke or Robert Francis or if you know as his parents wanted him to be known\n'em is going by as\nHe used to call themselves going right when it was cool when it when it's beneficial\nTo be called Bobby called himself Bob yeah now he calls himself All right so Beto\nIs running here in Texas and if you don't have a new haven't seen that you haven't been watching\nA any national media as far as not just politics I'm outside of that Ellen and cold there ... you have and hurry where CNN town hall coming up tonight just him um again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base out of thirty eight million dollars\nAnd going to have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like Cruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we noticed could change but\nWell they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK and that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have and I never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the is the margin now with cruise leading\nBy seven points this is from by the way the same company that is hosting the town hall with better tonight CNN at their poll faint you forty five\nI think he wins by twelve and maybe as high as a team\nI mean that would be a real surprise or no it would be but you know that one is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe believe the polls here in Texas you know it'd be great if he won it'd be won by\nThree but I I just think that there is this something that ah you know when you get when you when you get right down to it Texans are going to say yeah I ... I\nTend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean a nine or ten is definitely possible\nInteresting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for governor here in Texas\nIs winning by a much larger margin a usually is or I don't have the one in right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points yeah every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's so much he's up by age Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were Abbott is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll\nIs it the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um ... you'd think a great read country right in Texas mhm however uh the poll\nShows that fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters where it's a forty nine\nForty eight but still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas\nLook at it this way try this on for size or a Donald Trump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we not talking about today and I know in talking about the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "17", "locations": [["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["London",

I think he just he contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff\nMember of the Washington Post columnist wasn't any or he'd written it's relatively new yeah because he left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new\nAnd you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean ... that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize on with that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one with the biggest political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty years ago and he's all outage and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about four they been\nOur allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them\nTo exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way that Brock Obama would have done anything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point now there wouldn't have done anything about this it's a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage\nToday the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker\nWho is tense of right I mean remember good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again\nThe big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before\nHe ... he walked out of the room remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as the bad guy who who's ... who's incompetent\nBrock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years since the Harlem Harlem me there was a decision made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision and in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand and one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was a risk in the mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean it you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options in and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally\nIf for Rocco bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who's a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is our this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nOr potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your own self but something happened there and ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't there are more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still well that'd be age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune his reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nUh actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ... um Saudi Arabia publicly pledged payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into\nOh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars of course\nThere are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] that our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that kind of I mean look at it it's not completely in significant\nTo the relationship right I mean that there was there are these considerations and that is why when you're making a decision as the president of the United states your decision is not solely based\nOn you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day\nAmerican interests are harmed long term\nBy a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your\nTop priority is not a ... murders in Turkey right like\nThe beginning right out of anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore such studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things all over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a\nIf you'd be pissed off of ... yeah they'll call us mass that we're not as we are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called jak you what do you are on the commercial on a jaguar\nWhat it's like they like if you come up with a name on your own\nMaybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced but what is a word\nWe already know and when I say you were a hundred years it stop it we it's an animal yes and they're not just a car it's an animal to right every citizen jak you are [laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that the I think that's jak you are\nTrying to seem refined right\nLike this like um there's something nothing a little snooty about the way they pronounce ... er jaguars like at the stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog\nAnd then this Yankee water [laughter] would you be gone [laughter] exactly where they're ripping up by a bitter and into my dog is terrible I but luckily I felt with my bones on top of it so everything's gonna be okay [laughter]\nThat happens is you know ... three times last week alone for me and it was

you know do you have some very modest [laughter] so we'll see how that turns out we'll give you the updates when we get them or we need to warn you about\nSomething that's incredibly dangerous in our society and all too prevalent in that's a Disney Princess is um we're being worn by ah some Hollywood actresses that there is some danger there Karen nightly\nIs promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the four realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values ... so she is forbidden her three year old daughter ... from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is\nA been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her and she says don't rescue yourself obviously\nAnd this is the one I'm but she ... she's mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and there's not really as a self yes she didn't pull herself out of that situation she's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man\nOr a man yeah thank you mhm there's a lot of women are doing that today\nThe main message ... or ... of really the entire movie is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them to rescue a especially a rash of rich guy that's\nThe message you should be taking from those movies I'm Christian bell is also fearful that Disney princes are sending the wrong message to her children she's actually the voice of the Disney Princess uh Anna and frozen wasn't that done by Christian Bale yes [laughter]\nSo she tells her daughter's Lincoln and delta that ah when she ... when she read Snow White del taco bell\nYes and Lincoln bell yes and when she read Snow White two inch closes up the book and she says every time we close no white I looked at my girls and ask don't you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple\nI say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no\nI'm like okay I'm doing something right yeah you've proved it\nA while you nailed that one there did wrist and then she'll also say and\nGirls don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission\nWell no because she's in a coma mom [laughter] can't camera permission and she'll stay in a column I ... doesn't cancer\nRight I mean she's advocating for the government could continue right the gangs are out of it\nRight and bell says uh because you can't kiss someone if they're sleeping\nOn how does that mean in my circumstances that's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book right the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's\nA magical apple\nThere's a a a print or with a magical spell right on the princess yes and she's sleeping because she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's kind of the premise\nThat yeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that part of your lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird I even get yourself still worked up about the you know what I Hope happens every day it every day when she brings breakfast to them they ask her where did this\n[laughter]\nThey just torture her with the rest of her life [laughter] 'cause I can understand this you know sometimes I think even\nYou know ... like conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things are like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon because we're watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it's like I Know it was a captain planet or whatever and all of that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about

version of Sleeping Beauty the\nKing sneaks into sleeping beauties castle and raped her\nAnd she wakes up pregnant what yeah way what do you mean this isn't a this is amazing the original like story or the original\nStory from an Italian guy Jim ... to ... ... uh that was his original story now they took a lot of his original stories\nI'm Charles Peralta in the late seventeenth century and then the brothers Graham in the Eighteen hundreds took those stories reworked him change them a little bit but the original was like\nReally horrible when you say there he worked in the dark out on on the amounts of\nRape yeah was that was that one of the thing is that the actual assault was something they decided you know what maybe for a children's book we don't include that slightly what if we go back to ... percent yeah I Would do something like that something he'd be open to a like a hundred or a hundred percent on the\nCut back of yeah uh 'cause that's pretty amazing pretty amazing so\nEven these tainted version that we see today those are still offensive and horrible and you can't let your\nKids see him I guess um yeah it's amazing\nYeah it's it's amazing it's interesting what we what we the the way these standards change which isn't it there's a new report on Lucy K uh out today maybe with the end of that later on today or because it's interesting the standards that are being

Thirteen\nYou know play the Glenn Beck blog\nHas pretty much why I said I thought\nTo the news radio to ... ... my Tom pale and President Trump will meet today to talk about ... and Saudi Arabia and turkey about the disappearance of a Washington\nPost columnist President Trump says he's looking forward to a long talk this morning with secretary of state Mike ... just back overnight from turkey and Saudi Arabia\nI Want to find out what happened where is this fall and we will probably know that by the end of the ... neither the president I'm not sure yet that it exists probably does\nNor Palmdale we'll talk about what's reportedly of gruesome audiotape or the killing of Washington Post journalist your mark ... inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey\nSystem and when you try to go around that and you try to say well we know better than the police we know better than the investigators because I don't know it really looks bad or ah I don't know it really looks like a this was this happened\nThat that that's a terrible direction to go and lead you don't all full roads where you're trying to judge things that you can't possibly judge correctly\nYeah and it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this progress as a in a year or two or five for now with Brett Kavanaugh because there was nothing to back up\nOr his accusers claims there was no corroboration there was no evidence at all of these allegations from thirty five plus years ago\nAnd yet uh\nI just saw an article today above from ... Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice ...\nAre just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no ... and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time in the ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't care you occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know the debate still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest paid per capita\nBut I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the ... the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning the Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we don't know um\nBut the other people and Cory Booker do not care won't for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so you could call themselves Spartacus or and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and yeah and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nAnd again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but what are you judging by the standards that they're putting up\nIt's totally different ... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating\nAfter I think of how recent is Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... that story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find that Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what happened what mine of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named\nInstead came out and yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on or something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident but just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party occurred none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against or\nFive people said ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred wow so now while for one person who is at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nUh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn panty hose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days with the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape and that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Camelot and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison over there are so work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended newspaper reports suggest that Clinton was\nIn the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel window wow that is a thousand times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats and now yeah you'll see\nOccasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after\nThey never want to hear about either one of their uh stories ever get to them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them but I mean Bill Clinton goes on is still makes a\nBig level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre and the fact that they that the media\nActually thinks we should take their current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when you report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system with\nActual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened I mean that is what that the system we have is the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we are now supposed to go through these kinds of records and an even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it is now or standard that can sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is some actual evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's tried to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated a reception\nOf Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy as they are so pissed off about that and they don't want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then Michael up and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad they'd even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other night I took on Hillary Clinton and you know to

I'm ... with traffic [noise]\nYou're listening to Glenda program with patents do triple eight Seventy Seventy easy Kay [noise] uh there's this\nThere's an interesting thing for the New York times today and it is they do this little\nPod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm well you did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah none of them they said yes that are part of this dug up with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something\nThat against motives will write like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where\nUm he [noise]\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure in himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics hour to an absolutely yeah the power to make it makes you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he's in ... he wields incredible power right in this country now incredibly led to have her\nFired at any job in the nation and giving any job you're a sarcasm is just reality and the situation I got to go away it only what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them people were other comedians\nAnd one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there or something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was because this is his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a\nWife or the child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're\nRight I have issues and that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation\nHe asked her to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I I have issues I'm Sorry\nBut that is is that sexual assault what I mean the accusation there are no amateur watched what she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right and he admitted in such a\nGeneral way that people kind of a make eating people he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make the make them right and I think that that\nWould I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no\nAnd and they and the idea that you\nKnow Lucy K because he's a famous uh\nComedian can affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nThat he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again he's making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the focus scares away from right you're not supposed to just as the other and people will commit crimes in the future\nSo down and listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedians I never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks into does the ... or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while because that are loose the gay woman and it doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's bounced around to several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times there's an exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner about why you\nLet him on stage this is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision\nWas some other people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy and he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like\nNever mhm might never says never\nWell can you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence and never work again he says I don't care never misses an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a place where you would say particularly to a female customer who is somebody that's on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton\nThe idea that this is a right wing phenomenon I mean it just seems like people who are on the right pay the price for it where people on the left you know don't necessarily see that the same way and you know I think you have to get to a point\nWhere someone like Lucy K who was I think are accused could correctly of being a dirt bag right who was in it to his own admission but\nNot not any nothing that was over this line of sexual assault at least it's\nNot as reported you know you have to look at these\nThings as they said I mean these are is now doing shows again um and he was a he was accused of something um you know what's his face from the New York times he's back\nOr the Glen or what the heck is his name you know to get it wrong thrush right used of uh of harassing a young interns and other underlings and he he's back at work\nWe have this weird saying why I mean Mike Tyson\nIt's pretty clear the man was convicted of rape not not accurate time convicted of rape spent time in prison yeah and he's like the darling of the media he comes out of you guys it's silly appearances we have a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he's I mean and look he served time and he's out right now\nUm and so you can make the case as the left has made forever that people who go in felons you'll be able to come back and vote you should be we their programs to give felons in convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accuse if he is yeah it really doesn't make any sense AAA seven twenty seven back is\nThe phone number or it is a pat and sue for Glenn who\nUh is traverse ing currently or the Mediterranean Sea in a canoe or he's always wanted to do it and he finally said you know what this is a week so

it\nWell do you how did he lie what do you lie about it he said he drink to excess from time to time yep\nWhat are you lie about the idea is that we're all other because other people around and we're like well I think he ... people did blackout how the hell the you know you're not only he would know that right uh you know and maybe he did I I don't see how that all that ah\nThere's no way to know that and to the conversation but still there's no way to know what if the ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the subtle\nAccusation that everyone who supported Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person\nEven from people like you know there are people in the left but you know I'm sure a restaurant I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is\nThey accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want them on the Supreme Court\nRight and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her your prerogative but you don't accuse me of a bowl of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened yeah\nI don't either and it hadn't been I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe believing that is so is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't fair but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official\nOr in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades then talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who\nWere there and they can't remember the party like what are we and the person who's making the accusation has an overt uh dislike for\nThe party of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is march women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like you have to take in motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea basically I think people almost like it's going to sound bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor the indicate that this this has occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would I ever called the victim I called them survivor but then I wouldn't they Levi\n... survived this assault by this man if they've assault didn't happen they didn't survive it and [laughter] you know I guess we could all call herself survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so far life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... million things are possible you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one mhm possibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nNot whether they should like this I don't know when I taught at school we talk\nAbout uh yeah I Know we talk about\nThe the women's right to choose it is just fainted as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one I wouldn't defend my children's lives\nAs strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children\nHit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans the idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right\nThat you think is so vital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five five accusers accused of high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay this happens all the time you know why\nPeople are horrible\nMany of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things\nThat you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing a swastika on their door for nothing you can like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused we can they do we know\nFor a fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them we know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or when it happened we know that the third accuser which I'm Michael ... and no\nOne including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first two\nAnd in the second one is the is that there's a ... they're right when they the person who made the allegation\nSaid I I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen\nAnd she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly\nThat's the old act on Sunday ... operating what evidence on that one either and they're ... and look the Fort one was only I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people they're just with no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In and of course obviously people a cabin on his uh his or what this is worth saying no um but\nThat one was serious because she went in to you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing relatively credible\nJob it recounting what she believed the story was who knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the like\nState who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's just completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you can do it I mean that as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said they were they vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this like the media access if this is entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter]\nI Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd you you brought up to high school situation in California where they call it the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault\nOr and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk I don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him the credits didn't like him to really encourage\nI cannot hold up I wouldn't think so but the the the community as a plotting the police swift success the swift excessive locating interesting him\nIs due to the timely information provided by numerous concern teens and adults as well as the cooperation of the park ridge police department and the cook county sheriff's bleak ... is this what was he was a a multi\nDepartment good uh operation and she'd get this kid we did this story come around no do we here at the end but by the way they found out it was an air soft gun and now he's you know this story you know ...\nCause I mean it let's just say you had a realistic looking air soft gun ... that media lost it a little are you I assume they all have the orange thing on the end yes just bakery no let's just say that fell off or something or you can eat it at blackberry what'd you say\nHe's walking down the street or he's walking towards the school I can understand someone passing by me like a what the hell's going on and sharing the police yeah and what happens if they show up\nAnd they talk to them they owe generic ... I think are the orange piece of people are gonna freak out and then you release them right let's say a max the maximum penalty but we will look we're going to take the gun will return it to you later\nInstead they found the ... gun in his truck and arrested him for disturbing the Peace Did they realize it was an air so yeah they knew it was in ... they said it was an air soft gun and they're they're still\nBeing congratulated for their sweet success [laughter] oh man that I don't know\nI don't know what are you going to do with an ... I mean if you shot somebody in the eyes yeah you're supposed to work out those right when you're wearing yeah that would hurt ha ha ha you might put an eye out my mom warns me more than me about that a word that was a kid\nUm but other than that\nI I don't know what you're going to do with yourself gun that's so dangerous that they had their arrest the kid when they found out it's an air so I've gotten\nBut he wasn't even walking down the street he posted a photo you didn't on right now buddy\nDidn't didn't say I'm going to use this at school and none of that\nVery bizarre Mm\nCheck out the lens blog five Ninety case yes J. dot com and keyboard banging\nOn the next episode of death ride global pod cast with Arianna Huffington she discusses our beliefs are influenced by the power of storytelling Howard touched by news and white creating boundaries is crucial for six that\nDr Wilbur pod cast is brought to you by sleep number this leak number ... on each side is perfect for both you and your partner experienced the sweet number bang exclusively at one of their five hundred and fifty stores nationwide\nChecked him out its number dot com slash dry\nFall pick that perfect Halloween costume by your candy weren't\nPerfect soundtrack to help you with all those activities we\nRadio and I are radio\nWe've all seen that moment in movie credits that says no animals were harmed and then they can still\nComes and goes pretty quickly so much goes into making sure that happened [noise] film director I rely on the eight decades have experienced American Humane brings to safeguarding [noise]\nWork starts well before we ever sell to consult scripts advise patients\nProvide guidance on training veterinary care workplace safety and much more [noise]\nCan mean upset making sure we get rain\nToday their mission is more important than ever\nBecause when you were director of making movies\nShow a Web series music video or commercial\nDang passionate people as Americans\nAnd\nIt's the worst they made a ...

that case yes J. and Sundays a tip so it's a just enjoy is if you happen to be out on Saturday Sunday Morning we'd love to have you uh\nMake an appointment with us and we're here every weekend one of the fact Montgomery in steward funeral directors for underwriting our show along with visiting angel we appreciate the great support to the community\nAnd the many years of a service of both companies so so thank you for that a special guest ... and really right up my alley lease Augustus and is a is as a coach and she helps you through a ... D printer source\nTo discover what it is that amber the burn\nFor something to do that's unique to what your gift to do that takes your experience\nThat takes ... you know the resource of time which is much more valuable to the resource of money but the resource of time and helps us to point towards accomplishing something that really resonates in our in our lives ... did I say that right Lisa\nAbsolutely it's about nurturing that that dream those possibilities options of being self sufficient of being financially independent nurturing that dream of being your own boss and doing their own thing\nThough we talked about being your own boss so let's let's go to ... so that we can broaden people's understanding of what's really out there I mean the guy is the limit\nIn in terms of franchising there are hundreds of them in many different sectors some of which you got to buy a big building for some of them you've got to serve food in but many of them you can do from your own home\nAbsolutely you know there's thirty eight different models as we discussed earlier right and only eight to nine percent of them are ... are fast food but we think of that 'cause when we're driving around that's the only see\nBut you know there's a lot of different models out there and I love what you talked about earlier when you when you think of what a franchise is a business model and that includes things like licenses and distributors ships um you know it's basically what I call a system\nAnd if you think of the acronym s y S T e M save yourself significant time energy and money and that's one of the reasons why\nI Love this business is because people who want to take control their destiny can ramp up fast\nThey can really go quicker because a business model has already been established ... audited over overtime tweaked in and brought up\nUm and there's just so many different things out there for people to look at and\nAs well said I mean it is a team sport and I've told so many people they said well I Want to do this business but I'm going to do it on my own yeah um and it takes sometimes three four times longer to do it yourself it it does to\nTo to get in capitalize it get a team working with you and take off fast and and that three or four years of time you used to grow something as you could do it in half the time you take a look at the resources that you pick up\nAnd the momentum that you've gained so ... is a great way to fix or to interrupt\nYou know absolutely and you know doing start up completely from the ground up there are people out there that can do it and they're very successful at\nIt this is just a different model for me it's about efficiency I have a I have a girlfriend that she can she can create a financial platform or marketing platform and operational platform you know an HR platform\nI mean she can do all that from the ground up and you know ... you know hats off to her um but for me I'm like I\nTalk to him about a financial system oh my goodness no way I mean so so for me having these platforms and having them tweaked in audited and already that's what really that's what really is good and you know basically when you look at franchises people think that they have to have the technical skills Dave\nBut you were and visiting angels where were you a gerontology\nAir force officer and I'd never even been to a hospital and they were you a pilot\nYeah well I did television shows for the year I'm going to fly but but you know what the system helps you to learn those skills\nAbsolutely and that's what people think they think that you have to have the technical skills but most of the time there's only two skills you really need\nTo have success in a business model and to run it well and that is managing operations and following a system and that's because you know you're not always in the business you can be working on the business\nBut you know the really neat thing about it is that the clients that we work with and you know this is the meat thing there is no cost to work for me or work with me no cost whatsoever there's no rest there's no obligation\nI get to work with people all the time he just want to go on a journey of discovery to look at business ownership and is it is that right for them is it the vehicle for them to get those possibilities options and dreams\nBut Ninety five percent of the clients we work with go on to in a business that they wouldn't have considered on their own war had looked at him prematurely dismissed\nAnd part of that is because they don't know everything out is out there and part of it is because we back into it we look at\nWhat are the things you want in income lifestyle wealth in equity we don't want you to buy a job yeah we want you to have the benefits that you want\nSo that's good I I think that you know this discovery process in everybody's life is the light bulb comes on and you're sitting here saying you're willing to do this for free\nAbsolutely and you know and it's a dream job gave I mean you love it to you always knew of always talk to me about the the CEO of your life go make things happen just print up sim cards and that's when I get to do all day I get to say hey let's get some clarity around it and you know what if you find out that this isn't the right vehicle for you\nThat's wonderful to because you've

briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts\nAnd it was all about do you think that maybe the president shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they vote horrible you think the president maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report\nHe was skating facts that were given during Dr forts testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts and whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart

hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody he did it privately\nSomebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and are we going to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever among glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back yet\nTo be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them\nWere coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while the other like a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number I Can't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me to\nGet away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant capturing the Kennan this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been taught\nAnd heard on the news and talking to her but she may literally believe that memory I have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nOr else will rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um [noise] um you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the one hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine you\nKnow the look on the phone up at it right by the way here's this ... you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include all women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I

Kavanaugh was sworn in this evening after being burned by the Senate President Trump claiming victory tonight at a political rally in Topeka, Kansas he will\nThe charges are upsetting a and and uh they're obviously they triggered him entire a national conversation about sexual assault and sexual harassment about the unequal way or the women and girls are printed in this country at the same time there is as of now no contemporaneous corroborating evidence\nFor any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say yes I remember that and that is an important part of the story as well\nThat is not just an important part of the story that is the story that is the story and I for one\nI for one we'll not condemn Ford and I will not condemn a a Brett Kavanaugh I wasn't there I'm not God there is no evidence they need to vote to confirm and we need to stop the witch hunts [noise]\nNeither listening to blend that probably am so [noise]\nIn my village addicted outrage um there are lots of examples of\nOf why we should really be talking about something entirely different why\nWe should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this and spread this around the world\nRight now are dialogue is America's sucks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely\nNot true in the middle chapter of the the book I I ask this question\nIs this worth saving\nNobody is asking this we're talking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking the question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both but is it\nOn the on the whole has it helped more people or hurt more people\nNot having that conversation we are having it now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the city\nThat'll area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think\nIt's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a that fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we'd never seen anything like that\nThat was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good viewing months how're you doing\nI'm I'm I Am great I'm great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not to talk about\nWhat capitalism are and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window and you make compelling case because you didn't commit this with politics in mind\n[noise] no I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we're talking about today I was maybe the last segment of your great show\nAnd and you you're talking about this big war this big cultural battle that we're having in those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about\nThe Trump Administration or about capitalism in general these are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nUm you've done humans work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we are so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean it it's going to ... if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying the most violent ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knocking the night there's going to be no jak booted thug nobody's going to take after prison God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars that's completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I ... you know the big ideas are being trash the ideas of freedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense yeah\nBut also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopians it bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives of most of my [noise]\nMy my left wing friends and family that I care about poverty in ...\nAnd I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us clan believes\nAnd their their obligation infect their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works while you sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system it pulled people up to billions all around the world\nThese are big issues that we need to be talking about in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you I don't know if you have him off the top of your\nDo I'll absolutely so some Nineteen Seventy\nUntil today you know when when you and I were really little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on there was really in the seventies that people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three is starving children it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until today eighty percent of the world's poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been eradicate no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nLike front page and the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not a news story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is it two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of starvation poverty Glenn since you and our kids and there was one thing that\nDid that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me or through um that we are not using the first half of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter you know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it as\nAdam Smith lines out it it can produce really bad things as well yeah capitalism depends on the people who are willing ... are wielding it but also uh depends on on what our goals are yeah slow and it's got up to now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of all we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington D. C. and in every state Capitol around the country\nThat's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people so so competition is good competition politics and economics and then the competition of ideas fact is that\nYou know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a free and democratic nation is very very important anybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people is not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy and doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas\nTo compete means to do it better than the other guy fairly peacefully and respectfully and to win over an audience and that that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nOkay so Arthur I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back with the question I cannot find a satisfactory answer on I Am a big believer in capitalism however\nThere is a throughout history some people like Vanderbilt et cetera et cetera they get so much money they have so much power that they are controlling things and it it just seems to spiral out of control when you have\nYou know a just a lock on this wealth and we are creating people through Google et cetera et cetera that are doing the same thing how do you balance the power how do you how do you make sure who's who can compete against Google\nHow are you going to do that how does that work when you get to that point to that like to hear your answer on that when we come back [noise]\nClans\nWeekdays at five thirty Easter join us for a brand new program where were fired up about the time ever wonder why the stories that we use these days I Want to hear we\nWant to see how that important for why we discussed the things the mainstream media won't touch it was like it's your lucky day you're like me and the guy for our yourself then yes and why it matters\nYou wanted more so you've got the news and why it matters weekday five thirty only in the blaze TV [noise]\nThose news talk on line and five Ninety KCBS Jay ... I'm\nLast summer when bitcoin was down forty percent and trading was about two thousand dollars are going to get to Laurie from the Palm Beach let her go to expert on everything crypto wrote that bitcoin would hit ten thousand dollars by the end of the year people thought he was nuts we were in the middle of a horrific a bear market but it was right it hit\nAnd they accumulate this power and then with all of that money comes corruption and they start to control everybody else's lives and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you\nHow do you reconcile that because I don't want to take money away from people\nRight now I got a glass and you know it is distressing when you see something like a family where there was a patriarch it was a good entrepreneur but then kind of built\nIn ... around the castle and that\nKept a bunch of wealth and the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise through current capitalism that's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system that's a those basically ... system over wire deals you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism more or whatever ... whatever isn't whatever economic system that we've got we have to democratize opportunity the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be putting our resources and our energy in our law and our initiative toward\nPeople that are at the bottom non so they can all get to the top but so that they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience them the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like stretching out potatoes\nSome ways they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country I wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors for system that make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies you know if you went to university three four five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience so so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't rise today that's that's really an American thing\nAnd why can't they rise that can't rise because we have a discriminatory system unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education systems their parents don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college where people actually homework skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did The Apprentice system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen on until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America where white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nAnd and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater white kids black kids every kind of kids should have the opportunity to succeed through hard work and skills and personal initiative without going to college\nAmazing or that it's it's that early I think of apprenticeships and I think you know you're going back to\nCharles Dickens times since we've seen it it's amazing that those that really disappeared in the sixties and seventies\nBack with more Arthur Brooks and is America worth saving that Mm\nMan you check out the lens blog advice dining case yes J. dot com keyboard and back

two thousand and it was all but it's been nominees and so but it was common sense yeah yeah it's been a long time so I joined this is lots of fun joined us grab your tickets now Glenn\nBeck dot com slash to her okay back with a Arthur C Brooks\nHe's the president of the American Enterprise Institute Arthur though the ... who is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics it was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it\nUm on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human beings like this is this is not good none of this is good\nUm yeah however ... we're not having\nAny one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has gone awry because we've ... you know unpaid from that capitalism\nIs is got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden isn't\nIt isn't and and by the way there are some people standing up for the bill arrives in the constitution guys like Glenn Beck and when you got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and true in good\nThe big problem as there are too many people in media and politics and entertainment and on college campuses on the right and the left or ... or ... dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other I mean Glen you and I we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically\nThat's fine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and and people that we love we just have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have\nTo hate it when there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful\nBy trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talked about the things that really bring us together and then try to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich\nBy by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I say capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nYeah I Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time their way not to take that on is by trying to create liberal tears that's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive and to say their belief system is stupid\nThat will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because he is your brothers and sisters as well the key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective the moral objection to the people is to is to give voice to the fact that\nYou you want these up social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy\nAnd free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history\nIt's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody has ever thought of in the history of humanity and say and now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives um sold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you described\nAs leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program or you

not willing to fight\nDonald Trump allowed this to happen and Kavanaugh would have been completely discredited I think under any other president he would have just gone away discredited because they would have said you know what it's not worth it we don't believe those charges and he would have had no platform to defend themselves mhm\nDonald Trump is there one thing to say about him he is a fighter he does not give up and uh you know sometimes that's good sometimes that's bad it was very good\nBecause I Can't think of any other president in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan that\nWould have stood for this and would have stood against it\nKnow I Know I the heat surprises me a on a pretty regular basis and I guess I should be used to it by now but uh\nUm you know that's why that's why people voted for him yeah for for this very reason he's willing to ... he's willing to stand and make this fight because he believes in it\nAnd it's ... it's just nothing I really didn't think he had it in it yeah you know we've talked about it before\nYou've got to admit when you're wrong and here's another case of me being wrong and I I Will tell you I think this guy is such a solid citizen at

the insanity that has overtaken the left no I'm Out in evidence in favor of Kavanaugh will change your mind\nAnd you know what I I I really\nI can understand how you might emotionally connect with her

yourself anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check yep no I'm not God today might be your turn unless your God you don't know that you cannot know that I mean this is one of those\nCases where it is so crystal clear to me\nJudge less you be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you if he did it he's out\nIf he was perjuring themselves I don't want a guy on the Supreme Court was perjuring themselves but that requires evidence that requires\nSome sort of of case to be made not accusations\nBut a case to be made\nHere just drawing a person's life so you here's the problem with this particular professor at Georgetown\nShe's looking for social justice\nShe's looking for wrongs to be a to B rice it somehow or another and it doesn't matter all men are guilty all men are guilty well I'm Sorry was gone to be guilty was ... he guilty\nReally\n'cause he was a man was Martin Luther king was he guilty\nYou know the both of those men were flawed both of those men had things about them that I don't like both of those men or they had one was the alleged full land or\nThe other was a clear racist gundy I still think they were great men there were just flawed\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collective justice that I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively evil\nBecause of all of the wrongs that men have done in the past they are collectively evil\nYou go mad\nAnd I am warning and begging people to calmly and rationally explain this to their neighbors\nWhen you go down that road you always always\nUp killing people\n\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole\nBut today if you don't think we're on the edge of a civil war of people like her saying we should feed their genitals to the pigs tell me the difference\nBetween that and Nazi Germany rate rhetoric and what a surprise once again it's coming from the elites in the universities\nIn\nBrooklyn that program\nIt's really hard really very very hard to [noise]\nTo remain [noise]\nReasonable [noise] when the world is unreasonable\nWe must because no one will listen to any message if we are just hurling insults\nIf we are fighting fire with fire it will change no one's mind if you don't believe me how many minds did we change\nDid we change the course of two thousand ten and I I Want you to know\nI don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press tried to convince everyone we were these evil monster is saying X Y and Z and demanding violence so I understand that\nBut because of that which we don't necessarily have this time the media has changed\nIt's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right so\nWhat's the best way to get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them it's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you\nBecause I was so convinced I was right\n\nThat I did that you are you instead I didn't listen to you I just thought you were crazy these are the your your flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw sings a different way and as I've said on many occasions on this program since the election I was wrong on multiple occasions\nBut what\nAmazes me is when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it that's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's foolish\nYou do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others\nAs flake or Collins or Murkowski or Heller okay they just don't believe in and the Republicans dropped the ball they have NO PLAN\nAnd they just like well you know and where do you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do they lose\nThe house and possibly the Senate worst case scenario if they don't get they don't get them through down because the Republicans ... and because of this week with Jeff Flake\nPeople are just like okay the Republicans are worthless I mean and they don't come out with a huge play yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if it's the Republicans that cause it I don't know that kind of where I don't think it'll work okay\nMother scenario he is confirmed the house impeached is Trump the house or impeach his Kavanaugh on perjury [laughter] think that is\nIf they win the house you know they're gonna at least attempt to they will attempt Trump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and\nThe Senate these\nThings are happening and they're well there's no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital\nAnd Trump OK mhm the only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote the only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote\nWhich could be really bad because it will be the Republicans that do it um however Donald Trump comes out and while he says yeah that's over here's the guy he ups the ante and\nYou get a guy that all conservatives are rabbit about\nGuy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with him but no I was willing to die in a sword for memory might remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he asked them later I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next the nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you\nKnow that that's the thing to do because then you have them battling just on abortion right there at the same place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt conservatives getting to the\nPolls if if you\nPut a staunch conservative somebody who says yeah I think abortion is wrong and if it comes before me I'll look at the case of course but I think it's wrong I think it's murder\nAnd that and burgers this way it was a terrible decision you then have\nRepublicans running to the polls and you'll also have Democrats but I think that's your best case scenario gets Laker Collins ...\nCome on\nGiving Web ... news talk on the go a diehard radio and five Ninety KCBS Jane dot com and\nHe\n... [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] Mm Mm Mm [noise] ...\nAt the Glenn ... All right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Kevin uh which ... I'm\nSo we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned Oh yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapists\nAh think you've you know it's up in the area important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or ah or I'm a\nAttorney general general attorney general and ready to go one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's just a certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... there's a separation between the cabinet case in the house in case\nOf the cabinet case happens or thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay\nAll right so there's a difference but that's the one difference ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory yeah she did a very spotty\nMemory and now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between ... and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse or ... violin okay oh okay\nThat really got both of those little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay and so does what did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course well yeah well in their words case\nThey both have a notes from there do they do around those cases out in the ... the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now or never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from uh the uh Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries huh um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction\nBetween those two things one has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll using\nMeeting me yeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident numb and has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening the people Ford named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way a key that was in a girlfriend has also\nA named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm writing um\nPictures and those are things that she showed two co workers\nIn real time in\nReal time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a I've said the name Kavanaugh even at that time but by the ... and I mean you\nI mean you don't have\nVideotape well it was you got the tape now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some uh uh one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't\nBe the thing that we have to take her work\nThat there is video with the\nWith ... with a friend and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we have them out more we have a

of my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line\nAnd that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is that actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go\nAnd the the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it he said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe ... he's a ... I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... or and and he sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people or you know Google's monitor has always been there more than just a company to make money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did in which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about paying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy is not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's continue tied this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how for instance you know there's there's\nUm a\nThere is this overwhelming uh\nUnderstanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen\nThat right yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results of the people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing that\nIn favor of Donald Trump and ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and he ... you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming\nThe results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is Google is a verb but now I'm not a noun verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed\nRight that's like going to a dictionary that will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's real problem no you're\nYou're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because it's occurring right real time but\nThe bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this so it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about as far as\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineer's saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is a thing in Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way of fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus and\nAnd and Hillary arm wrestling probably not going to convince you devote a different way that wasn't that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because the confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why will you know I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent\nYes and it's not very good

to come right up to that creepy line ... terrified veer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I Want it I Want to talk to you about the platform me\nI Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice let's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform\nBecause I Believe these companies\nAre are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing going here yeah I I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first to consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine\nGoogle actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning\nThey blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the the scope and the size that Google ... wait a minute how it is it's it's the ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous and a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but here's your company ... you know it may be John Smith an acme incorporated dot com but\nHis acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example\nRobert up sign this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech on gender or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves they view themselves as a company with a mission\nSo here's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually you are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nLike there's that this is just the beginning let me tell ya boogie story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay this center is the main city of Beijing how many people it used to look it up for me well you're still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle\nThere is so much monitoring

[noise]\nPackages number age at nine nine Dave Anthony Fox News found this morning police in Delaware just intercepted one mailed it for a vice president Biden looking very slow it all the other ones are the Democrats another turned up at five AM in New York City\nNone of them have gone off and you took the time to print a medium that has the ISIS flag and underneath it\nIt's a quote from Larry the cable guy that says get her\nDone except none of your bombs get it done none\nThey they've had zero chance of making it through security screening\nAnd Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point the coyotes got to go this dam road runner keeps go getting away\nMaybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and do you think George Soros does every person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening these devices were not designed to kill\nBut to be detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one\nNow I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left I don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms\nNo one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would be funny again there's no chance these bombs would go off so maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who saw screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other this however\nIs not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste\nBy noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's a wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rent\nRick that pushes his supporters in that direction you know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a\nLeft wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nCould I ask when the president has actually called for violence now you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\n\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business and Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I could go on\nBut we all know the left narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends in the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would force one\nTo deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapist to bring this memory back at it so long ago\n\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple of weeks ago the rice and letters just sent to the\nWhite House James Mattis FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson did you just happen\nTo forget all about all of those or should I take you back to the baseball diamond which was way but I mean how old\nWere you in twenty Seventeen he barely remember was I walking at that time I don't even know\nAnd as far as the identity of Wylie coyote\nFor those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate if you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on anything everything is speculation and if I Would say already ... versus all left wing person dried Iran for everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters and\nBlaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts you do something like that\nAnd something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\n\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny called credibility\nBut you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility to be able to gain it\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us it is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat these Jason how ridiculous is this bomb\nThe most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of when I when we first looked at it I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder\nAnd um I I was looking at it and I was like no not really\nI mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the\nShrapnel was what's dangerous than a pipe bomb the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need\n[laughter] [laughter] right [noise] um\nBut there's another ingredient that they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it um that they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nA lower or somebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work right\nIt had no I mean if you're looking at this thing there is you know and I've also spent some time in some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to\nThey have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN on media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no well I was no chance just gets to\nThe coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a level of sophistication levels sophistication\nBecause he had vent or or she by the way he or she had a had sent 'em some of these bombs to home offices and and read that in\n... where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely\nBe school until I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and her fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from a [laughter] get the paper and the mail every day when she gets\nUp whose home do they go to that they did have a Scranton ... both of them have private security course or sort service at their home right\nThey get older male you you have private security you don't get your don't like we never opened our mailbox I remember one time my kids went to open the mailbox I said do not open the mailbox don't open the mailbox scary\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there are words matter does far they have shown no comprehension of that that is that I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't know like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence\nNo evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fit into these bombings we have no idea\nHave no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there's a political motive but that's a ...\nA political motive but that's all you could say you don't know it is such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who was mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off yeah the sticker the ISIS me right either done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right\nWhy would you\nPut that on there and why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope glad I'm Glad none of them went off by the way um but it it seems to indicate someone who one of these things to be seen every single part of this that we've just talked about\nA no leads to that and and your in your in your point about the timer before it's like ... there's a reason why there's FedEx and da da da da Silva says not an\nExact science and you can't they often to point to our right or

I don't know\nI mean you have to have some level of skepticism of the of the of the of the obvious narrative here right a which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you leap to that is it's not they haven't exploded\nRight so if you are trying to harm someone usually you to be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing ... figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think if someone who was opposed to them but would take a ... minute here and consider that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figure look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be right then and just white powder\nWhy did someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened to a hundred times unbelievably when someone just listen to this I suppose he thinks the\nCommunist didn't set fire to the rice dog as well [laughter] I mean of course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point but you see these statement that have come out from CNN\nAnd ... you know people just outwardly blaming\nThe rights and Donald Trump for this\nLook I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George sources how well no but I think of ... [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're gonna ... you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America you will that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical lie\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or playing golf or tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor may be all you need\nTo lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to\nGo to relieve factor dot com [noise] joined a\nReturn every Saturday and eight thirty for the senior living today show show about ... years for seniors and he'll come topics relating to hell\nIndependent and overall wellbeing of seniors right here in southern Colorado\nIn your living today's visiting and other senior living today show with David ...

on her for some of those\nAre things that she said which is kinda fascinating because that'd be the I mean as we know that they're going to tell us talk to us constantly about the inequality between the sexes and and and how how those conservatives are really about Roy Moore oh he's a he's a bad guy\nOr but we're going to find that when it comes to people like Matt Lauer and Brokaw and how many more\nAt NBC it's been one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to the New Yorker\nI I you know all of that goes on and maybe Kelly happens to be one of the biggest critics of what happened at NBC and yet you know she has one comment that people don't like and she's

know it hasn't sort of there's something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimes stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe's had to work to exercise himself in crime stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ISIS heavier than water\nAnd trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the tell a screen\nSwap tell a screen swap tell a screen\nWith what Twitter and here we are in reality let me read that one more time if you said something unexpected if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you through the tell a screen\nI don't want to ruin Nineteen eighty four for you but let me just say it's not the kind of world we want to end up in unfortunately not enough people read anymore you should because it is exactly the world we're creating\n[noise]\nAll right I

they're white characters were in blackface\nK now their motivation as liberals right\nTheir motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface but they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a a liberal icon of our program\nOK totally okay for them to do it but\nFor her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember\nI don't remember a lot of an outcry from the left over it's always sunny and Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they they have a situation where they all wake up what after like getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live as black people for the day and they walk around ten minutes\nOrderly amazing but beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the you know then the animation but it's still the same types of things happen\nBecause they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is that he he's that they're not trying to be racist or not starting Chinese say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good but the child for example who think they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nAnd the only time they mix right you want to be black and white they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well and you think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true we may say\nAs a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to adjust some things but okay but the issue is her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation not motivated by racism and therefore shouldn't be treated the same way as she loses her gig over that I mean\nIt's just completely insane and we are not adults if we can handle that level of conversation Mm\nGlenn

you know he was funny for Columbus is\nAt the time but he's not really funny enough to be a stand up comedian as we as a side has basically standard\nShow a Michael Moore and tropical ad which cannot twenty sixteen right during the weeks before the election he's hoping sway the election to Hillary\nWhen you when you say it when you say like we saw um I don't think you're yet you should be careful

never\nColumbine and get a lot of young people in their twenties are really excited about that movie\nUh they've forgotten about it maybe they moved on to cheer and chemical uncover their Daily Show and all these other alternative forms of comedy and uh you know Michael Moore as it is you're not really funny enough to be a comic\nAnd as a okay so ... so you are you saying that it's just that he's not funny or that a is there anything can\nBe said for uh the fact that ah this this kind of stuff uh\nYou know you can get the actual people you get the people in office now saying these crazy things so he's not he's not the rebel anymore\nIt's this is\nNot you know he was\nAnd we're a rebels you know alliance and we all got to you know we're all in it together will now you've got Nancy Pelosi saying all the same stuff that he was saying\nRight there's no scarcity value what he does anymore everyone's doing it uh there's a kind of pathetic moment at the end of star nine eleven nine\nWhere he does is Hitler montage instruments that Trump is like Hitler and it's like if you're into playing the speech the Trump inhaler and that's what everyone's been saying Trump is like Hitler the last for about three years is like is the last one to the Trump is that what party it's so boring it's been done to death\nThat is amazing observation of ... where the culture has gone because we have at that point it was a big deal when someone came out and essentially advocated for socialism in America\nI mean even when we talked about with Bernie Sanders and twenty Thirteen coming out with Medicare for all he got no co sponsors on that bill and twenty Thirteen now every major democratic candidate is pitching for that policy and they're not just talking about social you know there's a there's a problem in America where\nWe look at Canada and say that to socialize nation does not that's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah I had you know as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now on the left pointing that out\nThat we're calling for an end of capitalism\nI mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know where socialist like Canadians no no they're now saying no we want an end to capitalism and they're still getting elected\n\nRead like Mars in a in a leader of the parade for a while but now he's kind of ... and ... it's ... it's kind of gotten ahead of them because this movie um\nCapitalism a love story with uh the communist uh at them you see the Soviet Nashville has some ... and that kind of thing is it's not that special anymore as the whole Democratic Party has gone so far left\nSo what does that say to you does that say as I say we're\nIn a lot more trouble than people might think\nWhat does it say to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think the Democratic party is not doing themselves any favor by by moving way to the left about Obama at the time\nWas seemed like Gehring Lee far west but that's that's about as far west as they really should Barrett to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff they should really stay out of this open borders stuff\nThey should stay away from a abolish ice they should stay away from the Medicare for all of all the stuff that they're doing is not helping them at the polls and as a Republican Party as a result is is in its strongest positions in the Nineteen twenties\nWhich is astounding which is astounding for the opposition that it is had 'em and the the the flaws or that it is that is well it's it's amazing that it is this strong\nA and it's only because I think of the Democrats moving so far left agree ... thank you so much Kyle Smith a critic at large for National

about it and how out of touch he is and I thought to myself you know one of us is deeply deeply mistaken because\nHe was saying you know this is this is this election is about Cabot all this election is about the caravan this election is about\nUm ah shutting people up this election is about tax cuts\nAnd I thought yeah that's that's really what this is about that's what this is about\nAnd they of course are saying you know those are just dog whistles set for if if you think that the caravan is not something you should worry about\nWhat's wrong with you if you're not worried about the economy and the effects of the budget and tax cuts um what's wrong with you you just don't see it or\nAre you is your philosophy sill upside down from traditional American or economics and philosophies that

always standing guard by our constitution welcome to the program sir how are you\nDoing great thank you very much good\nSo you um [noise] uh you wrote to me last night and I'm not smart enough to understand it ah you said there is a there is a procedure that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that a set of Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had took a department of homeland security and the department\nOf state chitchat thing that they work out an agreement with Mexico\nA whereby a Mexico would require people who enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from\nOr any of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people were coming from with the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than in the United states\nAnd this would be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada\nAnd a rule imposed by the EU for refugees are arriving in Eu countries from Syria in other words when people were fleeing a country that dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them for some particular racial such a bad one asylum claim\nThey ought to apply for asylum in the first country they reach that could be potentially save your that should be Mexico\nIsn't that normally what happens I mean I thought that when you wanted asylum\nI thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not come to America with your family because you will be turned away if you were in danger come to the closest to us embassy\nAnd apply for asylum I mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nYeah it should be more like that and that's not really how it works and that ... in order to these people and applying for asylum with Mexico they're\nSort of going for the long bomb ill Mary pass and tried to make it all the way the United states but this jury is itself dangerous this journey itself\nI'm right with opportunities for people to be exploited\nUh it it's an exceptionally dangerous journey for many people especially for children and for young women many of\nAre sexually assaulted during the ... and a lot of people claiming asylum\nTurn out not to be able to\nMake the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once they're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back and we think that the asylum application that they're coming by land from Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought Mexico was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I\nDon't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a a lot of potential magnet I agree for bringing people here\nUm if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem\nAgain you you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is a crisis with the refugees themselves\nHaving to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing that when they get here the odds are pretty\nHigh that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event and it just creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nSo Mike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah in Honduras\nSaid have been following the news or on the caravan here

immediately after\nAnd you mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come into the prize\nAnd they found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was not guilty it's crazy\nOne story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment a and another even had him of being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated were advocating violence I don't know what's what ... what are you are you kidding me know that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\nThis is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is so horrible oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators you're supposed to be neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five for writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's got to be killed by the secret service\nThis is unbelievable how is it the two hundred\nJournalists can sign a letter claiming that everything

you disagree they will chase you out of the public square\nThey have no inclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand yes there's little righteous indignation and me it's not an anger is it is righteous indignation because I have\nCalled these people I have talked to these people\nI have gone to them over and over again we've had in hand and said listen you need\nTo understand how half the country feels just have a conversation\nYou're making a huge error and yes I made all these airs oh my gosh I'm the worst person in the world I'm with you just listen to me please you have to hear what half the country is saying\nThey won't do it they're not interested they don't care and now there are quite literally making it up what's the difference between a novelist and the New York times journalist I don't know\nMedia\nIs a radical concept and I know you like radicals you love radical\nYou you feel like there's nothing wrong with being radical mob yeah those are those are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nHere's a radical idea if you don't want to be called fake you might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n[laughter]\nTry to tell her twenty thicker and back or program [noise]\nSelf awareness seems to be dead at this point in the media in particular Glen or maybe this one what is the one thing that if you're conservative Trump makes the ACA criticisms of the media\nThey say hey as fake news hey these guys are relying hey they're the enemy of the people and they say that the same as violence\nLike your your your your ... coming after I was right I Can't go there yet they can't I Can't I got to take a break I Can't go there yet I Can't I Know where you're going and boy does it need to be said I Can't do it yet cat\nCan you needed to do the right I just crank that was that we are now he thinks that's it again I'd been telling you for years to get to your alcohol if we can reignite that it's going to be a good ratings most\nTime can I tell you something the blackouts I Need the blackout right now I Need them so desperate alright it would be so grades I forgot about everything that they said that was so stupid yesterday [laughter] I don't even recall it at all I Love that idea\nI Need to take a break first let me tell you about car shield car shield is uh is is going to save you from a lot of trouble they're going to save you from taking your car in and\nYou've got something wrong with it or even an oil change and then it comes out and they're like are going to miss some bad news for you and we found some extra stuff and it's going to cost and you're like what look\nThese are surprises that nobody wants and everybody gets but if you have car shield you don't have to worry about it if your car breaks down after the warranty expires you could be out of pocket for thousands of dollars just to get it fixed but if you have car shield\nChances are you're not going to have to come out of pocket for anything\nThat if you if you want to take your car into your favorite mechanic or the dealership usually people go to the dealership [noise]\nUh I mean what lately to put it this way why do you avoid the dealership after your warranty expires you avoid it because you can maybe get it done cheaper a by your favorite mechanic and maybe he's not using you know the same parts or whatever you'd have a fix by the dealership\nWarranty expires if you have car she'll no problem\nIt at an alarm you know what one hundred percent survive ability so far on these bombs\nOne hundred percent survive ability\nWe're it is weird now look it could it be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this okay\nSomeone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually or murder they wanted to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually want to\nKill they want to do that if they pull you want to know when you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong totally horrible despicable and everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like my mom\nIf you look on I mean you get this example of it on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time\nYou'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out mhm instead you know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend on doing they don't intend on a you know he felt that that happened to for example Dana lash right like have to take all those things seriously when she was on TV\nUh she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted on those things thank God right so you have these serious threats that come into public figures often in ... and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right even ego to look at terrorists I mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would\nExecute a terrorist attack on on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I ... it is so high it's incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens\nHowever obviously they're not doing it\nRight whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether they're a in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here could be the same thing from a someone on the left\nWho wants to make the right look bad a week before the election or sending these things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make me big media circus you things are all plausible possibilities we have no relatives and know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work in a really all that all the information we have right now\nWell but I Know that's that's pretty much all the information they had on the rice dog fire and um I don't know

president tweeting early this morning that it's funny how lonely rated CNN and others can criticize him that well and even blame him for the current state of bombs\nAnd yet when he criticizes him they do wild and scream it's just not presidential meanwhile investigators say the Manhattan for who sent the bombs is now focusing on South Florida in Miami Dade police department bomb squad and canine unit started helping FBI agents look for clues to US postal facility near Miami\nThis is not like a regular post office with public walking by stance or drop off mail to simply were packages are shorter than than directed upwards of half million\nPackages come through here every day still just maybe someone remember these bombs because of the way they were labeled\nIn between is caused by the Kerry Sanders in Florida and hundreds of us troops may soon be heading to the U.S Mexico border the troops will be guarding against a slow moving my good care of and that's currently traveling north through Mexico\n\nAnd suspicious packages to more intercepted this morning one sent to a Democratic Senate or the other and acts Obama intel official turn Trump critic Fox's Rachel Sutherland does more life from Washington\nA it was started by what's his fat face loud mouth guy what's his name is do no no no uh Alex Jones sixty five percent\n[noise] whatever it is a you know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one so Donald Trump could have done that easy but he chose the fight back\nTrumped it and he said I'm not gonna let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter they see me as a person who strikes back when attacks\nWow I'm going to do that so then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who started this\nAnd you can make a case that Trump's bombastic or attacks on his rivals in the in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that\nHow it how he's he's seven people names yeah he's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your able feeling beaten and kick to death\nBy being called racist and homophobia and everything else came\nLater when it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win\nSee what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything you want to have a chance he was he was like entertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear\nThat's how the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed and I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does okay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors of the New York times not in those words but\nWas very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nElemental Facebook I mean they're on their ... their arms video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump\nCounter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates\nI mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in a very blunt and sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what\nHis choice what if he doesn't do it they are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah you know liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that\nBut he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him and the reason he has it been is because he gives them no quarter yes he fights back\nBut now they're turning it around saying well your your fight back like Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if not fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament\nOh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nIt's the same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it when we see it and we're not responsible for any of it all in all ... us\nNow I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch that so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh how much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times\nLiterally paragraph thirty five in the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened that from the job of course they're cartoon bombs they are leaving it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this is ... there was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy could be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really\nUnbelievably worst bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt it could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these to the press we're gonna send these ... all of the all of the enemies of the right ... obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence them in terms of putting my money on putting\nA button [laughter]\nHow do we how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that is why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flushes out pretty quickly ... how would the press handle what I think that they would um\nLook you have to understand it every morning out of the ah Washington DC think tanks progressing think tanks they send stuff to Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff\nSo that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this uh may be the person sending it was insane ah you know that kinda thing they'll never say\nWell gee maybe um our side is so craves now that we have to criticize our side you're never going to see that ever\n[noise]

the Italians we rounded up the blacks\nWe told people they couldn't vote including women\nBut we're also the people that freed the people\nWe free the blacks and we fought for it we fought and died\n\nWe fought to free the Japanese\n\nWe've brought to free the Germans and all of Europe and the world we fought to free Russia from the tyranny of communism\n\nAnd we failed in the time of peace\n\nAre we good or are we bad is the declaration of independence still a viable mission statement because that's all that is the declaration of independence is a mission statement period\nDo we still hold these truths to be self evident forget about the past\nLet's talk about\nThe future we have never ever\nReached the heights demanded by our mission statement\n\nBut have we gotten better is it still worth striving for we hold these truths to be self\nEvident that all men are created equal that means we're born equal we all have an equal chance\nDon't judge somebody by the color of their skin but by the content of their character\nDo you have\nDo you have everything the baby lane next to you has when you were born\n\nAs far as human rights and dignity\nDo you still believe that\nAnd I'm not talking about well or not the way I Am asking you as an aspirational mission statement that is the mission statement of our country\nDo you want to live in a country that's drives and falls short but picks itself back up again\nDo you want to live in a country that says all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator why would you have to throw God into it I don't care what you put there\nIt just must be bigger than manned\nThe reason why the creator is important is if you don't have something bigger than man then man we'll print and take away rights\nSo if you want to see them the turn of the ... the great cause the most whatever\n\nBut he didn't doused each of us with certain\nAn changeable rights and those rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now there's a lot more\nAnd that's where the bill of rights comes in do we still believe in this as an\nAspirational statement we're only talking about the past we're talking about the mistakes of the past you cannot fix the mistakes of the past with out saying where we're going\nSo where are we going to fall\nYou want to terrorists down there now I read your website I rejoin mission statement I strongly disagree capitalism is not the problem\nCapitalism that is it that has no moral sentiment is but you don't fix that by a state run economy\nBy co ops it's always fails no you\nAnd your allies in the press refused to point out that that is exactly what you're looking for\nIt's a failed system this one has been this one has failed us because it has been usurped\nThe constitution no longer a means anything the bill of rights no longer means anything why because it's not talk to anymore anybody who takes the oath of office in Washington Ninety percent of them are liars not even not even intentional liars\nThey don't know it they don't believe in it they will tell you they do\nAs was told to me by a very powerful individual once looked blend we all believe in the constitution but you know you gotta do what you gotta do no\nNo\nYou do not to do what you have to do that to the ends justify the means we either believe in this or we do not and that is the question America do you believe\nNeutral half assed\nNot sought out sitting on the sidelines all of those answers I mean nothing in the end\nOnly those who know it who understand it who have done their homework who can intellectually defend it\n\nThose are the winter soldiers those will be the ones that restore freedom for all mankind\nEverything else is lip service the game and actually a tool\nIn the hands of those who wish to create chaos and destroy all we have\nAn\nAunt that monologue\nAnd so much more is actually the beginning of part three of my uh book addicted to outrage finding our lunar them what is our purpose anymore rather talk about that with you and those who have read the book if you've read the book\nCow or we have a lot of people uh let me go to a let me go to\nA Scotland in Nevada hello Scotland\nHello Glen\nI'm I just wanted to say that we can be outraged about anything so what we need to do is to turn that negative and positive actions like when President Kennedy challenged America that you get to the moon we need to turn or negative thoughts and chew the positive thoughts\nWell I don't think it's ever been easier do you I mean we're just ignoring all of the positives that are happening to us I mean you know what a moon shot OK you learn ... going to Mars twenty twenty five\nI mean what's bigger than that it's just not a national project do we do we need to wrap it up in national money to be able to get excited about the future\nBecause that's what that was all about the moon shot was all about doing things because we can doing the hard things not the easy things I mean that that was just that was the whole goal and it did galvanized people thanks Scotland you know what people don't think about is\nNineteen sixty eight is when we went to the moon\nSame years Woodstock\nMhm wow yes we are weird yeah so you were either rolling around in the mud or\nYou are reaching for the stars there were two Americas well\nWhere is the America that is reaching for the stars where is that America that says no not gonna stop me\nI I I ah\nI saw post today or that I that I had to answer\nA in my Twitter feed let me see if I can find it real quick um\nThat was ... it's actually this is so wrong what is being taught to children into it to everybody um there was a a person Helen plot grows and apparently fat\nIs my identity and I belong to it whether I'm aware of it or not and even if I'm not this is what I've known for and I'm kidding myself to think people actually think of me primarily as a writer and speaker rather than a fat\nPerson imagine living that way I ...\nI responded ah ah\nTo that as a growing member of the fat community\nI find the real problem is when I look at myself in the mirror and I define myself by my body I Am more than my body you can define me any way you wish it's your loss what you say after I Am\nIs much more important than what others say about you\nSo which are we going to be America because the choice is here and the choices so much more than Donald Trump or Kavanaugh heat is so much bigger than this\nWho are we\nAre we the people that role in the mud and are constantly looking down and ... basing ourselves\nOr we the people that look up\nWe the people that look to the future\nAre we the people that say\nI Am getting better every day\nI Am part of a positive community that is going to make a difference to ...

questions and comments on it if you have read it uh let me go to Anthony in Massachusetts hello Anthony you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGlenn how are you good how are you\nDoing well so you know what can you you you mentioned earlier that are really that the opposition to the people leading the leadership for the Democrat Party or or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four with the inter Korean out a party\nAnd what I see happening with my friends on the on the left is there out a party members they work every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media\nAnd being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a poll or the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts on that\nUh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference and unusual and ... year people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right punching back the people on the left and\nBoth sides suck while they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seen their side being unreasonable violence if you see ...\nThe way to answer ... is not with uh the\nMilitant people it will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets that is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and\nYou don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly\nAs we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer a A R a Judeo Christian country with those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group\nYou have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways\nTo be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where everybody's going to be running in a certain direction and you're gonna have to have your credibility\nYour kindness you're gonna have to be able to stand up and say no wait don't don't go that way\nYou're not going to stop the whole crowd but you'll be able to stop enough thanks Anthony will send you a book uh let me go to a Heather in Virginia hello Heather you're on the Glenn Beck program\nHi Glenn how are you I'm very good [noise] um I\nOverall agree with every book I think it's awesome\nAnd I want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess okay you're you're um you're talking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all the jobs and and I know you don't necessarily agree with everything that you've said that we need at least on the conversation about\n... of it yeah and I you know I think we need to be careful about even I'm considering\nThe I I think that there really is a fear over a I to try to come in and ... that's that's it yeah it's I think that they want to push that starts socialism\nI think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other\nTechnical or a nomination in ... where ... you know the ... they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their ... their problem correct and so\nUm I understand that hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's not gonna take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people\nThat want to create the machines and keep running you know there are certain things I just can't like I'm being a\nUp a leak in your plumbing in her house probably not going to do that\nUm as far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think people are going to\nBe upset if they go into the tunnels and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet is known for their service and I know that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you that first of all just a ... there's ... ... I don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ah what books are you reading on AI what what are you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general if I could not than they work unless I'm sound coming up is it different perspectives are having done that that ... research that I Know that you have sure on that but\nYou know just my feeling like a a I was going to absolutely they will to diagnose cancer a quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nCase so Heather are there is a very and I can't remember the name of it on the ... on this particular subject but I Will look for it uh there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see\nOur emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection\nUm it's going to take a while but it while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while I'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment that no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that through a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to\nGo through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago the uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that is seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today\nYou started your comment about the section of the book where I Know there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income I Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as conservatives must be willing to listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist in Washington I'm Talking about the people who are studying\nOr the culture studying humans and studying technology to gather that are now looking for what is it that will give people value what is it when we do hit high unemployment if your goal is one hundred percent\nService is the guiding principle but Dr Army National guard soldiers to be always ready whenever\nDisasters strike so your your next door neighbors and your colleagues in schools offices\nFor

listening to it I'm On audio so it's it's a lot of fun you did a great job thank you um I I wanted to say thank you for your effort says it and the food section\n... got a little misleading because I think I talk about food [laughter] well let me let me tell you should let it is where\nWhere do you take it I'm a than McDonalds one and the um the thirty one flavors of Baskin Robbins okay it cleaning President Trump I um had been able to use the references and saying that there are some good\nThings about him to my liberal friends and you don't have to like everything about him but there are some good things that many like McDonalds I mean like the French fries\nSo you don't have everything about McDonald's you like to fry is right and so I've been able to kind of ... that in a joking way and kind of get them to maybe see a little bit of\nI like him a little bit you don't have to like him personally so anyways I just really enjoyed that part of your book and being able to use a cause I can laugh about\nIt we can laugh without food and so anyway Kelly thank you thank you very much\nYou stay strong in Oregon or will send you a copy of the book signed to you I'm listening to the point I make in the book about McDonald's is\nIt's one way you can tell if people are being disingenuous if you have nothing good to say about someone I mean nothing everything is bad\nReally really\nI mean even even people who uh you know we're trying to say something good about Adolf Hitler or the Audubon the Audubon okay doesn't really our balance our way the other but oh okay\nYou can't find anything and I compared the news coverage to a bunch of people who are just telling you that everything about McDonald's sucks\nEverything if they don't mention that they okay but I got to

me and help me find an answer and we did we\nFound an answer but it wasn't at all when I thought it would be the answer as it turns out to my complete surprise he's a single digit number [noise]\nA number that was hastily written on a ... posted belt and passed over to me with a handful of others as part of a kind of warm up exercises the seven were just sitting down to begin our conversation as you hear me read all the numbers down to the group several weeks\nAgo three ten pet or why why\nKeep in mind one of them is our answer forward\nLet me start by telling you about the seven\nI Am and the high school teacher a mother of three boys three teenage boy I Am a entire instructor\nI was a police officer in Arlington policemen Virginia for thirty seven years\nI've wanted their politics to be very very different\nI Would be probably considered a constitutional conservative\nI find the older that I get the more progressive and liberal but I become I Am very much on on the side I always vote for the first thing that scares me to\nEven wanted their experiences and feelings about guns to be different\nBy herself yeah shot down in the closet tens or not he had a shot down I'm I'm a retired navy combat pilots\nHave guns in our home they're locked out I've never seen them I don't want to say that ... started shooting I just asked my dad and his redneck buddies out in the country\nThese seven words thoughtful well informed good hearted people who all agreed to spend an entire evening talking to people they didn't even know\nWhy to come up with a list and I wanted to find a link even if it was a very short one specific practical things that we could all agree upon to help combat this intangible threat to our kids that we all think from time to time an intangible threat that a ...\nA teacher in the room explain from the perspective of being inside the schools each and every day\nAnd any time there is any sort of anything other than where I'm at school and the kids get weird they get that in just a feeling among the entire school\nThat something had fully wrong and I think it all over the country I think that you hear and noise in the hallway when you're ISIS quiet and everyone had turned\nWith that awareness we began talking\nStory of that conversation has two parts the content that dumped up with that and then the impact what happened because of what was said so content as we searched for the list for almost four hours\nI'd like to share with you the three biggest impediments we came up against because in this new era of communicating and communication I think there was ...\nDuring remember same children\nSame goal\nImpediment number one opinions outnumber people I Do realize that in this age an unlimited access to opinion that although there were seven people physically sitting around me there were many more opinions and voices brought into our conversation\nListened to the following exchange between two mothers Anna a progressive and Mona a Christian conservative\nAnd see how many people's opinions and perspectives that brought into the mix other than their own\nFrom my side what I hear and\nOh you don't infringe on any of my right and I don't want any restriction on myself and it's kind of and I'm not going to cut you off but this is kind of a bank at Penn and play\nThere are reasonable ideas we can come up with that ... going to inconvenienced\nBy and you're right there are probably solutions there and your reasonable but that the leaders and the movement or not reasonable that that ... is that when there's a school shooting last shooting someplace the first thing here\nWhen a gun control and the n._r._a. has had\n\nSo many other opinions and voiced his most of them extreme jumped right into our conversation on mid thirty nine and everything was heightened from the get go [noise]\nDenise or firearms instructor who almost missed a round table because she had food poisoning speaks about the problem with letting other people speak for on\nThey inflammatory temper you know agitator that are being the talking heads on the media is thinking ... thing for me they don't represent ... that kind of craziness\nDoes not represent me and I would like to think that you know when I say the ultra liberal you know screaming about all that stuff and calling\nPeople like me and gotten nuts and all that I Would like to think that that's not representative of eh so how do we solve that problem with getting the papal from stopping the ones that are out there trying to send a message because for me I think it's the wrong one and it's not productive\nI became aware very quickly that it's almost impossible to have a productive conversation with so many other voices reference to repeat it how can I get each person just to speak with them so\nBut it would take a while\n\nSo let me tell you about our sponsor this half hour it's American financing do is use American financing\nAnd um because he's motor lying and saying uh\nShe uh ... who did you get it for ... you get your loan finally from Vito\nIs that all you got it from a vetoes cousin vetoes ... not to be named yeah 'cause ah who got a little\nLike okay they are what are you give me nothing dial\nUp but if you don't pay I take your children there's some children and I do lose my knee caps right but ... says American financing I mean this is the kind of people they are they looked at what what he was suggesting and they were like a no no bank will do that and know that well\nAnd when he founded another bank he he called them up they gave him advice and said hey you know worrying about this and this this\nBut in the end they said if you can get that deal and you're comfortable with it go ahead go ahead there's right so they're not trying to jam you into something they don't need to sell you a loan and that's what's happening the banks don't give you a loan they're selling it to you\nThese people do not work on commission they do what's right for you go to American financing dot net\nAmerican financing dot net or called eight hundred nine zero six twenty four forty American financing dot net American

Ninety nine dollars to order\nI Know from my side is you know reaching out to my legislators and I think this is what I Want and if the legislators refuse to take action and helping to elect people well or more in line with that thought and perhaps on your side you can get a fair but we all have a part to plant and first is\nMaking our voices heard it might be seeing a child but that's one that we can okay\nBut we are at an event one that I Can't find the right word\nOne heck one step back and started a community level instead of relying on our legislators to fix this problem so you go into the schools and you say the price of all I'm a retired Marine\nAnd my two kids go to the school and I really want to help keep building secure I didn't at all I can do I can only work within the confines of my life and my time but I'm a parent\nHere I have expertise I Want to do something how can we gather the parents in this school to help for to find a bill I think they're probably they're selling a restriction than issues again I mean I don't know I'm not involved in it or or um but\nTwo approaches boats don't valid and worthwhile to me but in that moment it felt very either or\nAnd the little dismissive\nAnd this happened a lunch jumping back\nAnd forth between opposing ideas\nAs opposed to spending time discussing integrating them or combining the approaches and I just hope that the divide over the first approach the constant fight over a ... day doesn't demonize up so much that we aren't able to work together on the second community level approach we need books not only the ruler\nSo those three impediments opinions out numbering people not tearing all the options and either or thinking we're our biggest obstacles and research together for my list\nAnd as we talked we I guess as the they have to be that they are getting louder health and talk [noise] yeah I\nI got a lot of danger\nWe just kept running up against them but then also you can also well they ... the child\nAnd never got around them there\nThat he could then use to act out\nAnd finished you know in in the ... hour after hour it was tense defensive and haunt the air conditioning wasn't working in my premise wasn't working\nAnd I feel like that's what happens a lot both eyes every every time somebody give an example of why that example my son works for them to physically and then\nThey turn into a different conversation [noise] stupid lift was only making us more frustrated the more we couldn't find it because although there were so many moments connection it was a moment of disconnect that controlled the mood of the road [noise]\nWe already have laws on that we do not we do not there are going to only five thousand of them I Would run again let us all of those going there is a ... point\nThe moment I had been fearing\nWe reached it\nNow are you willing to put cameras no\nDoubt\nBecause you're not even willing to let them know the impact\nSoon after an of summed up how a lot of us were feeling\nComing in hair I\nI thought our chances of getting at lists together with with I was more optimistic\nAnd I see why would we are where we are today and it says that sort of you\nConversation ended shortly after we all said goodbye and I sat in the room alone in texted my husband to work is that\nI could not get\nThe enemy in line to go away in that room\nHe's in for a

all it right there yes\nI was not just shocked but personally got it because I found all these people and with the best of intentions I said look out there in the world no one's talking let's try and create this environment with the seven of us that we can\nGo past that we'll we'll know each other you're all good people and I could not believe that with all that ... of them coming in that the the

was only about them they could come up with it\nThe next day I ... I ... couldn't get out of bed and when I looked at my phone there was this flurry of text and email from other people in the room saying how deeply miss we all tried we missed so did you find out\nWell what was interesting with one of the tax was an invitation from Denise star firearms instructor to to Anna\nAre progressive activists mother saying you want to continue the conversation why don't you come down to the shooting range and we can and\nSo I can beat this and Anna accepted in a second I'm shocked and so the next day is progressive activists went to the shooting range at the base of being a raise building to continue the conversation with the firearms trainer and that's where we go now\nFirst and then take out an air to think OK okay\nAnd and I'm also going to start off on a twenty two semiautomatic handgun very\nOK then as I say someone nervously watch them engage each other woman won the memory of their direction from not even forty dollars prior was still pretty fresh [noise]\nThe car and I care and says hey I\nI got a lot of the house\nThey began this new conversation with basic [noise]\nSo how do you take the safety off because they keep the safety on and then it had it ... it depends on the specific type of\nFire says this one\nAnd then they started talking more specifics of the art is Denise explaining some of the existing gun laws that don't make sense\nThat if someone were to hold this like this and turned up against their shoulder and we are now shooting at like\nOf the law and you're technically a\nFelon why would there be an issue if you're holding it as a rifle why why why would it be considered illegal\nBecause now the the um one of the pieces and not registered as a rifle you didn't purchase ... says he purchased it as a pistol and now you're shooting at as a rifle they're saying\nYou're in violation of law\nComplete makes absolutely no sanctions\nAnd then this happened and they were talking about bullet\nStrangling much larger bullet tongues more powder that says a trio and so that's a typical hunting around [noise] so you can just see that the different than the power and penetration to train them bullets and the amount of powder that goes in\nThe ...

I Know I have this evidence I saw this happening and as soon as he ... he's been drinking this morning bill [laughter] wouldn't believe\nThe IRA yeah [laughter] oh you have him arrested yeah he'll I like to be drunk for all of your interviews if that's OK rights to manage it better state\nFor you because you can't understand them sober\n[laughter] that's true that's fair so I'm a ... there's there's one guy who came out and level the accusations and then immediately retracted them and admitted that he was lying everyone likes to focus on four but there's been five accusers\nYeah yeah this is the Newport Harbor guy yes but look when you get when you get into a situation um and and this goes right back to the need to think here we're talking about did you see a ... yes this week say\nIt doesn't matter\nIf individual men get crushed it\nDoesn't matter because women have been abused for so many years and I have no sympathy for men innocent men who get crushed I mean once you're in that zone and we've discussed this before you're into ...\nYou are now we don't care\nYeah you know if some guy didn't do something like ... whoever it may be and and and you get it and your career and family and everything else was destroyed you know that's the price you got to\nPay because of the past injustices a against women\nBut that is that now that is the ... bill that's the combination\nOf post modernism and social justice\nSocial justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation doesn't matter if he did it because others have been in his situation is what matters is\nIs communal justice\nLeaving it it is that other people are talking\nAbout in the media will never report on is it the same people that organized a sponsor boycott against me when I was on Fox News are now paying people to go to the capital to scream and yell at senators\nAbout cabin on the same outfits are doing it move on leaves the league right they've got the mailing list\nThey've got all the information I mean I'm sitting\nThere going deja vu yeah same people so now in addition to insanity like Alissa mulatto individual insanity then you have an organized coordinated effort with tens of millions of dollars courtesy of George Soros and others okay or Oregon\nI sing sending people paying people to go in and disrupt sometimes physically the process and Americans are basically in a dark they don't know what's happening back because this report it\nWill I Will tell you I listen to that stupid New York times podcast they listen to it every day just to hear what you know what's been they're putting on it uh and it it was a it might it made my eyes bleed today I couldn't take the hypocrisy\nButton one of the things that we're talking about is you know I'm really concerned because things in the capital are becoming very scary they're very scary for\nAnd he could be on the phone high right\nRight and they could make an exception I think but you're right\nOkay what else I'm All right well she's believe me I Know on that I thought were going\nThat says if you want me to give you so\nNow we got into the ... give us two minutes not an honor killing the assets\nI look at the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand the evil my mother didn't she lived a very\nI I read your life yeah she's on me which is obviously but she loved me and thought I was good so you didn't understand evil right right\nSo we're seeing so much evil in America are we not\nUm you know people walking in the schools and gunning down kids uh clerics are abusing children um Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof\nThis is all evil it's centered on evil\nAnd so I wrote ss with an eye on explaining to the reader\nThat these concentration camp guards and the people who kill babies and gassed innocent people were farmers and merchants and and bankers they weren't anything trained to do this you weren't assassins they were regular\nPeople and once the war started they put on their black uniform would the debt said insignia and went into the most horrible things that history has ever seen\nIn the book is better than his explanation or\nKill them comes out Tuesday\n... news

I was amazed me\nWhere you don't have to just go see it in comedy is very subjective so you could love someone it'd be like Glenn check this guy out and you could be like not for me yeah right yeah because comedy is very ...\nSubject you can't tell them if you can tell him it's not funny right what this guy's funny to me yeah so that's a that's what I've what I've experienced the harvest\nSo uh you know one of the things that when I when I uh was\nI feel like do they tell you it looked like somebody\nDoes it do do you want to do the you know how that you know how bad it is somewhere colonel Sanders is like I look like Glenn Beck I don't know [laughter]\nThat was going to go to a different direction I don't know if you heard this\nBefore he looked like Dave Ramsey with hair [laughter]\nDavid actually really good like mad [laughter]\nAll right this is making me a little uncomfortable but hey it's a it's a new world set or the U.S [laughter] I was a ... now this isn't helping because those three I'm going into what's going on what I propose to my wife yeah she said no and uh and ...\n... ... what year was a citizen of IDs okay yeah okay [laughter] rational respond to write the nineteenth alright yeah I was just trying to get an era I rode out here you have those so she said no and she said the reason why is because we don't have\nGod in common and I said I'm you know I I Believe in God ... everything and she said you don't go to church and I said I see you every Sunday after church for and every\nTime you come home talking about the people who were honking at each\nOther or yelling yeah they're running the park oh why oh yeah yeah I Know it yeah\nIt's crazy yeah it's crazy how people are in church and they're finding that but they're like they're looking at their watch like on\nThe news on ... ... ... yeah yeah yeah they won out which of these ... these video mountain road rage and the church parking lot because I make all these ...\nI make two videos a week and some of them connect and some of them don't just probably like your content of your books yeah sometimes it's people like yes thank you we needed that sometimes you put your heart and soul into something like yeah\nYou're like what was that one that connected or know that when the connections ... yeah 'cause I don't think you'd have to be a Christian too or good church going person to you've heard about that mhm from your wife and baby like yeah I Know how it goes and they're like yeah then it's just the\nThe what's funny is the juxtaposition of ... that you know God first survivors [laughter]\nHow did you lose it didn't want any steps away\nThe human spirit wouldn't you say like if you like you see someone on T. V. and they're given a run down and you just go\nThat's not right it doesn't seem right that guy's lion mhm you just know because everyone is a human ... like you can spot in sincerity and why that everybody loves that is because everyone when people get mad at my jokes at the live show 'cause you're going to come and the whole crew is going to come to night\nSo to get to come and you know yeah yeah well bring up on ... people people are like stabbing each other we have a ticket to that's what I that's our goal you're right\nI mean it's a good ... comedy show you want a few good yes at the ticket to\nPeople the people are like ... whenever I tell a joke it's like a cross the line I go oh stop I I Know you've got a text each other this personally you're young and I know like right when the radio when the lights go off you know like if there's an interview there like come on it will be real this guy\nLike because that's how you generally said on or they don't yeah that's what human [noise]\nAnd I feel like I've connected with you 'cause you're like to sew somebody's like salads somebody's telling us the truth out here yeah you know what I'm saying and that's what people I think comedy is comedy hard in two thousand Eighteen I go I think it's way easier\nBecause you don't to to cross the line you don't have to say anything [laughter] right mhm it used to be in the nineties you had to say the most profane disgusting I never even I Can't believe this is coming out of someone's mouth but it into does anything we heard everything we've seen everything ... so it's kind of coming back to like a Jimmy Fallon type\nI I I said years ago that I thought the only thing left shocking\nWas what up in individual\nActually felt yeah that's the only thing left shocking you really are feeling and want\nTo say but you don't as I I Can't believe you said that yeah oh yeah well I have a joke at my act about uh like everyone like we're all good Christians in here we're driving down the road and seen that cyclists on the side of the road I Wonder if I just like [laughter]\nLike why is that why does why why it really happened and vet\nThat joke has stayed in my show for about four years because it every button yeah you have what's at the bottom of that you're a ... you want to be the person in church that and then the real human yeah is the guy we all have a dark\nSide yeah ... is the guy now might be something might be better or worse than others some ... some might be against the law and some not bright sunlight\nActually had some of the reason why\nThe the reason why the outrage and the culture and people were coming after cabin are because you were like if if if we can notch him down\nI feel like that's why the tabloids exist\nThat's what I mean what are the outrage exist because you'd think these people are above view the people listening that are ... are like Glenn Beck is up here\nYou know the people listening no okay I Am [laughter] you know they they're like I'm Better than that [laughter] much better that there was always when everybody started down even\nPlaying field and then you get you know that's what you get rich or famous or successful or the c._e._o. see you'll be down here and him be up here is not sit well with people so if we can somehow\nExpose them as a human and that's what I said in my act for a long to every scandal that ever comes out past their politics athlete that headline should be person acts like human mhm right\nYeah well about ... ... well some of them [laughter] some of them aren't related I mean I oh yeah oh you he was drinking after a long day America yeah\nYeah I got to get that yeah that makes sense yeah or like our he\nYou know is the kind of the thing I don't want to get into politics our guys but on the thing with Kavanaugh was agree or disagree on how it goes or whatever\nPeople who said I Can't believe he was angry\nYou rely on January ... you can't you know there's no human on the planet now that you wouldn't go okay enough\nOkay yeah we were like ... there's there's no avenue for like defense he now like yeah like people with somebody came after us the ugly we have jokes about kids with like allergies\nAnd we kind of like make fun of other guys laugh come on [laughter] wow after ... years ago\nThey used to be like back in the day you know like you know like my dad knew how to like tile the bathroom he knew how to shingle the housing mixed race you knew these men and if you'd like asked my dad when he was literally like I Do you need a jacket recognized brazen snowing jak I'm a man yeah right and now kids are just running around like excuse me I have a glue allergy\n[laughter] ragged about how like [laughter] I have a peanut allergy one of the joke I got I got a peanut allergy\nAnd he's like he can't eat the Nazi can't smell the Nazi came and watched Snoopy\n[laughter] and then everybody's like one nothing each other on how we\nNinety Casey as Jane\n[laughter] funny

[noise]\nFor them to the program we're glad to hear a pack great from pat gray unleashed which is a tearing up a the a podcast world and literally tearing it up tearing it uh I Would say pocket numbers I've seen them they're huge yeah they are in it yeah they show it really is it really is into who could be more surprised than all of us but\nThen you get you know who's also doing really well\nA fat so fat so yeah what I'm doing well um you know fat the podcasts yeah the fat with Jeff\nFisher is like I Know it would be all like jeopardy people love Jaffe and ... to us because we hate him\nWe like ... him I Know I had to write a and so I had to write a memo to all of the you know producers and everybody involved in team fat and ah and I was like I'm nobody can be more surprised than me\n... ruin bad guy but yeah it's a you know it out in the ... really impressive\nAll right so a pack ray from pat gray unleash welcome to the program glad you're here\nI'm Glad to be here to argue this yeah yeah I I'm a I'm a it's\nA forty or fifty one forty nine Kavanaugh so they will vote tomorrow however there is one vote for the Republican side that is going away\nAnd I'd love to get first your gut reaction and then let's talk about it okay because my gut reaction was clear and then thinking about it I'm like well now wait a minute\nYou're a Republican senator you are a you're going to vote for Kavanaugh is this close\nYet your daughter is getting married on Saturday ... view cannot cast your vote in any other way you have to be there your across the country so it's one or the other my gut was see America I'm with my daughter\nYeah right I mean yes okay now let's think about this ... you are because this is a senator Danes yeah promote Montana okay so senator Danes from Montana he's been elected by his people to represent them\nEither this is one of the most important in game changing votes or of maybe his lifetime\nOr it will if if the Republican if the Republicans lose this it will set the standard of how everything else goes from here it will teach the left you can do this to anybody\n...\nHow do you ... 'cause my still would say I I go to my daughter's wedding but I don't know how I could\nReconcile that oh well\nIt depends on do they still wanted to vote without his they may not or if they're fifty fifty I say go to your daughter's wedding yeah if it's less let let's play the game though yeah forty nine forty nine essentially you'd have to probably ... ...\nWell no well yeah I mean it but again let's say mentioned switches right now he's a Democrat one Democrat voted for the Republican so\nLet's say ... signifies today or that he can go and and vote for the Republican but let's say he he changes that tomorrow so instead it forty nine forty now that it's not a sure thing you need ...\nI I got to say like my ... inch of hardware that your gun was titled what my daughter but you know and the end you you really think that I kind of had the other opposite thought which was my initial thought was this is really important\nI think if my actual daughter not like a you know now own daughter but like my daughter ... she's getting married screwed this country I Am they're like that's like the most important thing in my life I did sign up for that job but I did not sign up to a band in my family\nNo you didn't put your family can that can be move for instance if the vote is it you know two o'clock\nA that is still what a Montana time noon or eleven o'clock you could say hey move that I'm going to vote at two o'clock eastern time that's eleven o'clock if the the ceremony was supposed to start at noon started it's sick started at three and I'll be there\nBut the ... vote right like move the vote you know they're all they're planning on doing by the way if they need Danes are going to delayed Ollie until he comes back oh jeez delayed the vote well only if they need them right now that doesn't look like they need him we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty nine easy\nThing to do you could just ... it doesn't have to be tomorrow to no no they can relate to it on day yeah or easily yeah or Monday\nBut there's a risk of like you know some new accusation during the crazy thing that happens you know what the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there [noise] but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "05", "locations":

it's mark Hi\nMega did U.S Russia a truly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and\nAnd you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folks started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOh yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nOr tell people what it was ... tell me 'cause I stepped on and tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the hills of these um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts or you're in my shirt of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know the success Republicans\nRight and we'll watch or we're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kind of thing right\nYeah it was a point it was a plant in it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy and\nSaid it was already planning to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that right correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good teeth and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences\nAnd there are no ah you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people ... everything is manufactured everything is made up and so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like can conspiracy\nTheorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense and I don't trust the Democrats never have never let a good conspiracy theory go to ... never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them\nAs soon as I say this is a philosophy\nThat I have stalled for four years on this program is asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that Israel deep state players a\nSoros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm it's [noise] it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to it other than trying to get themselves on the radar but see that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons\nDesperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some Gloria trying to show everybody he can still move the needle in working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirts I used to the rush to excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I had just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd that it was the

I'm Joe ... Fox News thousands of people jammed in intersection and met a light rain for a vigil listening for the victims of the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue eleven people were killed six others injured including for police officers suspect surrender and is now under us\nUm and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out again\nIn this time in favor of the Democrats it started with a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose this at any ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since capital that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party in all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two dozen six midterms\nI'm and I'm which is which is crazy it is a a\n... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen even if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively so relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of\nEach and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now to show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the\nRaces they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\nA band they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that have been losing tens seats from where they are now\nBut also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president so it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that\nThe Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on the train in the house you're still going to have investigative power could have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it have you noticed that you\nKnow places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation\nOf ... oh\nYeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had a bad a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real a real it's really going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\n... there is an interesting group because they are not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten we're at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest then partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that's of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah\nAnd there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone in\nSane right and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever be in writing her life was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I'd go for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way it anytime between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming\nA more rigid in and more of this one could come down\nTo the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this out of here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked about among them a lot about this Huh Interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... come Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense in ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen who was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one\nThis year so this is a whatever the reason while they were not as high as in two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\nIt's I mean the only thing I can think of is\nThe Guatemalan refugees what else has happened I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh\nUnaccompanied minors situation where they're being quote unquote held in cages in July or August ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for it outside after okay um all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrant a caravan situation and that might explain the jump but if it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only place it's low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine percent in two thousand sick\nIt says you know it is our whole lives that this is going to be interesting it is that like it's like\nYou know back in the nineties the opening of Star Wars yeah it's this is now what people care about and they care about it and almost like a cultural entertainment sort of way be which is I think fascinating\nAnd not necessarily healthy [noise] it's good that people care about these things but you know I don't think that people a lot of people don't seem to care about them about the issues as much as they do about just the passionate disagreement with whoever they're on

and don't\nTry to a fashion or at least ... around its neck take it for a walk it\nAin't gonna do it so\nHow do we handle Saudi Arabia well should be the same way we handled turkey but we're not because we're looking at turkey and Saudi Arabia with American eyes stop it these are both Islamic states now their warring with each other why\nBecause one is Muslim Brotherhood and one is a ... hobby is they don't like each other they want death for everybody in the other state\nThey want the regime of Saudi Arabia [noise] Saudi Arabia stopped [noise] turkey because they're Muslim

Islamic rule both of them want to rule uh with jihad and they also want to rule which Rio law\nWe don't we don't want any either of those so now let's put this into perspective Saudi Arabia horrible

who was raped gang raped by seven men not sure if one of them was Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh yet uh but Saudi ... woman was gang raped by seven men\nThey each got you know between two and nine

I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is\nWe believe in law go day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with eternal souls and with dignity that way\nBigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature if you will out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forth\nAnd statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness\nBut we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of stick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about

tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nWhat's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people better I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life liberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about that I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness\nSorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about ah education I I have\nA complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal I hang up before it sure let's start with me I should go into ... absolutely on them when talking about getting rid of all standardized testing proud of high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because they're testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers it's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old\nFeel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across his entire nation to include children one of those reasons as family court how broken that is another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten\nEleven twelve years old why centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way should go or you're clearly these are not a bad idea but ten years old why it to keep control of what's happening in the schools I'm not okay with that\nNow you have a bit of gray hair as I Do hear that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for

control has made things better finished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some low cost control and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't\nBecause here's the problem with getting ready to analyze testing you will lose about we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding it's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not into the world however we could still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose that four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows while riding granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only ones saying these things because I crossed the entire state might say that sixty two counties across the office you to call you the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty ... ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know

right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that the biology chemistry history whatever break

a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now is sixteen I worked at sixteen and lots of people imagine if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at

workable in a\nIn an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything why we're still\nLooking at a system ah you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond me but\nI'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um\nYou are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment\nA and trying to de platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for governor to impede business period\nNo ... no ... if I don't like in the industry or I don't like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should be the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief\nNot not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's always not only\nDoing that he's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nAbsolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around it eat X right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants insurance forest firearm\nNow we can't get it there's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more well how do they need insurance now\nWhen when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nBut for any kind a firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue right and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by the fault no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight\nAnd we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe acts compliant say fact was passed in twenty Thirteen and they say fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal literally what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before a complete legally totally above board you are now a violent selling it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes all the ... revamped of all because of that in other words but it now if you are retired cop what you retire well now you're a felon again\nYeah this is this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy ... constantly who project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired ... that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he's attendance thrown over a million\n... problem leaving leaving\nNew York state over a million over a hundred

I mean it's like Russia really either right groups like other countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing part ... ... ... most likely most likely this guy was killed by Saudi Arabian yeah um it just it just feels like a man and maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the news media wants to look at chick fillet so I was invisible\nFor a while may be doubtful here's the problem we are ... we are pushing through a major arms deal\nSaudi Arabia we should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should it be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and there are probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia go and look look guys guys\nYeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but ah it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate\nHave at it yeah and that's the decision our president is is having to make it's why we should stay out of other people's businesses and stay out of their business can I make a production\nYeah so I think that Saudi Arabia will eventually own up to this because I think the evidence will come after them I think they'll they'll blame of very familiar a photo and they'll say it's the deep state the beach they did this no shelter salmon get him out of their [noise]\nCheck out the lens blog five dining case yes J. dot com keyword Melinde back\nThe checkout blends blog at five Ninety case yes J. got off\nThe word Glenn Beck if he tried to Rob ... morning not bad I twenty five actually looking good coming in from the north from a fountain ... found fifty west south to Pueblo West I'm also after ... city\nYou'll see some minor delays bears your work your way out they had some snow flurries out there can you be overnight hours so you're still seeing some what roads ... otherwise you're good shape\nDuring college former NFL Super Bowl champion signed the most important contract of his life to serve in the Army National guard\nAround a lot of military my family as far as what are my family's overall I Want to go on to make a difference I didn't find that fork in mind is that some new friends [laughter] and then the officer in marketing for my country was just like them\nTo learn how to be part of the Army National guard logged on to the national guard dot com sponsored by the Colorado Army National guard here by the Colorado\nBroadcasters association at this station [noise] which I hardly knew all access to any kind of\nLimited number of pointless you create the sounds directly from life radio station by heart radio I'm fine and I heard radio all three am kinda limited music Colleen went out [noise]\nThanks for listening on your smart speaker news talk five Ninety KCBS J.\n[laughter]\n\n\n[laughter]\n\nGlenda ... everybody on their best behavior we have an Eagle Scout on the phone\nI'm doing great and if you can be very much good we're on our best behavior because I Know you're you're you're are you trying to get your Eagle Scout or are you an Eagle Scout\nI'm trying this on the hook up neither\nOkay All right uh and and what are you what are you doing for your Eagle Scout project\nI Am trying to re Fifteen thousand dollars for operation underground railroad\nAnd and and and why did you pick that as your project um my dad heard about\nOperation underground railroad to you actually and he told me about it and um this will make more of a difference than just\nMake doing something in my community so I Want to do something big\nBecause usually you know somebody fixes up a park or the news you know they do they I mean the eagle eagle eagle projects are are responsible for a lot of really cool things but you have a selected saving children\nI'm yeah I'm fixing up a parking stuff that'll that'll help but it doesn't change someone's eyes for forever and generations after them so\nWhat have you done so far to raise money how where are you on this\nI'm so far as a political campaign out on Facebook and just kind of spread it by word of mouth I've done and I'm forty six hundred so far oh wow but I'm getting there\nYou ... you sound kind of a I mean you're you're very reserved are you [laughter] I mean he's a very you know are you excited about the forty six hundred dollars a year race so far\nI'm really excited and I was expecting I wouldn't have to do a lot more to get that much money and what have you done to to raise that money\nI'm like I said so far just word of mouth I was um wasn't sure what I was going to do next raise money to\nHave you have you thought about breaking into people's houses I mean there are people that have a time they wouldn't even ... they wouldn't even notice that it was missing a ...

with ah\nOur first lady a today and I believe our first lady has a displayed grace and a great composure a and I don't care how you feel about the president I think enough is enough with Melania Trump\nYeah I mean I don't see her I'm In a position where she's being vilified on a daily basis by the press they sniper at her for a long time I'm very charming woman a very intelligent um love shoulder and\nUm I think she's done a very good job as first lady and there's really no reason to disparage malaria Trump\nYou know ... my breaking point was last week when she was over in Egypt and she was over in Africa yeah and the the photos coming back of her were beautiful I mean it was a Ralph Lauren photo spread\nAnd all the press could do was if they published any of those photos or they just tore her down for colonialism and all this crap\nErroneous I Know uh and then I came here she is where\nThe hang on the most beautiful woman in the oval office with the with the greatest style sense Jackie oh they love Camelot and her style she was on the cover of every fashion magazine but no fashion magazine we'll put millennia Trump on\nYou know of course she couldn't go out\nTo their cocktail parties and all that it it it there you do your commentary on the political correct ... percent but back in ... you left out some really big things could never have happened without the ... in support of the media\nYes I put the media in at eight percent directors\nHey let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the size which came out on Tuesday and in that promotion I'm basically saying that we in America are seeing a rise of hate an evil\nAnd I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that are tied it in was that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees\nAnd they said that they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him\nBecause she was a victim of something and he was an idiot for not the siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and media\nMatters within a half an hour says I compared the woman to the third Reich\nOkay\nNow that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never having pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause\nActually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened and Kanye West my favorite guy of all time [laughter]\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I'm I I didn't really need them I was in an elevator with him at Madison Square garden went around me I'd short pants on I mean it was brooding\nRight okay so he goes on Saturday Night live which has staked out territory to destroy Donald Trump because it's good for Saturday Night lives ratings that's why they do it\nAll right so ... goes gets invited to go anywhere is to make America great again hat and and no one likes him and he ... he he's he's brooding again 'cause he's being bullied by Saturday Night live OK fought 'em then because of that Trump invites them\nTo the oval office work ... walks in with the hat\nAnd and uh does ... the president or whatever they did ... okay now why does anyone care\nThank you for sale CNN all day yeah I Know he's talking about what he wants to buy\nKanye West right now Taylor Swift she comes out against Trump All right and she's told everybody in Tennessee\nOut and got them so Taylor Swift and Kanye West do I care what they think about geopolitics in any regard back the answer is no I don't\nNo one else does either this is a tremendous example\nOf political correctness that tiny ... was she was going against the PC so he must be vilified\nSo I Want to go I Want to I Want to come back because you I Need to get maybe you should get a cup of coffee in or something I Need you to get a little a little more animated here built up but when we when we come back I Want to ask you about cars you follow ratings\nThe ratings are falling apart let's look at the numbers of you know from like Beto uh and and others that are running in the Senate the numbers seem to be falling apart I think that there is a change a foot and the Democrats don't see it\nAnd when they get their head handed to them\nOr by the people I think they're going to double down yet again we'll get Bill

destroy human beings is not what America is all about\nYes it's not\nAnd and you know when you think in history Stalin and Hitler and and what they did by destroying their opposition you know later on I was physically but in the beginning they couldn't murder people but they did it other ways\nAnd that's exactly what we're seeing here in America that hate is rising the fear is rising all of this is in play and guys like you and I unfortunately we have to fight against us and then that puts us in the kill zone but to get back to the politics I Do think there's going to be a backlash I'm not sure about the house of representatives\nBut the Senate I Believe will be even more Republican than it is now\nIs so let me let me ask you this if if they\nDo have they they lose the Senate where just a few weeks ago\nThe the person who is in the best position to win for the Republicans was Ted Cruz and he was only one or two points ahead of of Beto\nSo he was in the best position now it looks like they could if I mean if it's a good day they could end up with the majority of fifty four fifty five yeah that's significant\nIf especially with you know Donald Trump is president do the most hated

of a hurricane story but there is a Roche and I'll\nTell you why it's happening okay back with Bill O'Reilly was his new book out came this week make sure you pick it up killing the and then it's really a\n... new song is on the go a diehard radio and five Ninety Casey as Jane dot com\nCheck out the lens blogging\nFive Ninety case yesterday dot com word\nGlenn Beck if you're going to get round

minor delays there's your work your way out they had some snow flurries on their Kenyan me overnight hours so you're still seeing some wet roads from Matt otherwise you're in good shape\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to land on command limit dot com slash tour the places you go if you feel like I Do that the only thing we can do right now with all the nonsense from the Democratic party is to laugh at them\nOr you want to be part of the tour it's are going all around the country can get all the date that Glenn Beck dot com slash tore a there is not school packages books involved and everything else at the addicted to outrage tour going around America\n... should come you should come we should we do anything you know\nA B a camp follower I'll probably go from town to town\nNot an easy come easy city and you should come and we'll do an together\nUm yeah I mean is that um\nBut I I'd I'd rather kind of like stand outside and\nNow you in the San Francisco [laughter] just kinda hey Medicare Monaghan Duvall on [laughter]\nAll right uh Bill O'Reilly a last question here on on this stuff tell me about the press and the numbers\n[noise] okay so what's happening is not just in cable news but it's in all kinds of TV watching is that the machines are now overwhelmed the American public your devices whatever you call it the ... started it they don't watch television anymore um my kids used to they don't anymore\nAnd NOW News consumption is following in that regard so people are getting used to the fact that Bill O'Reilly dot com is there the blazes there that can get whatever they want twenty four seven I'm so why do I have to sit there and wait for some show to come on that's the under fifty five\nSet in America over fifty five they still like their martinis they liked the courts or say like eight o'clock knowing that somebody is on right\nAnd they had then but they're starting to get bored with it back because if you watch it it's not making the same thing said over and over how many times can human being said the phrase at the end of the day we're now at fifty two million times\nOn cable news\nAll right it just in sip it or to the day in sip it um and you you want information you want a vibrant opinion that perhaps as a little bit different you never get it and so it's the gas\nRather than the host the host or ... who they are and you like them you don't but I guess I mean it's just impossible along possible they really get the result\nThe erosion you can see in the demographics it's there on the page every night on the overnight ratings the younger people are going away that's the first sign and then the cracks or once Trump gets off the stage 'cause he drives everything now under ... percent in the in the media once he gets off the stage it'll collapse\nSylvia let's have been a few minutes on your on your book thank you let's let's talk about um you know I Know why you wrote this book to two parallel and show the parallel to the\nEvil and how that can happen um but I'm I'm I'm fascinated by the stories that that you tell in this\n[noise] let me tell you to know so your listeners will understand what we're doing here and there was a concentration camp name ravens book\nIt was for women just women\nIt was north of Berlin and\nNobody ever heard of it of course the concentration camps were kept away from the German people they weren't spotlight it it\nWas known a news report Taj and the third Reich you did what they said or they put a bullet in your head or you went to the concentration camp so anyway at this concentration care was a young woman named ...\nHalf H. U. T. H.\nShe had a German Shepherd dog as most of the ss gorge did and she terrorized women are and participated in heinous crimes against it\nBefore the war she was a seamstress\nAnd went to work and came home and had a ... or whatever you do in Germany okay and then all of a sudden she's in a black uniform I'm killing and maiming and torturing other people are free off after the war ends of free\nComes to San Francisco or I guess the San Francisco on a refugee visa in Nineteen fifty nine alright settles marries a Jew\nEverybody in the neighborhood loves her\nFreezer nicest woman\nFifty years later they get to\nThe state department finally tracked her down sends her back to Germany where she's still alive back and every month gets\nTo the United states Social Security check\n... quite a story huh it's it's amazing how these people just disappeared\nEarly in the day and it's been through a long time going back and forth with Fox with lawyers trying to figure out where it's going to go forward what was going to happen and we we came upon an idea that we're going to separate separating from Fox they said to amicably separating bowling and Fox are amicably separating [noise]\nUm and I looked at it on that day\nAs a as a new beginning and go start and go find another job somewhere and life is going to be great and you're going to sue\nI didn't know what it was going to do and Clinton I I Will tell you that I ate whatever was written about me was false patently false huh it was a lie it never happened and had no one has ever ever\nCome forward it was all anonymous sourcing\nBig long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on to go find another job is could this could go on forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mind for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do we cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day uh I took my wife out to dinner that night and we're celebrating the owner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations new start Pena nice drank on the way home [noise] we got the call or we're driving home and uh\nThe the my phone rang it was a young man on the other side of the phone saying Mr boy and call your son call Eric right away so what's wrong is that just cleric right away I call over there and I'm a girl answered and her name was Kayla he had been seeing her on and off she was crying for some reason I just went right to um is he alive\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] she said no [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] that that was a that was a rough day the next state went to Colorado\n[noise] and the president called me\nAs anything we can do for you I said no thank you [noise] and put it that day and realized that he cared and I'm so for the next few months I made it my mission to create awareness around a opioids\nAmerican or bought his antics on campus [noise] [noise]\n[noise] ... no ... so yeah so that was that day [noise] uh\nAnd so now we are a year in two days after\nThat and it's been rough calm\nYou we can stop and any time if you don't want to talk about anything so [noise] um [noise] but I think it's just important story to tell 'em when you said is he alive why we're there indications\nOr was it just to dad's feelings a feeling of who gets called ten thirty at night and was told to call your son right away without explaining why and I had a hunch and sure enough knowledge turned out to be true so um\nTurns out he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with that no it wasn't a prescriptive antics he didn't know he he passed it was an accidental overdose\n[noise] um so the question you asked me was I going to sue Fox I ... at that moment ahead no flight need to do anything [noise] so um we spent my wife and I just got very close we spent the better part of the next year just talking to other parents talking or any opportunity we could um do you get the word out that it's an epidemic\nExcuse me and uh and\nUh people parents need to know that that their children are at risk and it's a it's a\nMassive epidemic in the in the country young kids need to know that one pill can kill you and not sure what you're taking the parents need to know that your child isn't too smart to popular to Atlanta to be exposed to potentially dying from an overdose\n\nIt's a very emotional and I think important um interview there are\nAre places that I Want to go and Eric has promised to come back but I didn't want to dog pile we recorded this on uh September I think ten of\n'em and it was just a few days after the one year anniversary and he was very very very raw um it's the first time that he is really spoken out about it um and what his thoughts are and I think everybody no matter what side you're on the opioid thing\nSo in other words a person who is supposedly protesting for women's rights violently attacked a woman for\nExercising her women's rights at this point it is impossible to keep up with the contradictions I've lost count on them however\nIt's yet another warning that we are slipping into a zone that we have not seen necessarily a before or at least in a very very long\nTime we\nCouldn't use our star for this movie and we've convince them to ah let us use Steve to uh do a program immediately after this and welcome to the program now Steve\nDay so are you I'm doing well get to see guys that were really really excited about this starts on Monday\nYeah starts on Monday he's still going to be on see our TV's still gonna be doing it see our TV thing but\nHe's doing a two hours of for us every day tell if anybody if they don't know who you are explain who you are [noise]\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] that that are just moving in with pat when you say the second best one hears that have had it he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your number\nTwo [laughter] to help move in that way this is why he is a genius [laughter] do you\nKnow we actually talked about the things we're trying to conserve a the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them\n[noise] ah because we think that one of the big problems in our country there's this idea that we're really divided in were arguing all the time 'cause we're not argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the ... factory uh of of the the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convinced for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs at our neighbor over there we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nAh you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend ... and I'm perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them by myself I had a doctor or a Denver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had David Reuben who else a stew here recently Michael reckon walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything mhm but I'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress there is\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd a liberal and a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees either maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and new arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nAt any somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you a little league game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and the left is that you know liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nLondon is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God's says or immoral and dumb than us Erick Erickson likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are the outside outside of the Haiti arena I agree that there are you know I see people people think\nThat I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no\nPelosi I Can't talk grilled cheese no interest in she has the auto industry wants to end you want to share a country where she just it's the best thing is is that you could possibly say the most cherished\nThe thing on both sides is they just want to win mhm so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped um and that's a dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot I talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen she got pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd roe v Wade happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheat and want to be a kid in the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people what they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than men for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more in conservative media we disagreed with and bring it up when we got together as a family has gotten away everything funny things happened the last few years though guys she's bringing it up now to me\nAnd she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news that are earning later I Can't I Can't ...\nDo you watch them never that he was it was up when I'm On the year ... from India and unless that status and hang on just a second I Want the audience\nTo know that's unheard of in our business ... that you could not have done is ... without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go viral and social media long form it's just toxic ingestion and the vast yeah yeah my mom watches a lot more of this she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant woman but one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election\nAnd she brought it up she started bringing politics that to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watch the things he says and he does if he's actually a communist [laughter]\nLet me away filed okay yeah um and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is fine whites Obamacare\nThinks that Medicare for all his okay we need to be up to provide things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail because she's not fine if we we get five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not fine with\nThat ... so I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help and so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like communists right and so we have\nWe have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communists they don't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is provide that cover has provided cover if you will for the actual Marxist communists that are that are trying to say and capitalism\nWe when you look at you know for the last twenty five years I've been involved in full time a political advocacy either as a host or an activist or I've worked on numerous campaigns are run the gamut I've done everything in our movement other than run for office basically myself\nAnd I'm ... when you look at the for the last for all the course of our careers that GOP consultancy industry has has designed a strategy to chase a voter that does not exist and this is filtered down and did the talking points we in conservative media get from these people\nAnd that is that the average GOP consultant believes America wants on wants limited government like the Koch brothers and Saddam and Gomorrah at the same time it actually totally in reverse the majority of it and and you know it's fascinating is Putin a huge study on this\nBreaking it down in the twenty sixteen electorate at the bit libertarian the myth of the libertarian voter as how they define them that their voter largely does not exist as a unicorn okay the reality is and I've seen this on every GOP campaign for every candidate from state house to president I've ever worked on\nThe amount of pushback we get on our social beliefs compared to your the party of big business who wants to leave me off and doesn't care about me guys tend to one at minimum it's not even close and then the reality is most voters are in favor of bigger government\nWith better moral values and this is the secret sauce that Trump tapped into in the last election the irony is that the ultimate heat and dust\nAbsolutely embraces all of these cultural flashpoints he didn't say he didn't give you the token I'm pro life he stood up in front of a hundred million people at the presidential debate and said I'm going to appoint justices that will overturn roe [laughter] okay\nTill things then we're at the point where like in our anniversary yes I knew that it was tomorrow trust one eight hundred flowers dot com\nThey have you've covered in right now when you order a dozen red or multi colored roses for only twenty nine Ninety nine one eight hundred flowers will give you another dozen plus a vase

at ten nine central on ABC\nCheck out the lens block\nFive Ninety case yesterday I got word Glenn Beck today sixty one for a hundred and thirty five and I'm sixty seven in store for his on Saturday big change on Sunday snow likely only thirty one drop [noise]\nWelcome to the program so glad that your hair returning with us Steve days pat gray a stew a steeper gear or executive\nProducer and of course my charming self um we're talking about uh the Democrats in what they have done this week just with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't have a civil conversation with these people\nI don't know who these people are that these people used to be a sign of racism uh but you can't talk about these people are and then Eric Holder in the week that we have a video of somebody actually kicking a protester ... um we have ever called her saying a kick 'em when they're down\nIs is the is this the\nOr is this the beginning of the end for the Democrats or is this the end of the beginning\n... ah um I I Hope it's the beginning of the end\nBecause um I I think most Americans with the ... with many sensibility left in them\nUh are being turned off by the Democrats right now I I think they've you know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four a goal but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings and all that's going on now with the stability thing\nThat they're completely ah issuing I think I think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change a say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this leftist no movement\nI I think it's the latter mhm and I think that um you're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition happen\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the right that just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't going to have any repercussions whatsoever and now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nI and we're we're we're not even I don't even think we're polarized anymore\nI think we're Balkan iced if you get the reference I'm making here so okay let's let's pick it up\nThere how do we um how do we come come back and ah how do we start reaching out to the people who actually do have\nMuch more in common with us because\nThey do believe in the bill of rights even though the people in Washington may not back in ...\nGlen ... show on ... news Tong five Ninety Casey as Jane\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nGlad that probably [noise] so I talked about this a little bit on the news and why it matters last night uh and I and I asked the group it\nWas a turning point for the Democratic party the leadership\nI think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they didn't hide God three times and their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm\nAnd you are you are seeing\nA in you're seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ...\nPeople don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but there we are repeating the Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive as him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it's looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them\nOn the table at the moment is or a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you're right but I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our ... that\nHad decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically and so they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nBut and it's because they don't understand that progressive isn't isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is if this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dose in Darwinism it has its own it cleans the allergy where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts and said when the government removed the God the government will become the God and that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from leftist when you trigger them on their on their state isn't\nIt the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation\nWalk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen is a Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and the kings seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan said this guy say I'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes\nSure where in ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan because your life will be ... and that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor\nYou're you're attacking their idol this is not mere political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement vicious religious fervor you're dealing with the loose it sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that a dissertation dialing the understood about ten\nPercent [laughter] famous short were they so\nThey can translate that into human language [laughter] uh I I I think we see that with\nGlobal warming with a with their reaction to abortion was loose roe v Wade thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things ... it it really is a religious fervor\nYou know that you see with them and and this is kind of the the point of the ... ... ... is\nThis is ... is the his\nYeah they do and you're right if they don't necessarily know they don't know but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children he wanted your children\nIt'd be sacrificed on an idle you would have permit skew is sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods and the girls in the groves and then\nWhen you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby right I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period who himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff because we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program",

most Irish people are called better so yeah the point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls was one poll that had them tied at one point\nUm ah ah several

calls\nWho was voting for who when you see the poll build slowly as you watch it it's addictive do watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I add one point yesterday um the Texas Senate poll they had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls\nAnd had two hundred and eighty five people who

to buy these steps but um you know you look at the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation that high employment I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still high on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what's the scoop did\nWork good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the fed and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly move people out of stocks and bonds because when interest rates rise than\nBonds are more attractive relatively than stocks I'm usually those facts of of ah\nFat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we used to or she real science of inflation although energy prices are rising but you know bother from out of these are are pretty stable or or actually falling and price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to this is\nThe fed and and a ... journal drawn Powell why you've taken a punch bowl away from this party just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think\nThat he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just because the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation would never leave lesion watcher guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and and the tax breaks and we haven't seen it\nWe're showing inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but\nI did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and that\nTrade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I ... my only point is I just think the fed\nActed preemptively and prematurely and raising rates in in a in a way that wasn't that sort I Am a little concerned by the way I go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like equivalent of four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why hasn't gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon soon are you there yeah maybe I didn't hear what you just like okay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the I'm In the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um you know about the price of the global\nReduction in supply as a result\nOf having sex that back online bring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nOil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean I don't know where you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick stick\nOn the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next year or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just here you know that's the stock market is driven by fear in great [laughter] that's true is up for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and then by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred\nI said to my wife I let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me [noise] um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale\nBut the last president that I heard really take on the fed [laughter] was Ronald Reagan and uh we had Nineteen percent interest rates right certainly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on why the president as his chief executive officer of the country right he's the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct type\nI I think there's a lot of one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or uncles on high at the fed they act as if they're the temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence\nBut they've made so many mistakes you mentioned I remember the seventies as you do when we had literally twenty percent mortgage interest rates that was all because of fed mistake and I you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis\nTwo thousand seven and they keep thinking these people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know I don't know\nLet me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nUh and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars are and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think is it even as what he really fundamentally believes that tariffs are good\n[laughter] here's my view I talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I Know trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals he got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a federal here or he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before that\nThe deal had to be seals candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and this is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with I don't know you and I haven't talked about this one but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating\nStealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics are using all I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nUh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction or when it comes to China then I'll let\nMe challenged beyond that whenever I uh you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way chop looks at it and I think he's right about this like if we can't trade with China we'd sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't their ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets mean damn near everything\nYou buy in Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that card and saying look\nWe're not gonna give you an unfettered access to our markets if you're not going to play by the rules I talked to a company CEOs all the time of blind who basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market yeah you got to give up ownership of your company has to give up your trade secrets ... I mean we can't live with that is right I'd write when he says look I didn't start this trade deal\nThis trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't big they also weren't our bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nHey Stephen quickly one quick question for you know you probably have a real insight on the ah the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs in these things going on of allies\nAre ... like Canada and as a way of negotiating to bring these country off at the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA two point oh type of situation well that happened but the steel tariffs are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change at any point\nWell this is what are the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy lyric I thought so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum tariffs or auto terrorists but especially not steel and aluminum because you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto but\nWe've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produce I was over at and how is your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make\nA you know Budweiser is they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans and they showed their prices are going up and ... that's going on around the country our auto producers are autos are more expensive because the steel tariffs so my point to Trump is this isn't even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of this so\nSince showers Rob today today fifty two for a high ... thirty seven for low sunny and sixty

Ah yes there's a lot to ah to understand about where that's going to get into that I'm sure we start there or do you go to start with some of the hurricane stuff\nUh well I don't know if I Want to talk to somebody who cannot agree with NBC News that are not natural disasters these are man made disasters now\nSo it wasn't manmade that we want an entire decade basically without getting one hurricane hitting the let me ask you something about that sir yeah\nUh would you agree with me that over the last ten years in the last ten years mhm we have seen a dramatic increase in hurricanes here in the United states since we dropped out of the Paris accords\nYes sir no sir is a yes or no answer\n... you're saying has it gone from zero to two and the time that\nI mean since he's been out of that or ... I mean the trend is not increasing that we we have one year that had more than another year is that what you're trying because I'm at I'm asking you in the last ten years and have we seen a cup of these ...\nThese so called natural disasters I Want to just in the last couple of years\nThank you for your question NBC there has been an increase from all over the years they give very much [laughter] that journalism these days it is here's what the PCC\nSays remember this is Al Gore's a favorite place to go for climate information and this is what they say about hurricanes numerous studies toward the end beyond the fifth assessment report of the Irish ... eh PCC have reported\nA di di di di di\nGreasing trend in the global number of ... of tropical cyclones and or the global globally accumulated psychotic energy there's low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cycle numbers under global warming over the past four decades there's consequently low confidence in the larger number of studies reporting increasing trend in the global number of very intense\nCycle is the view and I ... a CC reports the latest the latest update\nTo bring out of a boring un talk what they're saying is total number of a hurricane's going down and there is low confidence in any change in the I'm In ... like what they say it's like well because they used to say there's going to be more frequent intense hurricanes than they realize the frequency thing wasn't happening there it's going to be more intense they don't even have evidence of that and\nSo that gives me Mr ... here is this not the strongest storm\nA ... on record did that is hit value Florida Panhandle that is the report you sir I rest now here's the summary [laughter]\nAh the PCC once again reports that there is little basis for claiming that drought floods hurricanes and tornadoes have increased much less increased due to a greenhouse gases that exactly the story you're getting on the media when they're trying to say we have ten years though we\nHave renewed this they've they've they've up to their commitment and in response I tell them up yours and [laughter] so [laughter] ah [laughter] it is a pretty remarkable okay let me let me ask you this as we get into the poll numbers\nI Believe there is a chance we see a red wave because of capital\nThan we were concerned that there would be this massive blue blue wave in both the house and the Senate I think we see a red wave not a tidal wave but a red wave\nIt's possible first of all I Would say Kavanaugh if\nIf the last two years have been any indication Kavanaugh will be ancient history by the time this election happens it's like three weeks from now I like these things go away for example uh the the Access Hollywood tape happened right about this time in two thousand sixteen\nRight about now Tobar eighth or ninth in September eleventh that I\nUh and that by the time the election came as we saw had basically no impact on news ... I mean this stuff goes away fast and I think there will I don't think this is because because it's not just Kavanaugh if they would've yeah left\nIt alone leclaire Williams but they're not they're doubling down Hillary Clinton yesterday we can't live with these people\nI'm a Eric Holder comes out that the news today that he says when when they go low we kick them and the crowd cheers and this

take medication every day we're all paying a copay almost every month\nIn the big picture um are the changes from Obamacare a there's a lot of high level stuff\nOut there and maybe we don't even want to go down that road because I I think none of us really know and maybe you don't either all where this is all going and so you know a lot of times you're just trying to to to to provide products that really meet the needs of the of the clients white here in southern Colorado\nThat that that need so yeah we'll avoid that subject but I think\nYou know where where it's all going I'm sure you we all scratch our heads and and maybe you know he met is no different you try to you know to continue on this track 'em in the time that we have I Do want to talk about some of the supplements and Medicare and I must admit I'm One of those that I don't know a lot about it\nBut the the Medicare ... supplements I think are valuable ... can you wonder if you explain that to where we position is in our families and our futures [laughter]\nSo that's where we as agents branding I go in and we make sure so the first thing is what you know like I said before what keeps you up at night while I'm worried about hospitals I'm worried about these so we'll do that needs analysis so supplemental are what they are\nYour Medicare is going to pay first or even your individual and then you're supplemental insurance is going to come in and pay what's leftover or depend on the plan what small co pays you may have or out of pocket you may have\nUm [noise] you'd does range from there's got from a through and\nSo those are quite a few out there that you can kind of look at it and very they're very him priced too so\nYou may be paying your Medicare premium plus you have to pay that supplemental premium and that's where a lot of families may not be able to afford that bigger premium so then at that point that's where we go okay well let's look at this other option\nMay be Medicare Advantage and I think brandy can cover Medicare Advantage a little bit more of that said\nYeah and with with the supplements to you also have to have a prescription drug plan a lotta people that we run into they were like why do we even I don't take medication I don't want him a prescription drug plan\nA lot of people don't realize that Medicare penalize if you if you did not get a prescription drug plan when your Medicare start and that penalty goes for life so it's kinda scary to think about but that's where the Medicare Advantage comes in and we kind of put everything altogether\nOr we kind of think about it as a Sean does it really well it's a combination played at the Mexican restaurant where we we put it all together we put your medical your prescription and everything else all in one plan and it really covers everything or under one umbrella\nSo when the chips are down we need to solve so we need to we need to solve this is I think this discussion is really good because I Know so little about it and I've said so many times this is a team sport\nYou know this aging thing is a team sport there's so many things that we don't know the island theory is the more you think you know the more you find out you don't know so you really need a a team of professionals around you\nUm we're talking with you man of brandy Johnson and Sean modest and uh and uh what I'd like to do is just quickly just cover if you if they've got questions on this subject and they would like to\nDo to have some more information is there an office number that they can call you at [noise] I'm\nActually on our office as we stayed at the beginning of the show is in Colorado Springs the best way to get a hold of Sean and I are on our cell phone okay and my cell phone number is seven one nine to three eight six three five five and Sean's is seven one nine\nTo three seven four or five one nine\nOkay and we're going to do that again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it or will be able to to give you more this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that that you face was families you know you're walking into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming and then we we don't know what's gonna happen\nAll insurance is or what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect you and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nThe defense team yeah yeah just because you're going to see things coming that we don't see how that are still sort of amazed at how complex\nThis whole this whole system is Shaun how 'bout you what ... what are some of the challenges similar or do you if you walk in and you've dealt with families I'm getting there do you think getting their affairs in order maybe one of the big things people need to think about\nI think affairs in order huge because we'll all my kids can just throw me outside or my kids can pay for things and you're going\nNo ... I bet you if we made a phone call they probably say how much is it what do we need to do so um but yeah I I Would say truthfully we're all used to a corporate world where we have an HR person that says here you need this take this\nWhere we all retire and all of a sudden we're going what do I do where do I go\nThat's where I ... you could say brandy and I are your age are person because we can help direct even I I'm a big believer even if you didn't picky man at least we helped you make a good choice in what you're going to do next right or where to plant and what to do\nYou need a strategy team to guide you so I think this is a great discussion and they were going to ... come back and just a few moments in kind of close out the show and we'll give you the overview to ... ah you're

J. lo\nAt ... dot com and on your phone with our high heart radio after [noise]\nRaking from another agreement I'm Joe cheer on Fox News President Trump says he will pull to us from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia because he says Moscow was not abiding to its term\nSure well we're bombarded as you know by all kinds of information and all kinds of media sources or\nA you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors or have always working uh you know even even when they listen to their their favorite commentator they're still\nKind of you know it's the see the human hand you know and everyone knows humans are kind of already an adult when people are you yeah\nOf course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine they turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause I think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust\nAnd it's subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed him in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it now we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track\nYou know that is scary\nIt is you um you leave this out in the in the creepy line I'm about\nHow Google has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda\n[noise] um and then uh how they have ... you know\nThat when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this and the national a study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or in a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nYou know being able to spot the bias does not protect you uh we did have a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen Ninety nine point five percent of people in the study a casino bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism\nUh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs are in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability\nTo shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs\nOr around the world they are doing so twenty four seven days there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\n\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know Wilson and Bernays a in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the this is the system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda\n[laughter] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called a can of ways big tech can shift\nMillions of both in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA that's just one of ten ways\nAre that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they're I mean some of these effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they're ... years and there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand sixteen early two thousand sixteen uh working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people were seeing while they were using\nThe Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system itself was a first ever created and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty late and that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nOr you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them\nAnd uh I don't think we should be surprised\nThat we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually be able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world\nAnd will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point\nUh you know I Wish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but we will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which Glenn\nIn trouble [laughter] what\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm who started the race [laughter] All right\nLet's let's say that are a very good the good and the good news I mean the the good news is\nThat um that Glenn Beck dot com right yeah and your email service that you use a ... is is you are not sharing information you're sharing your emails with Google Now\nInteresting left in New York Times\nThe times of London the economist wired magazine slate I could go on and on and on may share all of their emails all the time with the Google and other sensitive documents too and so reporter is when they're doing\nYou know very sensitive investigations on something they're sharing everything constantly with Google and I wrote a piece about that was in the Daily Caller a couple of months ago the good news is you don't do that\nYou're okay let's end it there for just like this has been asking that for a second\nIt will come back with the bad news plus the the I think he's in different ways that Google is influencing us and not just Google but these big tech companies and\nSome of the other things that uh he has found how they are monitoring our children and it is remarkable and we are running out of time before Google is the dominant than just can be stopped [noise]\n\nAshley suggestions at you and Amazon and it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you\nTo turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split\nWill my one having any idea they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh\nOkay we're going to come back and uh and go through the others if we have\nTime he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the ... the line\nIt's a new documentary the freebie line dot com the freebie line dot com um\n... news talk on the go diehard radio and five Ninety Casey as Jane dot com\nClient that probably\nDr Robert ... he's a senior research psychologist American Institute for behavioral research and technology he is I'm In a new documentary called the creepy line we talked about a guy saw again it is indeed very creepy it is\nUm it's it's is it too much to say it's\nWe're on the ... were apps mind control or the threshold of mind control\nDoctor [noise] [noise] ah well we've been here for a long time so there's a you know there's no question about it there's they're literally right now more than\nTwo point five billion people soon to be over four billion a whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected are dramatically uh every single day\nBy a some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that's that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I I just I I Want to reset that you did a study during the last presidential election\nYou are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were\nTrying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's only one way we then have the search suggestion effect now target messaging affect\nWhat is the target insurance hurts the\nShura targeted messaging T Emmy we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing effect is really scary ah this\nThis means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to but if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November two thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders uh mainly to supporters of Hillary Clinton or exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that was even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day an additional four hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh\nI don't I I don't think he did that because you know he was very overconfident a you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not I'm I'm a ... a moderate and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was gonna win so\nI'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts votes and think about it no one knows if it's something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't what\nTargeted advertising is all about but you see targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something less competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive ...\nI mean this is so dangerous\nUm and it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has envisioned forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] Oh yes they can they in fact they know who's an unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it\nI mean ... I mean on the table mentally yeah\nYeah yeah oh no you're you're absolutely right they have it literally unprecedented power or to ... ...\nIs shifts to people's yes shift to unstable people's shift anybody\nUh and and they know they have this power\nUh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their eight minute film called the selfish ledger you want to get cranked out [laughter] botched that film that's an internal film there were there they're talking about their power to reshape human kind\n... news talk on line at\nFive Ninety KCBS Jay dot com um\nLast summer when bitcoin was down forty\nPercent and trading was about two thousand dollars are going to get to worry from the Palm Beach let her go to expert on everything crypto wrote that bitcoin would hit ten thousand dollars by the end of the year people thought he was nuts we were in the middle of a horrific a bear market but it was right it hit\nTwenty thousand dollars will now seek saying bitcoin could be up ten times or more by the end of this year that means it could hit forty thousand dollars by Christmas I Am a skeptic pot you need to understand\nWhat bitcoin is what crypto currency is and what are the triggers because this is game changing technology and life changed\nIn investment even if you put a hundred dollars in bitcoin but you have to educate yourself first do that by getting my exclusive Glenn Beck crypto course from Chico right now it's smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or call eight seven seven ... back that's eight seven seven PTO back\nIf you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you should consider cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device for just Ninety nine dollars cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone and it fits in your pocket you can take an EKG anytime anywhere to order basic cardio dot\nCom that pay A R D I ate dot com give you feel heart racing or other symptoms\nTaken EKG on your phone and it just thirty second you can have peace of mind to knowing your heart rate them as normal cardio is also prevented attacks atrium relation a comment heart condition and a leading cause of struggling to order cardio mobile today music cardiac dot com that the K.

for the U.S withdrawal from the Nineteen eighty seven intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nAnd I ended up killing one of these hey hey\nUh to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um reviews standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned or was it was really fun I live in LA fun right hum that he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight out of that um but yeah so we learned our lesson\nWe took the criticism that we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work\nPeople criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead\nCommitted to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollar they charge\nLike a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people\nTo address it a secondly we decided that that um we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we hadn't gone crash and burn complete failure than um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and voted that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um\nUh early on in the process not just to keep us honest 'cause I think we would have kept our promise but early on in the process\nWe ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took\nMay be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I talked to hell and the other day yeah\nAh so this was in in in the men's amount of work it required learning these field very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple of year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow\nYeah it's a lot of work there was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily\nHaving to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing author only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of the the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals\nAre for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to the university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers banning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned the ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know un un twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would've gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end or do we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we'll we'll go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter]\nSo er hey as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and credible where they got a little gold star for [noise]\nGland

quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the\nProgressive stack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey judge it says this is a start says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged few are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means they\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to be in very privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper I thing we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign\nAnd they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being converted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's\nThe worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claim for example that we grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nOn but um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over\nInterrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat what if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that\nMean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm\nThere will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some are educators primarily working in social justice\nSize field topics\nCourses I

surprised at all if he comes out and it does endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there are many of them are co sponsors of the bill uh it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are\n... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYou know we were scare mongers and racist for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stories will go through this tomorrow but if I\nWent to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\n... no that is a fundamental um a a a a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything well then ... what do we have it can't be that way\nSo we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose taxes and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter\nIt will be those three states you\nLock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore that pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected\nRight on my way up to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this was an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but\nThere is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities I mean that's you know it'd be which it wants that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\n... cities should run themselves in the cities can read whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want why do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb\nFarmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has\nTo do and how to live they don't understand taking any of my former friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's\nWhy the house and Senate both exist to give balance to that so that ... not not one side can\nHit it right you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further\nThen this if you would have if you could have raised the mistake of the\nUh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate the way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the ... the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York it says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator Brock Obama was senator\nI shouldn't care about that because they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas way no that's the opposite and is the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed [noise]\nAre you arguing for king right with these the several stories in our own MIT give you the argument for king\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed\nOr no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure part right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but\nI I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ... the Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ... can anybody just get up and start directing traffic in Portland and they just didn't I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise]\nI mean especially if it was a union job really they wouldn't be you'll be in the bottom of the river [laughter] what what what\nLaws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chase him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob and yes and I did use the word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland but they had a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march

numbers hello sue\nTell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get to see what the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category yep I'm biggest holdings been close and now we start to\nTry to move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races\nOr we have moved uh Missouri\nAnd Indiana into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident us Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican but the lives there was a Ted Cruz's still lean Republican state\nA ... and a a Mississippi and North Dakota is going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure toss up still and we couldn't really moved them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points plays falling has a lot closer a really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tops of category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race 'cause you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\nA movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one is a lean democratic state um we've moved from Minnesota as well from safe Democrat to leaning Democrat pulling their you know\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but it the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well or was a tossup races for most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point uh and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for the Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is a lot of starting to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans in the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big hope for pick up again this was a state that voted for Trump by thirty points\nAnd Joe Manchin I think he you know I think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kevin Olival yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's that the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slightly nervous we're moving these days I Would normally keep those in the tops of categories of or a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now I mean people are voting all across the country right now uh it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and give us some of those results on the house church\nThat lecture and by numbers\nOn the Glenn Beck program\nOr want to tell you about our sponsor this half hour it's filtered by a filter by is a great service really

I've owned house after has never\nChanged it you've never changed it in your life never\nI just did adjusted first time because the filter by young soldier by is just a way to its way to like skip the responsibilities of being a man he had a veil just do they just send it to you so you don't have to remember ... and I know with you you just had your wife do it\nNo I actually went well well well I mean is there I was there\nOkay well I ... I took the filter I took it from the front porch and\nI said honey where the hell are the ... where do we change the filters\nAnd she said\nI think it's upstairs and so she went to one direction I went the other direction\nSome might say I knew it wasn't in that closet mhm um and ah interesting and so then she ... and so she found it and\nShe pulled the other one out and I'm like oh great well here's the new one and she put that ... you know ... does well so you were there I was there well it's interesting when Osama bin Laden was killed fellow al\nUh executive order to end birthright citizenship he's talking about\nUm he's been more aggressive right and that that may be good it may not be good we're going to see right now\nI don't think it is I think you know look you've already made your mind up with Donald Trump and then there there's a point to where he like I don't want any more information I don't want any new information or I Know what I mean I'm I'm I'm happy with the way things are going but I'm not thrilled with Kevin continue just\nHelp me as a citizen I just feel like everything is normal you\nKnow what I mean ... and he reminds people in a normal and right before an election that's not necessarily what you need\nThat makes sense ah yeah I think that's probably true because he made his strong stand with Kavanaugh he made that strong stand we know where he stands on the border mhm there's no reason to to get continue to dog pile\nAnd and quite honestly I I Wish he would stop the presses our enemy I understand what he means and I'm going to be doing some stuff on the press today a that is a a I mean it they're out of control\nBut that enemy the you know there is the enemy of the people it's just bad phrase allergy\nThat makes me feel uncomfortable I think that we have to also back up and say that this is not just the just the Trump election right offices election for individuals in individual districts and there's a lot of storylines particularly in the Senate where you know there's a lot of storylines that could decide it I think the issue or overall however uh there's a\nThe momentum the is not in favor of of Republicans right now particularly in the house and you're seeing more movement or it's dangerous to the Democratic side right now but I mean they know who knows I mean this doesn't mean that that's the way it's going to turn out\nUm it's just it's not you hope to be having a nice run right now where you're going to the image like for example the lead up to the presidential election was a positive run for\nTrump in Denver and Republicans remember they you know\nMonth before but I'm an eight or nine point they close that gap all the way almost with polls are so it was not a\nThe momentum clearly showed it was behind a Trump leading up to that election and obviously he won here it's a little bit it's not I wouldn't say it's dramatically to the left but it does seem to be leaving that would get out and vote do not sit this election out get out and vote ...\n... news talk on the go diehard radio and five Ninety Casey has changed dot com and um\n\nShakeout blends block

talk five Ninety KCBS Jay [noise]\nClaimed that program [noise]\nWelcome to the program Mr pat gray who ah receipts this program on the blaze radio and television network a and also has his a podcast that you can listen to and download at your leisure ... welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship\n... problem well problem\nIt's an executive order I'd agree with them [laughter] so you're okay with it yeah whatever [laughter] it was not the justification yeah that is a justification I think what would happen\nIs it would be challenged and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally okay for the Supreme Court to rule on that the fourteenth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens\nOut what it's about no this was clearly again I said yesterday everything after the tenth amendment basically is a read a ration\nIs just to reiterate or did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to\nPay that right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees okay and then I'll stop it yeah here the you literally Democrats knock it off ... yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and\nHaving a baby and then you know as sneaking in cross having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here\nLudicrous that what that was ... and so it's an interpreter now all this time right but you can't you can't do it with an executive no but\nIf he's doing with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court I\nKind of okay with that yeah and that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just because I\nConstitutionally I think no the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it will be entirely there is yeah I think it would be interesting to see how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts so he needs to the judges he's put in\nNow rule on this than with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not it was going to be fascinating to get out and it does happen imagine\nChuck Schumer and uh and Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh\nWe really believe this\nThat guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh really I mean\nYou can usually come with the Pittsburgh shooter and we say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes oh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership trying to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play can we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this so far they have gone so far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\n... um [noise]\nYou know in a week people\nGet to make a decision is is the America they want to live in because right now the only constitutional check against this sort of a porn behavior I get that guy really a guy who was sending a message\nBy time and time again tweeting about face forward talking about is bad hair day there that was done intentionally [laughter] send a message\nTo white nationalist\nSays about me that much\nBut I'm I'm going to watch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nI'm just not that I'm I'm not going to let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become you know it's a twisted they well and that's from a hard core conservative yeah she got her own nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know not not at least not at\nAnd he laid out all the reasons why it's about to take off yeah\nHe was going to yeah right yeah not again it's just a matter of timing I'm All right so here's what I Want you to do I want you to take the smart crypto course because I think everybody should have at least a hundred dollars in in crypto currency it's just this game changing stuff\nAnd between a bitch coin you know crypto currency and block Jane\nThat is the future and you need to understand it takes is Glenn Beck exclusive\nCourse right now smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or coal eight seven seven ... back eight seven seven ... smart crypto course dot com [noise]\nWhether those news talk on line meant five Ninety JAGS Jane Donnie ...

President Trump is threatening to sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship\nTerm told accents on HBO he plans to end citizenship for babies born to moms who are us citizens including illegal immigrants\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order but\nMichael Wildes the immigration lawyer who helped Milan your trunk when citizenship test\nDoes not have the legal authority to do this it as well civil war ends of the fourteenth amendment\n... ending birthright citizenship would be unconstitutional\nFairly Catholic reporting from New York general services well began today for the first have eleven that Tim said the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting president trampled visit Pittsburgh today to honor the victims of Saturday's shooting massacre and gun\nAround with taking legal action against President Trump for using hit hit some happy at a political rally hours after the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh Pentagon\n\nAmerican I'm Damian than a Fox News that's what President Trump believes considering an executive order to undo the policy any baby born here whether the mothers in the country illegally are not as a U.S citizen he tells actually goes on HBO\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her\nAnd so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do you think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and in in the entire me too movement had a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um ... it basically she was you know print brave in doing that um I think you know from a career wise it might've been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet here's a woman in the me too moment exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in a way that it was a given birth to\nA man I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of her because of that um so yeah I think that's what happened and egg and\nPatrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red build America you can hear it on the uh I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues that I Want to kind of go through\nA a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and clothing ... Smith are saying there's nothing to worry about this isn't an invasion\nWhat what are your thoughts on the care of them [noise]\nYou know I think that it is something that for whatever reason the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on 'em in regards to our borders are open borders I I I feel like it is a we actually do an episode\nThat's coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do\nAnd we follow a to construction workers that um I I don't want to give the you know the end away but they've completely this prove that ah that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about\nThat have lost their jobs to to a much cheaper labor that comes across the border and\nI think that we're seeing this year I think that this caravan it is just not for political refugee status these people are looking for its economic and it's going to hurt the most vulnerable people in the United states\nWell I think it's what's causing the homeless crisis in in Los Angeles is that fueled by any of this\nYou know that's a funny thing that you you asked that that it does um one hundred percent fuel out of that because a lot of these kinds of labor type jobs have been taken away um but another thing that is causing the the homeless crisis and you in Los Angeles\nIs is that there is is the drug epidemic there are there's a thing called patient and we actually have a story coming out on that\nI'm patient brokering where people are using Obamacare to fly to fly people out to Los Angeles to rehab centers\nThen when they end up using men\nAre using the the health insurance or they end up getting stuck here in Los Angeles and there's been this huge surge of of ... basically a rehab tourism\nHere in the in the Southern California area that has been a that is it being attributed to the homeless surge of course last you know basically follows the the passing of Obamacare and I've spoken to parents that have basically been through this and they went directly to Obamacare as being part of the reason why uh their kids have gotten\nOut here in Los Angeles and then get end up getting stuck out here\n[noise] um you're covering also one other story I went to a cover with you why does the black community vote almost unanimously for Democrats\n[noise] you know we are that we were releasing two episodes on Thursday so um our podcast as launching this Thursday and I are radios a podcast or to me I Am and one of the episodes is on this question\nAnd we speak to Kansas Owens and diamond in silk and we get there at opinion on on why I'm the black community as vote voted on almost unanimously since at least the nineties or the eighties and what we're told is is that they've been condition their entire life to vote that way\nAnd um they use the tool of racism and and the and the and the big claim of racism to kind of scare people and and ... there's no other community within the United states than boats Ninety percent plus for one party\nI'm a I Am I I just I I I'm having a very difficult time uh today and I I I\nI guess it's just time to turn it all off and and I mean just today is the day really for me that I'm like okay I don't have anything in common\nWith the mainstream media Adel ... uh meet the press ought to be on last weekend and I said no\nAnd they said why you know you have so much to say we are yeah yeah what you say that to every ... you know and the reason why is I don't think\nGoing on expecting to have a conversation and with an actual solution is anything more than insanity at this point how many times we've done this or any of these shows giving us any answers or any of them\nKnow they've got one guy saying one thing and then the following the other guy say in the other and you're left in the same place and most of them have an agenda I mean going on CNN now it's crazy that's crazy I don't know honestly who's watching CNN it's craziness\nBlaming blaming Donald Trump for Pittsburgh and then Linda sar soar\nTo ... you know tweets out we're turning our grief into

don't care or support assault weapons ban fifty eight percent say yes thirty nine percent say no\nI mean that's again the salt weapon's ban is a tough it's a tough a\nSummary of what it actually is because it was only the males matter and people don't know I think it's a scary guns but I mean that's not a typical that poll for an independent\nI think this one is really interesting 'cause there's two questions support the rights of kneeling NFL players fifty seven percent of independents say yes thirty nine percent saying no\nHowever there's also this question support the actions of kneeling NFL players thirty nine percent say yes and fifty five percent\nSay no so people support their right to do it but don't agree with what they're doing exactly right now that it's not the way the media is portraying dope 'em and I think it's the way most conservatives feel right like yeah I guess they can do it but it's not that I mean that's not the right way I don't support what they're saying and what their what their actions are correct\nOr support single payer healthcare fifty six percent say yes thirty seven percent say no\nAnd that if you're wondering why you're getting so many people jumping on that bandwagon at the polls like that that's why the Democrats are doing it\nDo you want Congress to check Trump fifty three percent say yes thirty eight percent say no\nAlso by the way the founders said yes to that one yeah and that has to any president\nRight that that should be part of the role that should be a hundred ... one hundred percent um do you support them lower investigation fifty two percent say yes forty two percent say no these are independent voters compare that with another poll yes he's\nOf a real crisis on our border\nPlus what's happening to the economy\nWe ...\nWe are we should all hold our breath and not do anything to add to the chaos\nBut the time is coming where we're gonna have to pay for the mistakes of the past and when it does I recommend that

left\nAt the time he said this details were scarce but things were looking you know like it was going to get really bad I said just go take care of your family if you need anything call me a mercury

I mean 'cause I saw lots of tea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the laws the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because their votes were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight on the ground and remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children\nYou know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of wanting them in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and a was a John Lewis marched out\nIn to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't do you remember\nThey tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and\nBrett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington DC you would not have been pretty it would not have been\nPretty and by the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob there like charging cities and they're taking over that's ... that's a riot\nThat is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people\nEspecially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violent\nOkay and and the quote is\nA mob of protesters that their usage\nSo is this not a disorderly crowd of people that are trying to what we've done a ... percent on causing truck in tenth on causing trouble\nI mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not tell us in trouble I mean if you're going to go down that road I guess we are in that that doesn't does it say there and\nUnless you're right just as intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though is that the media does not the\nHarassing conservatives that's causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a parade feed it that's like the you know there it's basically a you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things but uh yeah I mean they say I [laughter] the Irish guy who runs\nThis all ... [laughter] let me tell you I mean the white people if they do it was a white people really do ya [laughter] really bad oh really [laughter] okay so let's listen to a couple of things\nFirst we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob yes I'm going to call it a mob a now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is\nProtesters guaranteed to a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change\nThe description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy for what a mob a protest it looks like he\nIs a matter of fact\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech his wife I said things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his rallies he sat knock the crap out of them oh what'd you and seriously okay ... I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers and leftist continue to push\nProtests as again to\nSorry sorry [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nThey go anywhere we see this now here's\nHere's the problem let's wretched things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says\n... I think there's a real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker said get up in their face\nHe he may think that that's okay but what do you have to realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nWhat I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which state's college was nearly killed the guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot [noise] basically has almost killed he was yelling this is for healthcare hit a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and had a my ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion all of that these are people that are unstable and we\nDon't want to encourage them we have to somehow record it down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK ever reason for or a means we're trying to resolve things I feel that there's going to be in a fascination I really worry that someone is going to be killed [noise] and\nUh that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation those who are actually getting getting their face they have to realize that they bear some responsibility of this over to our church\n[noise] so do you remember the time when people like brick Baldwin in CNN were lecturing us that you couldn't say you're going to target a district\nBecause that of course led to violence couldn't target to the district remember the lectures of your words have power because you don't know who's listening to them and we said unless you're unless you're endorsing this we are calling for peaceful rallies\nAnd they were and they were\nThese are not peaceful how many people were arrested from the Tea Party\nRiots mobs\nHow many I don't remember any\nThere's four hundred just last weekend on the left four hundred that's disorderly that's not a peaceful protest your words do have power because

speaker news talk five Ninety KCBS Jay\n\n[noise]\nAnd the ... you know if you look at the the civil unrest in America and you really look at the history you will find that it is almost always the left and in particular the communist or Marxist left\nThat is behind the civil unrest if you look at a you know here's Seventeen eighty three to Seventeen Ninety nine and you know Eighteen twenty nine to Eighteen fifty the riots and and ... that's\nYou know a a paragraph each but after the communist manifesto\nWell then you start to get some interesting riots usually called strikes now some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race but a lot of\nThese come from a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the Klan\nHe shows the first ... a movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the clan\nA clan goes real resurgence and he was heavily involved in it ... to the military and all sorts of things so you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots again\nIn the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen onward will that's because of segregation and all of the things that a progressive\nPlanted alright but let me just go through and see if you can find any\nPatterns here the Patterson silk strike the copper county strike the Indianapolis streetcar strike a the Seattle general strike mayday riots read this summer the Boston police strike the steel strike any of those\nSeems a labor related I was the last labor related doesn't it and labor it who\nI'm Sorry if you look these up almost every time you will find the international workers' of the world\nWho are the international workers' of the world that is of course are based in communism and Mars is it is the communist army here in America the international workers' of the world unite rise up against your oppressors\nYou also had in Nineteen sixteen the preparedness day bombing in San Francisco a you had a um a you had read summer which was about twenty of them you had made a riots\nYou had the ... massacre was what's interesting is the preparedness day bombing\nThat was the left and communist saying you you can't get involved in the war\nBecause it's so unethical and we're going to bomb you until you stop the best way to say that we're icicle is with a bomb bright this trail you a massacre if I'm not mistaken was again the leftists the ... I Can't remember which one it was but it was a communist organization\nThat was against a all of the um all of the American legion Z\nAnd they were coming up so they're they they go and they protest I think it was a parade and they actually end up rioting and killing people okay good\nThen you look in the Nineteen thirties and forties it's\nEssentially it was a an industrial workers of the\nWorld and by ... thank you okay Minneapolis or Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for the auto light strike the west coast long shore strike do even know what that one was that when that happened that may ninth through October twelve\nThat wouldn't shut down San Francisco bay a the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike\nThe battle of the overpass the republic steel strike almost all of these and including many of the race riots have\nCommunist and Marxist fingerprints on them\n\nI said it's it's a fundamental to the ideology right repetition is fundamental to the ideology is not surprising that this was happening again ... I just I'm I'm really tired of\nOf sharing a or I should say it this way I'm really tired of the media and their lives\nBloodshed take it take it take it until they couldn't take it anymore and they then rose the declaration of independence which did not lead with why they were so mad instead they wrote up please me this is who we are\nAnd will stand you just seem to want to fight I Am not with you by look to win\n[noise]\n[laughter] I Want to tell you about pro flowers if you need to send somebody in a sari nuts pro flowers I'm a one eight hundred flowers dot com if you need to send somebody uh flowers you need to apologize to somebody who you\nAnd you you screwed up with your wife for whatever send\nOne eight hundred flowers dot com they have your back send the flowers right now they have a special that is happening right now if you use the promo code or back you're going to get a dozen red roses are multi colored roses for twenty nine Ninety nine but if you use the ... they'll give you another doesn't so two dozen roses\nAbsolutely absolutely free the extra doesn't end the free glass base go there now one eight hundred flowers dot com it's one eight hundred flowers dot com use the promos code back [noise]\nOn the radio on the Web to find ... case she has ... dot com\nOkay you're a busy business person you're trying to hire somebody and\nYou've got a job site that it's just overwhelming you with tons of the wrong resumes that's\nNot smart here's what he is smart zip recruiter dot com slash back unlike other job sites zip recruiter doesn't wait for the candidates to find you it goes out and\nFind them for you zip recruiter dot com slash back has powerful matching technology that scans thousands\nOf resumes identify people with the right skills the right education and experience for your job and then invites them to apply so you get the quality candidates and the qualified people through the door first and you don't have to sort through things because they already do that and they highlight the best people\nIt's no wonder that zip recruiters rated number one by employers in the U.S right now\nYou can try it for free at this exclusive Web address its zip recruiter dot com slash back that zip recruiter dot com slash ... dot com slash back fry it today it's the smartest way to hire\nAnd and this is Sean Hannity morning minute Morgan Stanley\nSaid the belief in American exceptionalism among global investors\nHas never been higher organs daily guy by the name of ...

coming through their\nWeb conditions a little slippery and a few areas be careful\n\nBut not the ultimate price yet\nOn your rent your oven cleaning that random program\nI Want to think and a denser he is um he's a guy that we had books last hour and I\nKind of went in a different direction but I did it fits right in to what we have been talking about today I had a caller uh about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we are going to fight back\nAnd we should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the crew and steady we have to speak truth do not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are\nTrue to be civil and kind to one another but we were not at a place where I think he grabbed the gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage of a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen that before in my lifetime and rage and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time\nBut it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage and I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've gotta walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges Dan's response is I mean they just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel like I Know you are a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage or and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your\nComments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today\nBut it but I but again I I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups\nRather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hartford did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture and our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that we live in two in every generation of space there challenges\nBut this is our moment and in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats we have some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed I think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability\nThat we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around the Samaritan woman at the well\nAnd I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYou fight but you fight or a you know for example you can't war at a people and\nReach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and falls crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\nBut ... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know ah trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... if it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attractive to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life you know I spoke of the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the gold those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them yeah and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life and left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot\nIn Christians in the age of outrageous is to I used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and and and gun for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject I think it matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nImportant we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game for small just ... but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses in Jesus\nWe take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling remodeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type back\nIn just a second first let me tell you about gold lying\nOr President Trump has been a warning about the risks to every American if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress this November we will see an impeachment proceedings that does not mean that they will remove him from office but they will impeach him\nA the ... the the first chance they get if they win the house if they win the house and the Senate you're gonna see gridlock you're going to see nothing really nothing good\nLiterally chained a as slaves\nOr you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you I'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit\nAnd we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and\nSaid we understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about are trying to hold back the advance of course it either pagan\nAnd he says this I'll watch the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in pious galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their about by\nThe name of the book is the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage make it a meat is well worth the read\nGlenn Beck show on one of those news talk five Ninety Casey as

... that's the one thing the left had right\nThey might yeah they might have had it right in the right way right I mean\nThey were the yeah the route of with bad right I think we are today by by the way I remember when they put the flag with all the corporate logos on it and everything else I always thought oh please give it a rest but it is I mean you could put Amazon Google Facebook on the flag and eh pretty accurate\nYeah we ... we ... we now have and those are some that you mention that we now have companies that are big enough to really fit fit that role I don't know that it that they do no not yet but uh Amazon in particular is just getting enormous and I'm In the book the for the hidden DNA of Amazon Apple Facebook and Google\nOr the author talks about just how massive Amazon is a\nFor instance far fewer us households have a gun than Amazon Prime thirty percent of sixty four percent holding a more Americans have primed and voted\nIn twenty sixteen only fifty five percent I'm more Americans have Amazon Prime then go to church a more have Amazon Prime than um than are in a monogamous relationship with a spouse\nShe'll have said that about more Americans had NBC and CBS and ABC I mean\nMaybe but they're into so many other things to which you know you've got to consider\nThat I'm\nA ... that they're they're into\nElse like that I think it's fifty five percent of households now or sixty five percent of households have a Alexa ... and\n... why do we invited that surveillance indoor home if they want to use it that way and I don't know that they are but they are they are recording\nThey are recording the gas yeah recalling it'd be the newly yet because they they it needs to a listen but it's also learning it's trying to learn how to communicate\nYes and they're they're reporting on our moods our tastes all the things we like all the things we want the things we need and our fears and they just report all of that\nBack to a Amazon headquarters or they\nJust gobbled up a whole foods right now and when they did kroger's stock went from thirty one dollars a share to twenty two\nThat's how big this company is wow they're going to be the largest

I mean even for I mean think of this even just for comparison you can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed in our war huh well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer did will have a local copy stored on their computer or their advice\nUm and and this is this a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally many services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own sort of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm for with the Apple TV for example\nThe Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of a movie you have to access it through their\n... servers exactly I'm Sorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded if something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\n... so\nThat allows you to store those files locally on your own device\nBut because the Kindle is tethered through soft where right where connections to Amazon Amazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it move those files strong\nIs laughable ... you're talking about or go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years ago two and a very different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forced everybody to have it exactly\nThe bizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou ... it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they're constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk of but a little bit about the change their cars that either but

going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex going which is this\nThis bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it around it has a maximum flexibility you just break off pieces and uh you can have you know one tenth one quarter of an ounce of silver\nBut they

even now you buy things on line\nSometimes you're not actually buying them you're just renting them you're entering an ongoing relationship\nWhat does this mean for um society how is this going to change us we'll it's even change the way we view things and and change some fundamental or concepts of what it means here in America of individual rights\nWearing a ... on with is professor of law and I'm\nThe author of the book what we buy when we buy now and you can find more information at the end of ownership dotcom\nEra and so tell me what how you've been looking at this\nSo I think in the short term we're likely to see more changes in the way our commercial interactions occur in the way that\nCommercial transactions are structured rules were going to start to see people become more and more accustomed to paying for temporary access to resources rather than owning them and in some ways\nI I think that makes some degree of sense there are some people for whom owning a car is it necessary they'd rather be able to take a left or use some sort of car share application and I think\nThat makes a lot of sense what I'm worried about is the long term a set of implications for a shift away from ownership and towards temporary access a shift away from independent control\nOf resources to one where we have to rely on permission or or or the sort of good will of the companies that control access\nSo ... maybe may I give you an example and see if I'm On the right track I buy a car and I love this car and I want to keep it and it's a classic car but\nI don't own the software that runs the car and if any time the software company says no I'm not going to and we're not going to support that or we want to discontinue or whatever\nI I um I Do I have a heap of junk I Can't do anything with it because I don't own the software that runs it\nI think the cars a great example um we see this issue come up and the motor vehicle contacts or the ... the way it come up um [noise] uh most most recently and most often is actually not with cars but with tractors or John Deere\nUm the long a run in American foreign equipment company makes exactly this argument that they own the software in the tractors that say they sell to American farmers and that means that farmers can only get their tractors repaired I authorized John Deere a dealers\nThey can't do it themselves they can't go to their local mom and pop or you know farming repair shop [noise] um I think those kinds of changes are really troubling\nBecause they go to this sense of independence in the sense of autonomy that we're all independent actors in the world who can make our own decisions who can decide what's best for us do we want to keep his tractor as it is do we want to modify it do you want to repair it\nThose decisions are being taken away from individual consumers and you're doing force to play by a set of rules dictated by the company to quote unquote settle you these products\nAnd doesn't that also doesn't also stop innovation I mean sometimes the guy who take something and then tinkers with it comes up with a better system but if I'm if I'm locked out of tinkering\nOn my own property uh it it ... it it almost creates this uh this feeling of oh well that's just the way it is and that's the way it always is going to be just runs that way and it stops innovation doesn't it\nI I think it has the real risk of doing that it it discourages people from being creative discourages people from\nUm from as he said seem dream with the same as if they are and we have a lot of ah incredible innovations that have been made a over the centuries in this country that didn't come from giant\n... D departments they came from individuals messing around with things that down in their\nGarage and there is a risk that were for closing those kinds of opportunities\nBut even even more broadly at 'em if we're discouraged and thinking of ourselves as independent actors in the world and I worry that that creates a sort of complacency in\nEvery hour five after some towns and on the maybe the biggest casualty of away from the radio history with your share of over a quarter of a million bucks\nA thousand dollar pay day he's here on the news dot five Ninety Days yes or\nWhere you were daredevils go to\nOur white they get into [noise]\n\nBecause they may qualify for free or low cost health insurance through medicating share\nEven if you apply for your kids could still be eligible for Dr intend to visit prescriptions and\nTake your kids to cover today\nGo to ensure kids now down got a call one eight seven seven kids now\nFor my seventeenth birthday I lost my sister a mom to cancer and then I got a\nThirty weeks of chemotherapy in several surgeries to remove the tumor hair my damaged\nThanks to my children's American network hospital I'm cancer free\nNow studying to become a pediatric oncology nurse and I never did it didn't marathon at my university now my local children's mental\nHealth kids live their dreams\nWhen your money where the miracles aren't\nGiving to your children's miracle network [noise]\nIf you're looking to visit a hall of fame and see the legends of sport you don't have to travel across the country we have one right here in Oklahoma come visit the national wrestling hall of fame in museum in Stillwater, Oklahoma\nTo see the history of the world's\nSports memorabilia champions from all levels and honor east from ... chapters across the country\nMore information visit ...

up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and make money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it and Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that\nIt's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kevin ... and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seeing that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country\nGoogle searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very uh you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's a verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah that's a real problem\nYou're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because it's occurring real time but\nThe bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive if you and I are having a ...\nRaymond about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way of fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus\nAnd and and Hillary arm wrestling probably not going to convince you voted different wet I wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter] but you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias\nYou know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why will you know I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent\nYes and it's not very good\nAt it is not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line the ... dot com Peter ... with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role in from our last

with us a president of government accountability Institute producer of a new documentary that is out you find it at the\nCreepy line dot com um the creepy line and it comes from a a quote from the guy who's running the Google that you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that\n...\n\nProducer of a new documentary that is out and you find it at the creepy line dot com um the creepy line and it comes from a a quote from the guy who's running the Google that you know we do\nBusiness area but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies are are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing going here yeah I I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back and first consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine\nGoogle actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning they blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the ... the scope and size that Google has wait a minute how it is it's it's a sign they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW\nYes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and scope of this company is enormous and a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail and not worried about Gmail that's fine but here's your company ... you know it may be John Smith it acme incorporated dot com\nBut his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example\nRobert apps signed this scholar who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a harbor PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this is back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they hit shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech yet on general or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves\nThey view themselves as a company with a mission so\nHere's what people say when when you know what I use Gmail well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually\nYou are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product yeah we say what his girls product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nYou know there's that this is just at the beginning let me tell you this ... story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing

vindictive and a and to further more ruthless and further the rage\nI'm I'm just looking up you know more ruthless gang gets caught on um [noise] they could shoot flaming arrows oh oh\nI Know uh-huh here hundred pound rocks they could just start slinging one hundred pound rocks at let's say Ted Cruz and his wife\nDinner or okay would take human corpses and they would um burn a mixture of sulfur and petroleum ... and then they would cat a poll that dead bodies so that the boom that's on the table\nOh so you're ... you're throwing your catapult inflaming bodies at this that the people who are just trying to eat dinner ... who voted for Kavanaugh\nThey should never be allowed a moment of peace we know that but what question is what sort of death and destruction shall we rain on them\nOkay okay how about this one or the ... okay so we don't have boats anymore so we don't have to worry about that but what\nThe models would do is they would take the leadership and they would roll them in carpets and then they would trample them with horses\nSo what do you think about just rolling up some of the Democrat or Republican senators and a and then the mobs can just trampled well we don't have horses per se but just cars smart cars smart car so they wouldn't hurt the environment but we would just we just keep driving over those carpets was smart cars\nI ... I mean that sounds pretty I mean where I could hurt the environment with that right well we make sure we use a ... hour ... electric power was only yeah because those things will\nNever harm the environment a flaming arrows a choking their a choking their opponents by having stones shoved down their throat\nOh I like that\nYeah that seems like that you know that if someone votes against\nA a a tax increase I think that's a ...\nRepayment don't you think I mean look there but they're putting extremists\nThe court like capital mhm uh and you know I think a few rocks down their throats would probably be good\nWell they were usually be headed I don't know that seems a little bat seems a little dicey don't you think having a little bit just a little over the ... I don't know seriously where'd you go with\nYou how do you get more ruthless in a in a civilized society and I think that's one way over the line of a civilized society but without actual violence where do you go you don't you only think maybe as murder you accuse the hopes are accusing\nPeople murdered you cannot go more ruthless without violence there already disrupting people in their homes their places of business you know\nTheir their softball practiced oh no they did that was that was violence wasn't it\nYeah and then when the bomb the gun but nobody headings yet\nGlenn Beck show on ... news talk five Ninety Casey is Jay\nFive [noise] so let me uh let me talk to about liberty safe did you see the video yet\nYes I went and saw it after you ... just awesome\nThey put they put five or they put a hundred dollars a nice safe liberty safe and then the competitors safe and then they have a crane with a hundred pound block of concrete more than a thousand a thousand pound block of concrete and do they take it up I don't know how I view stories and then they just let it loose\nAnd its matches the competitor completely flat yeah Utah just ducked um liberty safe as an open it doesn't open it's\nUnbelievable check it out for yourself at liberty safe dot com bust liberty safe dot com or the second half of this month they're reading the Franken the Franken the Franklin Stein\nEvent where the Franklin is one of their best selling events first half of October right now the extreme safes are on sale check it out twelve months interest repayment liberty\nAccording to the department of energy the most expensive utility for most Americans is their electricity bill adding to your financial misery this allergy season has been one of the worst in the years so now is the perfect time to order a new set of age back to the authors from filter by dot com with over six hundred scientists to choose from including custom often\nYou'll find the perfect it ships free within twenty four hours with filtered by dot com they're made in America that filter B.

twenty miles up the coast of Mexico moving toward the Gulf\nHere will form from gaining strength but will encounter a more favorable environment in the Gulf of Mexico which will result in strengthening and possibly reaching hurricane status later on today landfall looks likely across the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday\nSure well we're bombarded as you know by all kinds of information and all kinds of media sources or\nA you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors are always working uh you know even even when they listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are kind of All right and it's out when people are you yeah\nOf course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause I think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what's higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've now done with for national elections involving you know\nI'm more than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate\nYou can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track you that is scary\nIt is you are you lead us out in the in the creepy line\nI'm about how Google has really stripped itself a bowl ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda [noise] um and then ah ... how they have\n... you know the ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where you you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and\nYou got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this and national a study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did have a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen Ninety nine point five percent of people in the study a casino bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism\nUh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs are in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability to shift people\nThinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use ah ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs\nOr around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results that's not like a news story that just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know we'll send in Bernays a in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that this is the this is the system that they would have\nDreamt of for propaganda [laughter]\n[noise] oh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article a called a\nCan of ways big tech can shift millions of both in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation effects are seen as the eye me that's just one of ten ways\nUh that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment\nAh that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nAnd they they they are I mean some of these effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences and they're ... or ... years\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\nWell into thousands sixteen early two thousand sixteen or working in secret uh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people were seeing while they were using\nThe Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system and so it was a first ever created\nAnd so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty late and that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nOr you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them\nAnd uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually be able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world\nAnd will will I think they all to make these companies accountable to the public at some point uh\nYou know I Wish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I Would say that's not going to happen but we will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nA that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which\nMIT trouble [laughter] ...\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm who's ... [laughter] All right\nLet's let's say that are a very good in the good and the good news I mean the the good news is that um\nThat Glenn Beck dot com right yeah and your email service that you use\nA is is you are not sharing information you're sharing your emails with Google Now interesting lapse in New York Times the times of London the economist wired magazine slate I could go on and on and on\nBase share all of their emails all the time with the Google and other sensitive documents too and so reporter is when they're doing\nYou know very sensitive investigations on something they're sharing everything constantly with Google and I wrote a piece about that it was in the Daily Caller a couple of months ago good news is you don't do that\nYou're okay let's end it there for ... [laughter] this is this has been asking that for a second\nIt will come back with the bad news plus ... the the I think he's in ten different ways that Google is influencing us and not just Google but these big tech companies and\nSome of the other things that uh he has found how they are monitoring our children and it is remarkable and we are running out of time in a before Google is the dominant than\nJust can be stopped are sponsored this half hour\nIs gold mine President Trump has been warning about the risk to every American if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress was November and the risks are pretty uh\nPretty dire uh and especially coupled with what the Democrats were saying this weekend there are several stories out this weekend say that they have to become more radical uh ... in their their push back\nWell now the good news is again you you you do not share your emails with Google a lot of major news organizations like the New York times and the Boston Globe they do but it's bad news is\nThat a Glenn Beck dot com uses Google Google Analytics and so what that means that everyone who has ever visited your website is tracked every single thing they do on your website is tracked by Google\nSo here's a here's the problem is a business owner Google Analytics or the best\nNow do you how do you how do you do business without Google at times that's that's always the thing that gets you in\nThe yeah well sure but you know ... you know this is this convenience thing over and over and and the products are so good so but you don't realize that these are real products they're just surveillance platforms that's the only reason they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform\n[laughter] uh I Do have a little bit more good news though which is that film that you mentioned the creepy lie has a when\n... when you had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peter Schweitzer on your show recently though is uh uh he's the one who would who really got that film running a it surely wasn't\nAvailable but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and on I tunes for for rental or sale and it's it and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just goes to the freebie lying dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this ... were you you were blocked by Google for a time where you are not\nWell when I when my research a first hit the news and the Washington Post a you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any Google products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so [laughter] I have these amazing screen shots that they're just shocking\nTo people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah but I have three and shot showing getting these time out saying no no you can't get their sorry\nAmazing okay let's go through some of the\n... some of the uh affects that you were monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there\nWas the last seven ten or ten of these but your\nFollowers ten altogether okay\nOut an altogether okay so let's take on one real quick\nBegin very good when okay here we go this is called\nDeath as the er the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you type\nSo if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestion that you and Amazon it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you\nTo turn a fifty fifty votes among a fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split with all my one having any idea that they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh okay we're gonna come back and uh and go through the others if we have time he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and\nWhat we're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the creepy line\nIt's a new documentary the freebie line dot com the freebie line dot com\n... news talk on the go diehard radio and five Ninety Casey as Jane dot com\n\nCheck out the lens block five Ninety case yesterday dot com word\nGlenn Beck getting around Pueblo this morning north and South Bend I twenty five you are going to see things going to be a little bit more difficult than normal it's put it that way they should make your way out\nAs far as I'm twenty five is it's been a good shape coming down from fountain in Colorado Springs are making the way all the way down past week warm uh nobody problems on fifty or fifty west just floating school zones of slow right now it'd be usual spots I'm ... good morning\nIf the Klan that probably\nRobert Lipsyte he's a senior research psychologist American Institute for behavioral research and technology he is I'm In a new documentary called the creepy line we talked about last week I saw\nLast week and it is indeed very creepy it is\nUm it's it's is it too much to say it's\nMore on the ... we're apt mind control or the threshold of mind control doctor\n[noise] [noise] ah well we've been here for a long time so there's a you know uh there's no question about it there's they're literally right now more than two point five billion people soon to be over four billion\nA whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected\nA dramatically uh every single day by a some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I just I I Want to reset that you did a study during the last presidential election\nYou are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were\nTrying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's only one way we then have the surge suggestion effect now target messaging affect\nWhat is the target ...\nSure targeted messaging T Emmy we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing affect a is really scary ah this this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to\nBut if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November two thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders\nUh mainly just supporters of Hillary Clinton\nOr exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that wasn't even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day an additional\nFour hundred and fifty thousand boats now gosh I I don't I\nI don't think he did that because you know he was very over confident or you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not I'm I'm a I'm a moderate in and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so\nI'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts votes and think about it no one knows if if something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't that what targeted advertising is\nAll about but it said targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something that's not competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive so\nCan I mean this is so dangerous\nUm and it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has envision forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] Oh yes they can they in fact they know who's an unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it\nI mean ... I mean on the table mentally yeah yeah yeah\nOh no you're absolutely right they have literally unprecedented power or to ... ... is shifts to people yes shift unstable people's shift anybody\nUh and and they know they have this power\nUh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their eight minute film called the selfish ledger you want to get creep out [laughter] botched that film that's an internal film there were there they're talking about their power to reshape human kind\nWith everything that is going on please the best thing to do is to prepare now for a natural disaster or some sort of an emergency situation ask yourself right now did you feed yourself and your family for two weeks with the food that you have at home right now\nIt's time to act and secure in emergency food supply I use my patriots apply and I recommend you do to a two week food kid will get you started this week it's on sale for only Seventy five dollars when you go to my special website prepare with Glenn dot com or called eight hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three\nWho did includes meals at last up to twenty five years in storage order now eight hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three or prepare with Glenn dot com [noise]\nOne of the Lewis news talk online at five Ninety JAGS Jane dot com [noise]\nHi Michelle milk and hear the gods now movie opens on October twelfth dean Cain and the entire cast was her job bringing this to during the big screen\nHow the woman goes into a funny comes on that and there's no police report you might be very\nDifferent movies too scary it's not as a mother of two I promise you can bring your teenage children to bring friends and family kids we have a unique opportunity to change hearts and minds about abortion don't miss out\nCormac God's Neal is perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history God's know rated PG Thirteen\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's\nPremier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rate stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only about on certain three year fixed rate loan Scott across information in conditions equal housing liquor licensing office ... states animal is number three thirty additional conditions exclusion may play\nDuring college former NFL Super Bowl champion signed the most important contractor for his life to serve in the Army National guard\nAround a lot of military my family as far as one of my family for a long time I want to go on or make a difference I didn't find that working behind the desk so for me [laughter] and then they offered to survive\nFor my country was just like to learn how to be part of the Army National guard logged on to the national guard dot com sponsored by the Colorado Army National guard here by the Colorado broadcasters association at this station\nThat\nI have dealt with some frightening things before but I think that was the most frightening our I've I've ever spent on the radio I I I'm not speechless and I think I was speechless twice\nIn that interview 'em I mean just a quick thing they talked about with a fifty fifty proposition being able to be changed to Ninety ten proposition just by suggestion by ...

someday it's going to be that you won't believe your eyes because they'll be able to create a video of anybody doing anything and you won't be able to believe your eyes\nWhile we're there I've been talking about the coming of AI why did last hour why did that affect you so much\nUm couple of things uh one I think like we all there's a lot of people who claim that that these big tech companies and stuff have biases and I think that\nThere's some evidence that they do um you know but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they made ... like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true in a lot of these um you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter\nWould do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really\nA major thing this is a ... you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks they bone in all this is like a lot as a leader\nIn in in psychology yeah it's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research\nCenters it's Harvard I mean this guy is near the real deal with some real credibility again comes the sun is that hard on the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to se discrepancy Hillary as voter\nRight right um but beyond that uh I seems incredibly hopeless to me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time how do we move how do we how do we convince people how to persuade people to look at the world and a slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you\nKnow someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right ah and we talk about that stuff all the time but I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily because I just do it right it but it's harder\nTo make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to on my wind myself from Google\nI honestly have no idea how I Would do that and I'm In I'm not even use an Android me so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go a Google device yeah not\nUse them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance\nApparatus only\nYeah ... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know and one of the reasons they do\nIs it's the best what right like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's\nThe best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right um you know uh the

I Do like the old uh you know ... take the leadership roles women carpets and then just have horses trample them but that might hurt a horse you know in the left would not want to do that you know you I guess you could get a smart car or you know a Chevy\nVolt but then ... set on fire and then you'd die screaming or could be a win win there anyway um oh my gosh did you just threaten\nYeah what are we talking about here how do you turn this up pat how do you turn this up without violence\nBut I think the only ... level up is revolution isn't it that's about the only thing they haven't done so far there screaming and people's faces a they're showing up at restaurants in department stores and everywhere Maxine Waters told him to homes their clawing at the door of the U.S Supreme Court it's\nThey're threatening online yeah they're they're scaring people they're charging them with with crimes they didn't commit I mean I think we're all pretty sure he's not a gamer gang rape is right we're all pretty sure I don't even ... yeah I mean you know there were five\nPeople five people only one charge was Ford Ford was one the other for ... they weren't real\nDo we say well no woman would do that well I Know you've got four people over here who did ... multiple\nHuge stories of fake accusations of sexual assault that have happened over the past few months so this happens all the time because women are people right we're going to people in there and they do bad things just like men do bad things\nBig story ah I think it was in California of a high school kid who was accused by these high school girls they called them demean girls ... yeah it was in the same city where are the movie supposedly took place\nUm and so these girls all got together because they didn't like this guy and decided to accuse him of sexual assault he went through all kinds of hell over it\nAnd uh after six months or a year they finally admitted nano we made that up why\nBecause we didn't like to listen to him and I like to look at him\n... oh Mm wow amazing so did you hear the credible stuff did you hear make them scared the website make them scared\nNon does he was from the University of Washington\nA and a a\nIt's a website where you can just um you know put your allegation out about how you been raped or whatever you just include that person's name you know where they are what class cetera et cetera and just we're gonna make I'm scared\nWow yeah my university students on the university Washington campus\nUh I mean what what else what else\nI mean this is the world the left is is increasingly embracing mhm legitimizing and calling for\n... and what are the the normal civilized way to escalate a situation when you're not getting what you want right you can do things like you could escalate your language was hard to escalate past gang rape accusations it's kinda hard to go past that with your language I guess you can go to murder and go to genocide as a couple of other things I guess you could accuse U.S Supreme court justice up to get your way\nUh then you have a like a they already they already say the United states is a genocidal carry I mean there's there's no way you can increase the language against America were men so then you can go to structural or procedural type of things but I mean look what they did here they they pulled out every stop they tried to get\nA they'd delayed until late and delayed they tried to get an FBI investigation then they said that wasn't enough then we're seven at the effort he's at seven FBI back riding with no\nEvidence that not all of these zero thousands and thousands of people show up screaming we believe we we believe the survivor well\nSurvivor what why I mean until it's confirmed she's not a survivor right like I mean at least to us she made if something happened to her and she's telling the truth like having a yes she's a survivor to herself but as a society we have to judge it based on the facts\nRight and I own condemn her I don't wish ill towards her nothing nothing I don't know I wasn't there no but we don't destroy either life there's\nGot to be some evidence against the guy it's not up to him to

on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court thanks for all the wonderful a room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWhat but what it does say when it does is it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his\nAnger when he was drinking and this shows the he's capable of doing these things\nSo if I Know what I'm saying even reached further I Know if he would have come on and he would not have been angry\nI would've thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without\nMe at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like the anger\nI Want you to hear me clearly\nI did not have sexual relations with that ... thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful as\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts now here is here's my levy to Donald Trump\nFirst of all\nI don't believe any other president in my lifetime with an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would have done it\nNo other president in my lifetime would have stuck stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings\nThere's no way they would have said the cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey points for Donald Trump for having us fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship doom not move because if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot give any ground\nWith that being said and\nI don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIf those those charges turned out to be right you noticed you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony\nThey're no longer on that yeah nobody in my ... she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so there there there's nothing new there there is nothing new or the press would be saying well you you watch what's going to come out and this FBI that they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening what\nIs happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury\nYou watch that's by the end of the week that's what they will be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump the only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\n\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press conference\nThat you say you know he he\nYou know quit or vote went downhill went down in ... ran down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the only in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely because you don't\nNeed how long did they do take to do to the ... sessions of ah\nAh I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February eighty was the ... went down so let it for weeks and three or four weeks three that we could have probably could have a fast rate other things going on\nCase so you have four weeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks the one who can get that the the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely\nAlready been done he's the only under get done quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done\nAnd quickly or another senator but Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list ts so so you've got you've got Michaeline you could select Tim let's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow which I wouldn't strange\nAccident but it could happen and it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy with their fighting on the ... yeah I was trying to run if that happens to Kevin\nWell this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane there'll be delivering a the New York times uh plane but anyway so let's just say\nAnd it makes them into sausage\n... uh you need to announce that\nMike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is\n... pro life uh and he would vote\nFor him in the bottom line if he cares about the constitution let anything I

I mean and I go to a yeah a\nDavid before we go into your book here to build and just get give me a minute on your take on Kavanaugh and what's going to happen\nI think he's going to get through and I think um I think this is one of the ugliest smears we've seen and at least in my life ... covering politics and thinking about politics and I think it's gonna backfire and that it's really brought together\nNever most of the never Trump ... and all this sort of disparate parts of the right and rightly so and um [noise] and if not I I was listening to before I think the Trump has to be ready for that and they have to push through someone else because the courts especially when you have a divided\nPolitical environmental as you do today the ... the Supreme Court's incredibly important and uh you know his ... there was a rifle seat there for the for for the conservative and the Trump should do it it has to do to get through\nWhat do you think about what do you think about Mike Lee as everyone knows him you don't need the FBI you could vote in a week\n[laughter] [laughter] I Love the idea I mean and you know he is not going to like wander off\nYou know hard core or so and then I have a okay so let's talk about let's talk about your book the thing I like about your book is that you do not a shy away from America's gun culture\n[noise] yeah I think we talk a lot about the politics of gun out of his guns and obviously it's important the ideology behind it but I think a lot of people miss the culture behind it the hundreds of years of of of imbedded culture not just not just in war but in in commerce\nAnnie and in just the individual lives of Americans and how important it was and how that is in our DNA and that's why we talk about guns the way we do so because I grew up in New York and [noise] country sort of alien to my\nYou know neighborhood and place I grew up in West criminals had them or I thought it was important to try to figure out what that was about and ah you know that's what the books about\nWow so so how did you I mean what did you find I I didn't know that you were you know ... is not part of the gun culture I grew up in the gun culture if you will my grandfather my uncles we you know they'd go\nHunting and fishing and we always had guns around a and it takes on a different meaning to me and to people who grew up around them what did you find\nRight I mean you know where I grew up every you know if you mentioned guns or someone had a gun that immediately think about it in a negative way not something that would be positive so [noise] uh you know just a personal story my my dad a little jewelry store in New York and it was a robbed and uh right after that my dad tried to get a gun and it was a ... ...\nYou know just painstaking process of trying to get went to protect your own property and your own work and your own family so that's I think when I started turning\nTowards you know they're having a curiosity about what it was about and then when I moved to Denver lived in Colorado and other places I saw what it was really about and um and how people treated it and how like an end are a member of the most responsible person on her\nYou know when it comes to gun so uh yeah and I don't know if that people\nKnow they don't have that they don't understand that at all hum it take me through some of the stories that you you talk about because I Would I like about this this is not a gun is not a book about um you know necessarily the laws and everything else this is a story\nAbout America and how we we do ... I mean we're unlike any other nation on earth when it comes to guns in our history take me through like a either Sam colder or buffalo bill who am I ...\n... ... one of the most amazing Americans that ever lived I mean not only was he an engineer and and just created this incredible innovation where\nA person one from firing one you know must get shot once a minute or maybe twice a minute to shooting five times in mere seconds he was also just an innovator in in in marketing in selling himself in\nEvery hour five after Saddam Saddam was maybe the biggest casualty of away from the radio

talk to you and maybe we'll do this or on Thursday um anybody who has read the book and wants to ah talk about it I Would love to talk to you about it\nAnd hear your thoughts where I might have missed it where what you may not understood um you know what what do you think is crazy or what is good\nIf you've read the book addicted outrage can we put this on for Thursday I'd like to hear from you Thursday on radio and we'll take calls on Thursday ... a ... just about the book\nYou know given people enough time to actually read it yeah which is nice yeah I think he wanted to do this like the day after it came I did not everybody reads that fast so [laughter] so it's been out for a week\nNow and if you've read it or let's talk about it on because there's a there's a ton a ton in there\nI I think it explains so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with the ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're in you're just playing team a lot of people would just be like the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this capital thing yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime in in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime\nAnd that sort of jump is not it's not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade there is a different part of it is it's about throwing the entire um the tire efforts of logic off base it's based in\nToast modernism huh it's explained in the book and in the times I look at it sound like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things that that didn't make any sense and it's easy political explanations for all that but it's not real the real basics of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example\nMaybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories in the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah uh you can find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nThey're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy and the patriarchy and to collapse the system that we have\nYeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life ... you see them acting or radically and there's some reason and you don't understand why would they do this they blow their job why they did is they blew their marriage all those things why would elect act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it\nYeah it is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight to the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted to outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with you so if you're reading and try to finish it by a by Thursday if you haven't started yet please do um and ah and then joined us on a during his on Thursday\n[noise] okay [noise] um we've we've dealt with the the Kavanaugh scenario uh\nAnd it is that we're in an interesting place it's going to come down to whether the press\nAnd whether the Democrats tend can Vince enough Republicans not even about Ford I

October nicotine ... [noise] and going back program and\nWe need to have a power about Elizabeth Warren to now shall we need to make that a oatmeal do that she made in Palau town don't know whether we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing\nBecause this is this is just outrageous don't you think\nYeah she released this big ... basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper NATO she was a she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware\nYes a which is a is something that does not seem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee\nAnd then they revise that you won ... ... the media revise they can they actually looked at the report and says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and ... then they realized hoops you do see we made a a math there this is a serious correction they didn't say what you do see in the corruption but they pay they should have a cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one\nUh one sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in and of itself so he kept the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those pieces would have a little bit of\nCherokee now this theoretically right could at least give her a technical\nDefense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and thing she's a you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her stupid super recipes and pow al ... which is the goal of almost everybody\nHow how how come out child and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's what I'm going all ... I'm going all full I I've just I'm gonna I'm just\nBut let's all complain about the names of out ball teams but ... I don't want to hear how wild out already or from here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans since it's a tribe to trial it does\nThe I mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to ... ... they\nJust didn't show any DNA from an actual Native American yeah what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA study so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against\nWe have to use people from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well\nWay and there's the the theory is that they those the same people want it migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she has Native American blood that it's not even what they tested\nA and even that it's it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you\nIf you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed in like to point out over the years he would not show the his Canadian blood\nRight like that's not the way this works they said oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian DNA does is it shows the lineage of game shows it it can be interesting in some way show migration patterns and I wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic than a\nProminent friends disorder or it's true it probably would show that uh but so it's\nInteresting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and\nFalling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um it was her great great great great grandmother I think\nA several generations back and um when she register it was in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white now the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and and this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing\nYeah I was like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right you and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with ... her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but what have we learned from progressive we've\nLearned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white and now or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she is not\nThat was what I was not allowed to\nApply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to accept that she is\nSo we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter\nI mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just play looking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those you have to get them you know we've got to start making them or I Want one more than life itself okay so\nYou know where I'm coming from however you know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather actually took\nA horse or be a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet and he talked to him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else but and he took him and he\nPunched him in the head and knock the horse out okay so ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or\nWas this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept a jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this\nAnd he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true\nI got to go in and say it's not my family you don't\nKnow [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing you oh yeah this is what it was but it was the was it was not\nTrue how many advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls\nAnd I was her I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told Dexter you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never you you've\nCares nobody cares if she is nobody cares if she isn't\nI mean what difference does it make and so ... by playing into it she's just\nMaking it about identity politics more and more and nobody cares no people are done with identity politics I'm telling you they're done with it\nAnd the the the first candidate and well we already know the first candidate was Donald Trump said I don't care I don't care I don't care what you say about me I don't care what you accuse me of I don't care that's why he won\nBecause heat that's white twenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump and you'll never hear this from mainstream media because they don't they don't the Democrats don't walk this known\nTwenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump voted for Barack Obama at least once many twice\nSo they came over from the Democratic side\nThey're sick of it they're sick of it\nNow they may not like his extreme tweets and everything else\nBut they definitely don't like the idea that yeah we're going to get rid of capitalism because it's an old outdated idea yeah you know we think we should shut down free speech oh I hate those cops they're all murderers\nMan boy man or troubles especially white man did you know that I'm Indian and that's really great I shouldn't have said India and it really should be Native American because India\nShut up\nCares with all of this stuff that is going on in the world\nShut up the issue here is\nYou don't win that twenty twenty primary with twenty or thirty candidates in it without appealing to those activist who do believe all that craziness\nSo and they're they're so they're ... they're hardcore incentivize Riley when those people over early which is why they're all coming out and you know why the the Spartacus moment happened is white Kamala Harris was so crazy during the Kavanaugh saying it's white ... on TV with you know with the crazy a crazy stunts every day\nBut she does do how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to you'd have to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate you're not going to be able to moderate but those people how do you moderate how do you go over\nTo the side of anti ... and say hey I don't think anybody thing is wrong with that divide shout your abortion and then when you get the nomination\nComeback close enough to the center to where people are going oh she didn't really mean to shout the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean and cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nHere\nYou've been eaten you've been eaten\nBy the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news they may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not about shouting their

immediately\nUh came in and he started taking over the media and and uh nationalizing everything is ... is there a ...\n... is that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him that is the military and is it when you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect him most analysts are don't see any mediate\nA risk to democracy as hey we'll take office and immediately\nHe will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time what is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change in constitution\nAnd it is not clear how he would do it he has suggested that he could create a council that would create a new constitution for Brazil\nAnd that would be submitted to a vote or after eight so and in ... to to people to add actors in general so it\nHe had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back when he takes office because the fact\nIs that he's not going to debate he uh is giving a\nJust a few interviews and usually he ... the process has been speaking mainly through social media\nSo he has no conversation from the press and this ah creates a an unknown territory we don't know what's coming but\nA analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time\nIncluding because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a performance in eh from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governance ... he and he will be able to do\nSome of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly what\nWhat are those changes come it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\nOr that ... son it ... and he posted on line a while back a photo of him I'm next to Dan in and said that Bannon as said he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this\nAt this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and was responsible in a great part of a sudden out of strategy but a ... a lot of himself a case of public afterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it what do we know for a fact\nIs that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ... an expression of\nThis right wing movement that with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's\nA it's a clear wave in this\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there is a picture of him close to the president's at presidential candidates an\nA and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow that we don't know exactly at what point\nAre Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAre now at the end of the month a ... on Sunday twenty eighth\nOr will have the final result it's very likely dead\nConsidering the current polls that bill so not a we'll be elected uh we uh yesterday we had a recent poll that gave also NATO fifty nine percent of valid votes and ... that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one\nSo it's a big ... and I'm both an idle AP Poll after poll has indicated that uh his delight there's our ferry sure of their votes so we we would have to have a new fact something that would be strong enough to change the scenario but\nAnd it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and to find out uh some more we'll be following okay thank you so much ... appreciate okay thank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history a he has\nA he has a very very strong history of um of dictatorship a love and passion and ah he is not\nA Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's changed demand\nA you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator you know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in\nBrazil the other thing that is really should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is a helping cobbled together this um populist movement and\nPopulism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames and uh what are they what ... what's you know what to someone use populism to get through populism is\nThe Patriot act make it so it sounds populist make it so it sounds popular make it so it sounds like something everybody will want that's populism and you can use that for good or evil and I'm In my opinion Bannon is\nOn the dark side of this one and he is definitely someone to keep your eye on and so we're all the candidates that he chooses and chooses to engage with um because I'm In the rest of the world\nThe the believe it or not softness and a tempered Donald Trump doesn't necessarily exist\nAre sponsored this half hour is simply safe simply safe is the way to guard your home to watch over you and your family and it's the craftsmanship\nThe craftsmanship that actually helps um a simply safe beat out all of the other competitors and it makes it all worth it when you when you see simply safe\nAnd you see the price of it and then you see the quality of some simply safe and then you see the quality a and the lack of craftsmanship and more importantly how much you've been paying for the other system it'll blow you away\nAnd so right now you have people saying yeah ours is gone we're just we're not going to sell them the arms more got slapped sanctions on they admit this is horrible and it is it is and that's probably what America should do\nHowever let me play devil's advocate oil is already up at eighty\nSome some ah oil is headed up to a hundred dollars a barrel we've pretty much shut down the Texas oil reserves were I mean we're slowing them down because of the price of oil they couldn't make enough money so they kind of slow them down and we have to open those things back up again which we can do\nBut we're not held hostage by oil but a spike as severe as spike a hundred twenty hundred and forty dollars a barrel that's what collapsed us last time in two thousand eight was a spike to a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty dollars a barrel you also have turkey\nThis is coming from turkey and ... um turkey is no fan of Saudi Arabia um the balance of power with turkey is a little frightening\nEconomically the Saudi royal uh funds are\nBig in Silicon valley and that's why one of the reasons why our stock market is taking a hit at least in the tech sector\nBecause they think if this goes the wrong way than the the ... the the funding is not going to come from Saudi Arabia anymore and you know where they're going to go to get it now obviously there is other places for them to get money for the tech industry but it was easy money\nOr from the Saudis it was easy to get they had plenty of it they were looking to invest it and when you lose a huge source of funding like that that you know can hurt the industry\nYou also have Saudi Arabia being the massive check\nOn um uh on Iran if they are weakened if uh they are a weekend in the area not only with Iran but also the Muslim Brotherhood that's a significant force in our favor in that\nI mean Saudi Arabia has remained the least bad option in the region for a while to Israel Israel Israel and Jordan there's others that are that I Would say are better options but would that amount of\nPower us and uh you know ... again credibility in the Arab world obviously Israel doesn't necessarily have that um but you know Saudi Arabia you know is a is the big\nA sort of backstop right so what do we do they can stop the worst of the things that are as an ear presidents presidents do\nWhat do you do today I uh [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAh resigned [laughter] I Know ah I I think um you have to figure first of all we need I Would certainly the first thing I Would do is have more information that I currently do [laughter] um so I think you're over\nThere with the king and the king says she's screw up total screw up this guy who they were out of control you know I wanted and brought over here they got out of control they started torturing him for answers he died\nAnd then they just chopped them up put them in a suitcase yes all of that stuff is true and I can't believe and these guys they've all they're already dead [laughter]\nOr whatever or you know but yes we did it\n... I mean\nI think you at the very least they're going to do something public right and you're going to do potentially sanctions or something of that nature um you're probably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people are and sending that signal\nA and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then\nI remember there was a world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem\nHere is that uh they believe that he was um you know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against to Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's

bottom alcoholism divorced everything else my life completely falling apart before I really learned that it took a dark chapter in my life\nThat they taught me there is nothing that life can hand you that is in itself bad\nIt just depends on what you do with it\nIs this going to change you in destructive ways\nIs it going to make you angry\nAre you going to be filled with bitterness and despair are you going to be looking for vengeance blame\nOr will you allow whatever calamity has come your way to strengthen you through enlightenment through correction new understandings humility\nIt's up to you\nSo living in interesting times I think that's a blessing\nAnd we're going to learn this one way or another we can either learn this the easy way like with my dad telling me or we'll learn the

they are wrong and we remain right now there are real true right and wrong there there is\nAnd what we face in the end\nIs not going to be smaller than what many of our grandparents or great grandparents faced in the world wars it's not going to be any less frightening than the global economic unrest of the Nineteen thirties but it's not going to be greater either it's just going to be hours\nAnd just like the generations gone by it'll be our choice whether or not we survive\nI think this is a blessing\nThe boomers never got to see who they really were the boomers\nFeast it off the crisis of their parents they never really had to choose for themselves\nLike the greatest generation did life or death freedom or slavery they never had to push themselves as a group beyond what humans thought was even possible to achieve something as valuable or as celestial as freedom\n\nThe crisis that we're now beginning to see is a blessing to blessing our parents never received\nEach of us it's going to have to choose we're gonna have to pick between black and white slavery or freedom good or evil life and death the choices are going to be that clear\n\nWe will all know in the years to come who we really are\nIf we choose carefully who we really are\nOtherwise we will be painfully aware of who we simply allowed ourselves to become\n\nWe can become through this struggle exactly

have we have each of us have doctors and their each prescribing the opposite medicine\nAnd each of us as patients are also desperate to cure or what is killing us killing our society\n\nThat we will follow these doctors directions because they know better they know better they know more than we do that they've got the answer and we become more and more vested in their cure as our friends and family say that's not the cure because we're taking this medicine and we believe we just become\nMore vested in our doctor are doctors write yours is wrong\nNow at the same time the doctor is not going to get more humble because the doctor will know he or she has everything to lose if his or her patients begin to seek another opinion another diagnosis another remedy it's in their best interest to keep patients busy looking at the other side\nSo they're not questioning what he's doing and well we're all fighting\nOver the cure none of us even if stop to ask if the diagnosis is even correct were just too busy fighting what our doctor said\n\nNo I don't know about you but I Know you know we're sick I Know you know this society is sick we are sick and we are in pain and and when I Am sick or in pain I'm usually at my worst inner personally and usually I'm not good at making friends at that point\nI don't think you are either we snap at each other we act as our lesser selves\nBecause when I'm sick I'm I hurt and I am full of despair or I'm fearful\nOr I just don't have the patience and Everytime I'm really sick or in real pain it usually is followed by a time where I have to begin

your program reading out from the paper I wrote previously with Peter ... the ... as a social construct\nAnd I ended up killing one of these hey hey uh to publish open access journals that as apparently fairly low are very low\nUm review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned or was it was definitely fun fun right um yeah he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight [laughter] that um but yeah so what do you learn\nAnd we we took the criticisms we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge\nLike a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people\nContinue to address it a secondly we decided that\nUm we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we hadn't gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been a recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took\nMay be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I know you talk to hell and the other day yeah\nAh so this was in in in the men's amount of work it required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers of typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work there was an insane\nAmount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily\nHaving to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers in striking us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals\nAre for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned the ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know you I Know who you at twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you pulled those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence that I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end are we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we'll we'll go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and an article where they

masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just say this is this an act says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so loaded argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility wants\nTo determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to be in a very privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and leftist fit in that without being comforted and so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claim for example that we grew on too many concepts and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um the the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to reach ... over\nHim interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published what what would that\nMean to the university system would would what does that mean\nAll events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics\nCourses I guess as the best way to say that but also probably into some of the general and stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to using the classroom and this was being submitted to\nPretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society and a direction that benefits us

earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what sign for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy in paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and you get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just you're in trusting your children to\nWho knows what and where is the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be some there is and I think their case would\nBe or at least the case to left would make on their behalf would be a you know things are so bad so\nBad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot worse she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's\nPretty much the opposite like a lot\nTo say that we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who step and walking at the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI've told this story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant pond there in a green area is common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said hey dad I'm just I'm going to walk down to the\nPond like alone [laughter] without your brother [laughter]\nWhat do you stop and think about how you know\nPretty protective ... yeah exactly I I don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey\nWhy don't you walk to Honduras with a group of people that I don't know [laughter] look\nThere are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there in certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations are like this or is there probably are some\nBut it it's just ... you try to get the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of ... everyone is a four year old who came across the border right in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old that this is a different it's a different story a and\nYou just want her first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like this if it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa that's it\nYou know because the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from uh people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish manner ... right and you know like any more thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border\nIt whether you like it or not feels like an invasion right\nIt feels like waiting does there just top like they're they're taught the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right let the overriding the security they they're they're you're coming in or do the right way or the overriding security\nAnd you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course there just because they keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries to deal with this and yet\nOr the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a fairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful\nA war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy\nOf course if somebody sneaks in from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they go and work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then they some and they send back them they'd send back to them if they do it without permissions they send back them ... ... but we can't we're expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to us\nMexico has a pretty stiff immigration law\nA streamline law that insurers foreign visitors and immigrants are in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society they are of economic and social benefit to society way you're you expect your\nImmigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding rights or that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even go can't interfere in their in internal politics plus\nIf they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport I mean that's\nA daily racist right I mean like that is not yet so it's not an argument there\nWe would never know you can't do that you can't do that and know should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans in this present we want to make sure we're still keep Seventy or eighty percent yeah I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't I Can't I Can't think\nOf a warden Trump supporter who would have a ... a support a policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages\nOf white people versus other races you what you want to people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society or going to add\nSomething to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mine bought that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it ... ... security for me but not for me\nAnd that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible [laughter] it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's politically wanting to look at the bottom line is we're we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up\nThat is a completely let the larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to mid term election there's no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah people who have any uh Donald Trump and the people who are supporting the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that saying hey used this use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration because I haven't heard\nAny of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe someone someone somewhere is but it doesn't seem to be a general theme for the party I did hear at all talking\nAbout it in the debate or I don't think I don't know that he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security that mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where I'm at Sally has I think a great chance of winning or people to get because her opponent there is like\nIf you took Michael Moore and put him in his brain into a female body of a congresswoman\nYou would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona oh young it's the lab of democracy she saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truther shows I mean she is\nAs it's incredible but they decided to run her and just thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a one of the first female pilots in history in the air the air force incredibly accomplished yeah had a great chance of winning in a in a tough environment a ... in Arizona adding on this situation where\nAre you know you're you basically have a coat pink worker a code pink staffer is running for Senate in Arizona and it\nWas a huge mistake I think for her to be their number literally with go pick her entire I'm that rising her views I don't know exactly she yeah she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize any early to thousands to the\nPoint where again like she like co hosted a show with someone who's a nine eleven truther Wilder awhile\nThat's like it's crazy bonkers over the line right and and the fact that you have a really solid candidate there in Arizona as the border state the big deal there Texas is another one the cruise cruise has got to lead there but I mean he's always been talking about border security but\nYeah I get a look at the other side of that yet with that though\nHe doesn't want no all he doesn't I I don't know that even wants to border frankly now it just doesn't seem like it and he's made a big deal out of it some of those ads are like let's protect the dreamers\nUm for for his life um\nAnd and from day one in El Paso and and you know this and that gallon if you were born Robert or Albert or Gilbert ... your folks your friends your community calls you bet though that's that's my nickname that I've gone a buyer for my entire life\nI'm born and raised in fourth generation in El Paso I'm In a community that has more than ...

I Hope we can get him back snack nailed down\nUm let's see we got burner burden in Texas Hi\nGood morning I'm having so much fun [noise] ... I have a twin brother named\n... bird as an adult he's calling Robert okay or that\nYou do you do get better okay now what is your background are you ah are you a boring white person or something that would be positive in our society\nWhere Americans of Mexican descent\nTown okay so ... when they need to know what she does know ... ... or I call myself an American an excellent dissent first of all the name\nMy name is bad though but I like to be called burger or get this\n... wow see okay so you're going to the other way you're going from ... to Bobby which is interesting is this kind of ties ideas\nThat name for forty years and ah I don't like to be called Bertha which is that natural inclination from people\n... and I know that they'll personally oh you do I where\nI used to work for the NBA no Paso is the secretary to the director and assistant director when he first started as a came in Congress he's very adamant about helping veterans and we were overjoyed because we needed help getting the message out about the veterans\nMhm [noise] well\nIt was when I came on a lot of my information because I knew what was going on stuff of crafting my desk and everything when I found out that a bad though\nWas running for Senate I knew he had used the veterans as a launching point and they need to them under the bus while we're uh\nTo get his name to get his name nationally known and by the way my call him personally myself I come in horse race [laughter]\nAttractive [laughter] calling Ganguly\nHe's got that I'm wearing Adam's apple and it sticks out for a long time um\nI don't want to seem like an angry Hispanic female mhm I Am just an angry conservative and oh I forgot to tell you I had my best friend and she stayed in Albert she goes embed them but he never agent and bring them in a native\n... and it's like ... and thank you for the call it just seemed like that there is a a a there is an effort made when you when you prioritize identity politics over everything else these things are sensible right like a sensible that Barry Obama both bronco bummer\nRight here in its sensible in that world it sensible if you're Elizabeth Warren to claim you have Native American heritage and in in your school and and submit a recipe the powwow chow like that makes sense in that world because that's all you prioritize it's the only thing that matters right\nIf the only thing that matters is your identity as a victim then classifying yourself or as associated with a victimized population of evil conservatives\nDoes a lot of good for you there is a real incentive and motivation to do it and we keep we seem to see it over and over and over again\nAnd you know look maybe he was called but it was a ... I don't know uh I it's possible I haven't seen a ton of evidence that it's accurate nor that it makes any sense but beyond that ... the idea that he is put on every single sign solely\nBefore letters B. E. T. oh\nThis is not like that might be a nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him ... but if this is not he's not doing it because that the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people especially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point\nI don't know I think everybody knows but it helped him climb to this level\nAnd it's it's the name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname\nThey'll put like Robert Francis and then in parentheses [noise] Beto O'Rourke so you can identify him from you know his campaign Sarah stuff which that kind of makes sense although I I don't even love that all that in my only Beto O'Rourke on the ballot so that I mean the guy has gone to great lengths\nNot to use Robert Francis not to be identified as Irish American now people pressed him on it he's obviously going to admit yeah I'm Irish American it I think I'm from a long line of Irish Americans right but that's not what you get from him when you just watch his uh\nHis campaign ads or you see I'm In a debate he doesn't know he doesn't identify like that at all he's trying to\nBe a Kennedy right he like he wants to be a Kennedy and a plot you know a appeal to the Hispanic community and it's like you're ... you're not be F. K. okay we'll know who the F. K. was he's been gone for a long time [laughter] we all know that you're not the F. K. and just stop trying to BBS ... you're not that he's working on it though\nIt's dry and these these dry and I mean battle is Beto Fitzgerald Kennedy was an incredible\nPerson we'll [laughter]\nAnd it was a tragedy and yeah I mean it really was an amazing a turn of events\nThere and it's good to see it's good to see a that this has gone on I I I just I don't I don't see how people don't see through this you know I and I think maybe on the left\nThey don't want to because they think he has a chance you know every few years\nThe to the left gets that terrible teeth or they get to get close in for in a few polls\nWendy Murphy is going to change Texas who's the mayor refused and that was going to change Texas a oh a were you were to use them and when you were down there yeah yeah sort of a moderate leaning a Democrat he was also going to change Texas\nEvery time they were on somebody there's somebody who's going to just change it and it's going to it no longer we'll have to deal with these darn Republicans down their return the state blue we've won forever and by the way that part of it is true\nAc try to ... generation trying to prove it one one thousand twenty\nYeah that's what made the left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our uh beliefs about you know blood being the determining factor in these things and they they have\nThey have destroyed or over the she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this is this amazing\nAh but the identifying thing there's two parts of that like\nI said as a you know say that you know\nThe libertarian side of me right I don't care what people say they are right like no difference to me she says she's Native American or not I don't care but we are there's an actual truth\nYou know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King wants to come out and say he's black when they're not black ... does that matter to me I don't what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it affects me in any way\nHowever we have to be able to step truth the truth is that Sean King is white but the truth is that racial does all is white and the truth is the Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd you know I that's okay [noise] you know people are supposed to be able to be you know we're not supposed to care so much about these identifying factors but we're in a world in which the left only is the deputy politics the thick world we need to cure it\nGlenn Beck show on Web ... news dog five Ninety Casey is Jay\nShutout blends blog five tiny case yesterday dot

yeah a lot of thought last time you do you have some really put stuff in the dark Web uh so I don't I don't know maybe you'll have to find it there\nAre but we're we're ah we're here about a Beto O'Rourke at Ted Cruz and the Texas Senate battle of people calling in and\nSaying that they knew a lot of people who are white and not named Beto in the communities that he talked about on CNN last night and then there's ...\nIt is is it could be a regional thing I Know there's a lot of differences between north and south I mean people look at you know figures a Abraham Lincoln and better we leave and all these people who are uh you know from the\nDifferent cultures differently from where they are so I think that that's something that we can kind of into as a possible cause for Beddoes a confusion here um\nThere are issues however when you try to appropriate culture\nOr when you reach into some other uh cultural group in and and speak to them sometimes there are issues there was a case it is that the media is like ... is is like liking to highlight today\nA and it just it's a commercial run on behalf of congressmen in Arkansas a French Hill now he had nothing to do with us at all\nAlthough surely CNN Today he will be you know blamed for it ... hours or it's just some unrelated group running ads in support of French ... which is part of our ridiculous campaign finance law situation\nWhere people when they want to donate more money than the the maximum which is completely unconstitutional to have in this country or when people want to do that they give it to super PACs and they run ads on the behalf of the candidate that has no control over those ads so this is a bad ... being run in Arkansas\nIt's up it's related to Brett Kavanaugh and it's being criticized I don't

obviously ... they're making yeah right like the point of and it's a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that\nYou know we one of the biggest reasons Beto is you know in the public eye in the in the United states and not just a Texas figure is because of this video he made about it's ... it's a great I did Neal uh for the national anthem\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin

with\nYou got to see a pattern and have their little been Republican slightly out raising them they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent Democrat in two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent so you get that there's a range there from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken and fifty six was outlier most of the time is right between forty seven fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have raised sixty five percent of the money going to the house wow\nAgain they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came out the other day he raised eight hundred thousand dollars in his district thought he did a good job his opponent and outs two point six million shoes and this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nNow or ... that the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money\nBut if they were to lose this race with these ah with this sort of a climate it would be not complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy elections I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean that was on stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz is influenced by your heart rate made a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world\nUm but I mean he's he's raised this doesn't even clue Beto he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidate my son is in history yeah for a quarter or which is incredible you said it was it compares to ... racing and\nWhat's your what he wants more in the in the uh if you compare quarter last quarter\nOf the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than ... Obama during his presidential\nCampaign that that's a presidential election emphasizing this is the Texas Senate ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win uh-huh\nNow it's funny in the Senate race record he broke\nWas the what was the ... record set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York running a children's Hillary he did not win that race was not a close race even though Rick lousy it wasn't a bad candidate it was kind of a close race\nIt was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win again ear to ear around fifty in almost every it's almost a fifty fifty split every year and this you're sixty five thirty five that's a ...\nAnd the other thing uh it's kind of interesting on the in the bat that if you want to get scare mongering for awhile and why not cleanse out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately um we haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days now and now we\nJust you know we have a\nGoing back in history looking at two hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent only eight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running for Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high\nBut it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency races a little bit more often if you're worried about the Senate as a little bit of there is a little bit of something there to be worried about I\nThink they're going to win the Senate I think you're in a sea of fifty three or fifty four seat majority I think they may pick up a couple of seats oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas\nAre those who were in question ... I I think to winds up winning by maybe ten points or more\nI think it'll be like double digit I think that's a good chance of that um I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten\n... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer to barely comfortable yeah for I think that's where he stands right now yeah Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think a ... you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida in ... Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the top I ended up on ... yeah well I saw it's called but um they pretty much a toss up race but those other I mean Florida is a complete ... reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how to\nAway for junior I mean I'm going to be talking about West Virginia here I think Joe mentioned uh probably sealed his ...\nElection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that as your brand they're all bumped all buck the system when I have to\nI don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you\nComplain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain\nAbout a summer cold Lisa Murkowski Joe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them all of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest\nConservative of all time I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because I'm a craft or now communist again the socialist in communist yeah I mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake\nHere's a guy who's getting flooded so so much by the White House and buy or the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for him for that seat that the seat and Mick Sally is running for\nA well he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah\nBut you know again ... West Virginia is a state it's probably the most pro Trump\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I mentioned got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate or you\nKnow you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capital almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota but I mean in in\nWest Virginia got mentioned he got his cabinet vote you have a couple of it but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls is an interesting development there\nAre but it is a winnable she'll be winnable seat in this environment uh right now mentions leading that won fairly comfortable but even without the mentioned seat you're you're at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one\nIt would be a real surprise if they lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there is a good you know eighty percent chance that there I mean the most models are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota or she's down by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven point a to the Republican Kevin Cramer so yeah that is looking pretty good yeah my pursuit there I think honestly you had two races\nDecided by the cabinet vote one was mentioned Joe ... high camp her vote against that sealed it I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race though\nI don't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it and then she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said the double digits situation happens there yeah look again North Dakota as a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and\nYou know I think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is what we've got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got in a democratic governor we've got a democratic senator and there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances would the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing the same sort of standards you're seeing from Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and all of these far left figures\nAnd good for North Dakota in ... for Jetta sing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah it looks\nThat way yeah yeah there's some uh optimistic things Eric ... the dangers there as well I mean this is this going to be an interesting one and ... and not the thing that's really unfortunate is if if all that happens is let's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now which\nIs you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly you lose it let's say by eight or ten or seats you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and that's the thing they're going to be almost nothing they can get through\nAlmost nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which they'll find ways to get those ... I'm sure of it but other than that you're going to get any real advances are not getting any tax stuff you're you're going to have tough times with any regulation you're going to get ... you know none of this stuff is going to be easy\nAs long as you keep renting a massive deficit you'll get all those bills through yeah just just keep spending money and they'll vote for it yeah\nYeah it's not a problem to show you the house and how dramatic it is at least by the polls look and I know you're gonna say well the polls got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right\nA and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national bulls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know whether this whole we're not sure but right now the models are showing 'em there is a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats can pick up eighty three seats\nNow to point one percent chance really unlikely like you say that that an absolute no it's not going to get to eighty three right ... ... the models are also showing there's a point one chance for Republicans to hold the same amount of seats they have now\nAnd if you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you can consider cardio among the NBA cleared personal EKG device for just Ninety nine dollars cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone\nAnd it fits in your pocket so you can take any ... any time anywhere to order ... cardio dot com and then you pay a R.

stay and so Humanae\nHas actually partnered up with ... which is guaranteed trust is a great company it's been around for over eight years and we are offering this new short term home healthcare insurance to cover you while you're at home to cover\nA home health care home health care aide even with benefits for prescription costs as well as hospitals stay um coverage\nSo ... so it's so it's a wide wide berth civil a lot of items that are put into a policy like this I'm as probably ... is this something new or that that you're that you're offering has this been out there for a long time\nNo this is actually new within the last couple of months that's new to new within our portfolio I guess you want to say\nAh there's probably a few other companies out there but knew the Humanae we've been doing this for a month you know after training and going over it but over a month and people are actually liking that\nYou know hey I get paid back for prescriptions that I'm taking\nA which most of us take at least one or so and then it's also going to cover it depends on what you look at and how much you want and you kind of can build your own kind of like a ... you know happy Miller I'm sure my way to do this or that\nSo you can put in the hospital stay it comes with the basic short term healthcare you can add pieces to it to help cover your gaps in your insurance coverage\nOkay good so it's very customized bullet cells like and that's kind of what is that where a lot of products are going in the future to to give people better choices and and there seem it seems to be complicated so this kind of fills those holes right\nRight it does it does cover those gaps in care\nBut it also like Shawn said a lot of us are taking medications this policy is actually for anyone forty years old and older not just the sixty five Medicare people so I this this covers some co pays for you and and a lot of us that take medication every day we're all paying a co pay almost every month\nIn the big picture um or the changes from Obamacare a ... there's a lot of high level stuff\nOut there and maybe we don't even want to go down that road because I I think none of us really know and maybe you don't either all where this is all going and so you know a lot of times you're just trying to to to to provide products that really meet the needs of the of the clients white here in southern Colorado\nThat that that need so yeah we'll avoid that subject but I think you know where where it's all going I'm sure you we all scratch our heads and and maybe you know he met is no different you try to\nTo continue on this track 'em in the time that we have I Do want to talk about some of the supplements and Medicare and I must admit I'm One of those that I don't know a lot about it\nBut the the Medicare ... supplements I think are valuable ... can you wonder if you explain that to where we position is in our families and our futures [laughter]\nSo that's where we as agents branding I go in and we make sure so the first thing is what you know like I said before what keeps you up at night while I'm worried about hospitals I'm worried about these so we'll do that needs analysis so supplemental are what they are\nYour Medicare is going to pay first or even your individual and then you're supplemental insurance is going to come in and pay what's leftover or depend on the plan what small co pays you may have or out of pocket you may have\nUm [noise] you'd does range from there's got from a through and\nSo those are quite a few out there that you can kind of look at it and very they're very him priced too so\nYou may be paying your Medicare premium plus you have to pay that supplemental premium and that's where a lot of families may not be able to afford that bigger premium\nSo then at that point that's where we go okay well let's look at this other option which may be Medicare Advantage and I think brandy can cover Medicare Advantage is a little bit more on that side\nYeah and with with the supplements to you also have to have a prescription drug plan a lot of people that we run into they were like why do we even I don't take medication I don't want him a prescription drug plan\nA lot of people don't realize that Medicare penalize if you if you did not get a prescription drug plan when your Medicare start and that penalty goes for life so it's kind of scary to think about but that's where the Medicare Advantage comes in and we kind of put everything altogether\nA way kind of think about it as a Sean does it really well it's a combination played at the Mexican restaurant where we we put it all together we put your medical your prescription and everything else all in one plan and it really covers everything or under one umbrella\nSo when the chips are down we need to solve so we need to we need to solve you know and this is I think this discussion is really good because I Know so little about it and I've said so many times this is a team sport\nYou know this aging thing is a team sport there's so many things that we don't know the island theory is the more you think you know the more you find out you don't know so you really need a a team of professionals around you\nUm we're talking with you man of brandy Johnson and Sean modest and uh and what I'd like to do is just quickly just cover if you if they've got questions on this subject and they would like to\nDo to have some more information is there an office number that they can call you at [noise] I'm\nActually on our office as we stayed at the beginning of the show is in Colorado Springs the best way to get a hold of Sean and I are on our cell phone okay and my cell phone number seven one nine to three eight six three five five and Sean's is seven one nine\nTo three seven four or five one night\nOkay and and we're going to do that again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it\nOr will be able to to give you more this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that face with families you know you're walking into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming next I mean we we don't know what's gonna happen\nAll insurance is or what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect you and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nThe defense team yeah yeah and just because you're gonna see things coming that we don't see how that are still sort of amazed at how complex\nThis whole this whole system is Shaun how 'bout you what what are some of the challenges similar or do you if you walk in and you've dealt with families I'm getting there do you think getting their affairs in order maybe one of the big things people need to think about\nI think affairs in order huge because we'll all my kids can just throw me outside or my kids can pay for things and you're going\nNo ... I bet you if we made a phone call they'd probably say how much is it what do we need to do so um but yeah I I Would say truthfully we're all used to a corporate world where we have an HR person that says here you need this take this\nWhere we all retired and all of a sudden we're going what do I do where do I go that's where I ... you could say brandy and I are your age are person 'cause we can help direct\nEven I I'm a big believer even if he didn't pick him in at least we helped you make a good choice in what you're going to do next right or where to plant and what to do\nYou need a strategy team to guide you so I think this is a great discussion and they were going to ... uh come back and just a few moments and it's kind of close out the show and we'll give you the overview to Humanae oh you're listening to the senior living today show we'll be right back after these a brief messages so don't go away\nSometimes in our lives we need a little help whether it's you or a loved

story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just do a stab Bush a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second

pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation we get from ball the Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name swept

conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across ... years ago and maybe even you said it\nUh but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society and it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism\nOff the clocks and the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order a restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you know there was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all good and fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was a before the

I mean 'cause I saw lots of tea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the ... plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the laws the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're supposed we're supposed to be in a civil society\nRight now my several of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their\nChildren you know and the homemade signs\nHow many people they chased down and rest one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care she and a was a John Lewis marched out in to the crowded\nCrowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't do you remember where\nThey tried to get them to be very crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become of violent mob they didn't would have happened if Donald Trump\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd\nIn Washington D. C. would not have been pretty it would not have been\nPretty by the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob there like ... ... and they're taking over that's ... that's a riot\nThat is why it by a mob you know if you do just from the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people and intent on causing trouble or violence okay and and the quote is\nA mob of protesters not to a disorderly crowd of people\nThat are trying to what it was a ... chance on causing trouble I mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh's a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's the end but that doesn't does it say there unless you're right\nIt just says intent on causing trouble it right you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though is that the media\nDoes not see harassing it's causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a correctly that says like the you know there it's basically a you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr the [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean but at\nNight I said I knew the Irish guy who\nIs the white people if they do is the white people do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter]\nThings first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob me yes I'm going to call it a mob a now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here to\nProtest is guaranteed to a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to protest and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy\nFor what a mob a protest that looks like he is a matter of fact\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech he's the one I only around things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his rallies he said knock the crap out of them are what'd you and seriously okay that's all right okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here is what she's saying to the law makers and leftist continue to push\nProtesters guarantee to sorry sorry [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nHere's here's the problem let's wretched things down just a bit and listen to somebody\n... I think there's a real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker he he might think that that's okay but what is it realizes that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nWhat I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which basically was nearly killed the guy shooting a football field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot [noise] usually has almost go he was showing this is for healthcare hit a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and had a my ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion that these are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratcheted purging that volunteer ever OK ever reason for or a means we're trying to think\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation those who are actually getting licensed they bear some responsibility of this extra power\n[noise] so do you remember the time when people like Rick Baldwin in ... is that you couldn't say you're going to target a district\nBecause that of course led to violence or get to the district remember the lectures of your words have power because you don't know who's listening to them and we said unless you're unless you're endorsing this we are calling for peaceful rallies\nAnd they were and they were\nThese are not peaceful how many people were arrested from the Tea Party\nRiots mobs\nHow many I don't remember any\nThere's four hundred just last weekend on the left four hundred that's not a peaceful protest your words do have power because you'd do mean via now how can Glenn Beck even say that\nI'll back it up when we come back\nPlan that\nYou know that the police watch on demand\nPassively dot com slash TV you can watch every episode uh for the record and watching documentaries one of those buildings house for terrorists to actually back she was competition is a wonderful woman to serve a perceived to learn what they're talking about\nFamily friendly shows like Lindsey tree that opposition the birthplace of America and brush up all your survival skills by watching independence usa and everyone else is out there running around five\nWere going to be ready for being watched Glenn how America and welcome to the program you can on demand at the least outcome bless the blaze TV today\nThat would be the last ... others target non white immigrant workers\nWho's doing that\nI mean I guess they would claim that like border enforcement right like ... ... ... yeah that's the law\nThey're claiming we do not know who's in our country and we're also worried about terrorism I'm a ... with a populist message attacks religious minorities well who could that be [laughter] 'cause I I Know I Know I went to stand with Israel if anybody's attacking religious minorities hell with that\nReligious majorities it's the left conservatives denounces the president and his allies for flouting the Constitution's during the I'd said stored socialism yep did that one because that's what's happening\nACA Alexandria Ocasio Cortez yeah that's a it's a crazy accusations rice point\nMany on the left warn that fashion is no socialism is taking root in America socialism\nYeah I mean people in the less they fascist every time they don't like might as well no no no I ... fascism ... that is it socialism that is sweeping than they were all socialist now\nThat's what's sleeping is sweeping the nation are parallels between the two areas aren't perfect but ...\nIs an understatement of the year can you say that a lot about the parallels between the two areas aren't perfect they're not perfect but I did one way to describe a three quarters of them are completely inaccurate\nBut as an aide to a night late Nineteen thirties as today political rank or social division alien ideologies sparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology\nOf today yeah of then I mean the fact that one of the two major party has embraced democratic socialism is already alien to me yes\nThe the the fear back in uh the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nWell okay um\nI guess I mean her and Mussolini that said that ah FDR is one of us he is a fascist so maybe it was a hang on\nCheckout blends blog at five Ninety case yes J. dot com and keyboard going back [noise]\nAnd probably you know if you look at the the civil unrest in America and you really look at the history you will find that it is\nAlmost always the left and the communist or Marxist left\nThat is behind the civil unrest if you look at a you know here's Seventeen eighty three to Seventeen Ninety nine and you know Eighteen twenty nine to Eighteen fifty the riots and ensue gets that paragraph each\nBut after the communist manifesto\nWell then you start to get some interesting\nUsually called strikes now some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race\nBut a lot of these come from a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the Klan\nHe shows the first ... a movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the Klan\n... really involved in any way to the military and all sorts of things so you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots in the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen on word well that's because of re segregation and all of the things that a progressive\nAlright but let me just go through and see if you couldn't find any\nPatterns here the Patterson silk strike the ... the Indianapolis streetcar strike a the Seattle general strike mayday riots read this summer the Boston police strike the steel strike\nAny of those seems a labor related labor related does I'm Sorry\nIf you look these up almost every time you will find the international workers' of the world\nWho are the international workers' of the world\nThat is of course a base than communist and is it is the communist\nIrma here in America because of the world unite rise up against your oppressors you also had in Nineteen sixty and the preparedness day bombing in ...\nAh you had a um [noise] ah you had read\nSummer which was about twenty eight day riots\nYou had the scent trail you a massacre was what's interesting is the preparedness day bombing\nThat was saying you you can't get involved in the war because it's so unethical and we're going to bomb you until you stop the best way to say that we're a bright ... trillion massacre if I'm not mistaken was again the leftists the ... I Can't remember which one it was ... station that was against\nA all of the um all of the American legion Z\nAnd they were coming up so their test I think it was a parade and they actually end up\nRioting and killing people okay good then you look ... Ortiz\nIt's a ... century earlier was a an industrial workers of the world and say\nThank you okay Minneapolis or many thirty for the auto light strike the west coast long shores strike do even know what that one was that when that happened that may ninth through October twelfth\nThat one's shut down San Francisco bay a the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike the battle over the overpass the republic steel strike almost all of these and including many of the rich\nHave communist and Marxist fingerprints on them\nI said it's is fundamental to the ideology right revolution is funded is there is not surprising that this was happening again ... I just I'm I'm really\nTired of of sharing a shouldn't say it this way I'm really tired of the media and there lies Under Cover up for his proof\nYou know Donald Trump says that you and media are the enemy of the American people\nWell if you are knowingly lying\nYou are\nAnd I'm I'm Sorry but I'm I'm trying to get my arms a group of intelligent people that cannot see that what they said about the Tea Party happened\nIs now what they were excusing from the left and we already have attempted assassination somebody who tried to assassinate\nCongress the Republican congressmen yeah almost triggers shooting at all of them he was shouting this is for health care\nHe thinks there might be an assassination I don't know he was standing on a freaking baseball field being shot at and then got attacked it as well yeah I can I can believe he thinks that might happen I Belong to a gym a couple of times\nI have worn that is the only thing that hasn't happened if you were looking in the Nineteen thirties the teams the sixties and now today the only thing has been repeated itself almost exactly assassinations\nBecause the press deal out of it because they wanted to bury it because it was a Bernie\nSanders volunteer people don't realize you had someone tried to kill\nA third of the congressman a third\nRight now I think it was I Want to say it was because there was [noise] but I think it was like one tenth of the elected Republicans okay um so yeah you know they'll say\nOh I Am about ten ... he tried to kill the\nMass of Republicans amazing it is incredible not by the way not in Nineteen\nEighteen but this is just what it does is she doesn't Seventeen\nRight I mean this is not a long time ago was that was sixteen or Seventeen it was seven seven ten minutes isn't it ... the fact that we just had the one year anniversary of the game that was a month or two ago\nUh I you know it's incredible that that event at the like how on\nEarth can you be encouraging your crazy side\nWhen you're Maxine Waters or your you know ah someone on the left encouraging them to go out and get in the face of Republican congressman when they've already tried this one at the base we've seen the results of encouraging people to get in the face of Republican congressmen we never said\nAnything like that we talked about ideas you talked about gathering right gathering together or you saw the the actual\nGatherings we saw the one in Washington DC you got five hundred thousand people there's apparently a piece of trash left after we walked out of that place let me go to Dan in Georgia hello Dan you're on the Glenn Beck ...\nOne side in the image of Donald Trump\nOther side lists all his major achievements\nThe commemorative one ounce coin is the only presidential Trump coin made Ninety nine point nine percent silver not silver plated and its IRA approve\nThis the price of silver rises so will the value of these points go to the Trump coined twenty twenty dot com use the code history to save five dollars per call or text history to five eleven five level so the Trump coined twenty twenty dot com [noise] the silver twenty twenty President Trump [laughter]\nSaturday October third game what's new today on the free our radio a radio\nA perfect for decorating the house or just studying the scary mood our pumpkins by the ... with labor and why why we've got\nEveryone's talking about like the famous people voters fog Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\nBy\nRadio prescription painkillers are not only option for treating pain especially after surgery to learn more visit planned against ... dot com\n[noise] one of the best kept secrets in Oklahoma is the national wrestling hall of fame in Stillwater this institution preserves the history of the world's oldest sports as well as honoring the best amateur wrestlers ever\nThe museum offers the heritage and the history of wrestling as well as featuring memorabilia including Olympic gold medals come visit the national wrestling homeless fame and museum in Stillwater, Oklahoma and visit them online and W.

to one another but we\nWere not at a place where I think you grab a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads that surge just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage kind of a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen that before in my lifetime you know rage an outrageous in headlines of articles all the time\nBut it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case talking about Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do in Iraq I think\nYou know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged his response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean they just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel like I Know you are there's a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country ... from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here to Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage or and when sometimes we're the we're the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your\nComments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today\nBut but but again I I the Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture the whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about bond offer\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious um but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry\nThey were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture and our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that we live in two in every generation of space there challenges but this is our moment and in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways\nA that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated a outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our\nCable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around the Samaritan woman at the well\nAnd I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYou fight but you fight or a you know for example a ... war at a people and\nReach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage well\nHere's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know ah trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the gold those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot\nAnd Christians in the age of outrageous is to is to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and an income for what it's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just strategic lean you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus ...\nWe take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling who are we modeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type back in just a second [noise]\nClans that\nTake bakers quarterback stresses statues

do if they did get jobs and decide to live here what kind of what kind of philosophies are they bringing with them\nAll the media doesn't care about any of that and you know the Democrats don't care about any of that of course not hear about because they ... they just want them here as voters\nAlready they're setting out to all these registration forms in Texas the Democrats are in Texas set out but voter registration forms to illegals all over the state inviting them they've already filled out the the US citizenship box Bush yet they check the S.\nAnd sent this out to non residents all over

which is Houston Dallas County which is Dallas those are blue areas and it's a massive turnout massive turnout uh if the the red parts of the state don't actually turned out\nThis state could be in big trouble because it is a massive\nTurnout is there any thought or with the caravan of just learning from our friends to the south and what we do is we just let people come in and we just kinda guide them until they get all the way to Canada and they're walking north they'd never that necessarily they're stopping here\nA candidate beautiful this kind of your time of year we didn't kind of it's kind of walk on the side of the streets and just kind of having them\nAnd we would if is there was going to Canada and they were protesting\nCanada I think there'll be a lot of people have said just don't cause any trial just let them go to Canada I'm sure a lot of people in Mexico are saying that just right just what was not our problem they just want to go to America just not our problem well it is your problem and if\nMexico Canada would say to us you stop this or we're not going to trade with you we zero eight though like they give us any aid zero zero cheese whatever it is\nStephen

remember they were shooting the fact I have video of it today they're doing it again they're not shooting from behind so you don't see the crowd\nAnd Obama is out and he's in you know these these rooms that are like four hundred people maybe ... maybe tops two thousand\nAnd they're shooting it so it looks like a big crowd but it's not they did that in the midterms 'cause he's crowds went away here we are at the midterms\nAnd Donald Trump still has these gigantic crowds and and listen\nTo what can we played Sarah the audio that was played on the loudspeakers outside of the rally last night

to have those announcements\nAre but we we did um and the crowd was more than ... if I was a\nRobert Francis a O'Brian or what's his name or ... or running against Ted Cruz I Would be a little concerned um because it was an overwhelming response from Texas where Texans\nI thought were a little um [noise] I don't know calm about\nThis election and it didn't really realize how much money Soros and others have poured in to make this a blue wave here in Texas more than any other Senate candidate or for any quarter and history thirty eight million dollars for Beto just for him that's not all that and\nThat's not including the ... money that is going into this date me outside a pack of money and tons of that um so uh we're going to talk to the uh Governor Greg Abbott we're going to talk to them a little bit about the caravan and also about what's happening\nUh here in our state he's also running for reelection but his he's so far ahead of any contender he is really the greatest\nGovernor I have ever\nI've ever lived under I mean I've never had a governor of a state that I've been more proud of\nA than a Greg Abbott um and\nObviously a lot of Texans feel the same way because it's a I mean it's a run away campaign for him\nBut the state of the state and the election when we come back then Governor Greg Abbott and arguing\nWeb ... news talk take us on the go way

everyone seems to be giving around town with ... major issues as of right now\nNinety KCBS Jay [noise]\nClaimed that come and we're thrilled to have a the a great governor from the great state of Texas Governor Greg Abbott on with us now hello governor how are you sir\nReally and I am doing terrific how's it going\nGood it's always good to talk to you I'm a I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWhere this may be frustrating because the true answer is but it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a broad running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're sitting with regard to the turnout is a massive records are not just for mid term elections which is what this is a but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nOr the amount of those that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is is is that is a massive number of people are turning out to vote with another with court but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure we're supposed to be critical\nSomething to stop it uh but here's all I can tell your audience and that is\nIf you care about the future of Texas if you care about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines this election we're because there are other people out there who are casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this\nNeed to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said yeah that's the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I I've always hated that phrase but in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say\nYou know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing I'm a election is it not\nWell he captured the as soon as very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either rent under do label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and didn't they were a progressive\nAnd now they're openly or lifting themselves as socialist and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor\nIn Florida a isn't out and now he says he is a socialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the lab and the same thing is happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open border policies that is socialism a with a look at the uh wealth distribution policies that is socialism and these people don't realize and that is\nSocialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate in Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and ah the you know unbeknownst to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing in so many of your listeners need to understand is that as a George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a half a million dollars not directly to a candidate\nIn Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that you as bonded these ground games to get out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions\nAnd listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really blew cities and counties you have a Dallas year after that and you have San Antonio you have all that and you have El Paso\nAnd so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people are who are Republican to be able to\nCobble together the boats that are needed to make sure that we keep Texas that the passion of freedom that back to the liberty or in the past year the conservatism and so uh every vote counts and we really need to get people excited enthusiastic about this the same way they were\nThey may have had their act their files access to Google says no evidence any data has been

I guess dot com slash radio\nThe Glenn Beck blog has pretty ... why\nAny radio I'm only ... president trying to think what he calls tremendous spirit to make Republicans winners in the mid term elections two weeks from today the president saying yesterday\nI think the Republicans are going to do very nicely with what very well with the Senate\nTrump said Republicans can check out the tax cuts security add a strong libertarian they're calling and former President Obama was rattling voters in Nevada yesterday and laughing at traffic ministry saying now we've got a chance to restore some sanity to our politics\nAnd if not a democratic or a Republican idea that we\nNot both pressured the attorney general or the FBI they use the criminal justice system to try to punish political opponents that's not how America work that's awesome\nDidn't buy dictatorship we're not supposed to\nHe said that's kind of politics as a conservative it's radical Turkey's president says Saudi Arabia planned that murder ... days before the opposition journalist was killed\n\nBody than a Fox News parts democracy or given found sky news reports in east in all Turkey's president calls it a Savage murder at the council it to the Saudi conflict premeditated\nI don't know I mean I think you know I I feel like a conservatives and Republicans get teased by Minnesota a lot and you think oh well maybe this time is going to be the time and a lot of times that never has a\nBut we saw that in the presidential election too I mean we how many times did Pennsylvania seem like it was ... to me that's going to happen and they never did until this last election where did turn over a I think the more interesting race those the ones for attorney general\nIn Minnesota we know this one because Keith Ellison is running and normally I don't think we talk about a specific attorney general race it's not necessarily national interest is one with Keith Ellison I think is Alison was up by five points in the last full however that Paul happened right before\nAll these sort of accusation started flowing against peace that will not true though is it him in the bathroom with the guy is that true [laughter]\nI don't know what allegations that is I don't there was a new allegations on a repeated I Believe you're thinking of Cory Booker there was that oh you live in our area that yes yes yeah a little bit for it I Want to not true is it I mean I don't but as I think you should all these things do you are innocent until proven yet either Simon charges against Cory Booker right one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every month up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man and editors but we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know\nThat's the way I think you're supposed to hey let's why innocent until proven guilty is a thing\nA and I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism about some of these relationships break up and there's\nThings that and who knows there's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what would they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believed\nCabin or should be you know I don't know put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with a they don't care about it he thousand can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations ... it was fascinating at the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happen latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda\nWow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the time and he's she's credible\nShe's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy dated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses there's Dr reports\nAt the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't have to win this crazy yeah it's\nAn amazing mind so that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they felt they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead it's forty three thirty six so right now do we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go ah there's a if you're looking at\nRight now a forty a four feet are that are\nSafe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have a seat it's forty six excuse me forty effect if you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes a Tennessee which is\nStill very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head they're a vibrant and then in Texas bill leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer than he did a few or a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're going to be fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can pull\nOff six of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things past ah so you know at that level of whether it's a I mean they could lose it to that could easily diluted impossible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six this is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a big difference uh still could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nThe election by numbers\nOn the ... over twenty third this is the Glenn Beck program\nAll right when I take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and then we come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even\nConsidered it to really know well you know that which is er out but he ... saw Donald Trump\nYou know and which is er\nI I did not know that you haven't been keeping track of all the ... the the which is that are putting X's on Donald Trump and\nAnd Ted Cruz and others and what are they what are the ... one of the ... actually intended to accomplish destroy them to destroy them yeah I have not seen this no oh okay well I've I've kinda brushed off myself I'm In I'm up on it but I kind of brushed it off I like I which is\nNo there is something else that we now have from a credible source that I think every American especially women need to be aware of what's coming up and just saying\nYou happen to see [noise]\nStories [noise]\n\nIMF financial warnings and the escalation in the central bank gold buying in Hungary\nIs making the news ...\nHungary has increased its gold reserves by one thousand percent in a due to increasing quote safety concerns\nIs the first time since Nineteen eighty six that\nHungary's central bank is buying gold bullion and it's a lot of it up thirty one point five tons\nOf gold ah they also have repatriated their gold from the bank of England to Budapest central banks in Europe are diversifying are moving in and repatriating to take possession of the gold in their own country\n... maybe talking about that for a while really ... who knows that\nAre hungry in Poland or the most recent central banks to do this but Austria the Netherlands and the Germans\nWere the first to do it uh they have been repatriating their gold from the bank of England and the Federal Reserve in recent months and years she's bought it from Goldman were that a lot easier right why us for back one of those early [noise]\nThe reason why repatriation of gold is dangerous is because of a word and write this down on\nNo matter who do the very high path occasion thing again or you just saying they're ready to have\nWhen you hear it your blood will run cold when you hear\nPeople actually talking about well the problem is re high publication that's when you had to the mountains [laughter] that's when you know so that's the only reason why I bring this word up when you read about it in a serious way that they are now starting to discuss ... that's when you run for the hills okay\nRight now we're at the beginning of that possible wonderful thing by um you know everybody claiming their gold and who's gold really is it all\nAnd all of the central banks

political Marxist activist marching with the Honduran flag\nIn protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them as they're marching towards our border they're not refugees\nThey chose to leave their country they're finding their country\nThey were trying to get a do a political stunt so what what are these people where did they get the money who's doing the

okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen\nWhat who's providing medical aid who's providing the water\n\nWho's providing the trucks that so far we haven't seen anywhere else we aired them yesterday on the news and why it matters in fact there I don't know if we have this video\nBut if we could play this a video or if you have it the the video of a these migrants being loaded up in a giant semi trucks they're being trucked from place to place from photo opportunity to photo opportunity\nYou pointed this out there that I I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers\nAnd it's like well a stroller is not designed for a thousand mile walk down right like that's not how that happened then now they're getting out there grouping up there for a couple of miles the cameras get them then they get back in trucks and ... and they ... they drive\nLook at the ... video enroll that video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into

do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you put military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation and then how does it play\nHow was that good for anybody if cars you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that sent who wins and and I don't think they're going to wind up in the country or reckon can I don't think that it has to happen that way but\nI'll tell you what if you have if you would have a must happen what do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around a process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in wars for America can\nYes ... year you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treat it as an invasion turn way\nYou see there's an invading force these people they're not legally [noise]\nNow the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor\nPeople away and I want you to listen\nTo all of the people on television that are

it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat ... so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said oh it's you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media saying\nIt's always about local that as a as the Kavanaugh facing coupled with Cortez coming out and saying you know capitalism is not going to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think the Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bed\nI was telling somebody earlier this week the orange he just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door of the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted Democrat I can you know continue to vote Democrat\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was then rod ... district and these are we went to a machine shop\nAnd these are life long you know Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump but I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter so I just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nThat I had to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away how\nDo how do you think the president and ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up\nStop it I mean I think the\nPresident's made it clear where there are a country of laws or not and it it you know the the roost that they're using that this is\nUh it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people did their side\nBecause now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers or their asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrived to which would be

that are upset at the\nThe the the\nPoliticians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba they've been trying to do all kinds of ... in in Honduras\nThere 'cause they're carrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership is\nI think that I mean it's amazing to me that no one has said that that

profound\nI got something last night have you seen the copy by the way hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser a Christina Ford\nShe was the she was the woman that was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by ... head of homeland security as the\nA sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again the woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not\nDr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year so she's not a democratic hack\nAnd also\nNot a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in ... her expertise is\nOn old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any of CNN not going to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should be the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats left wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them\nShe then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court not for profit institution but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and\nQuote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and again\nLike she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah Iraq Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility in with the left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's\nWon't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee vis explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this knew exactly\nWhat it was now she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute\nIt may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\n\nIf you are looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this this this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session lift the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attack changed to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well\nIf you say you're in your late\nTeens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen\nIn high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been\nIn the mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years it gets\nBetter this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged tack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the early Nineteen\nEighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nJoined in return every Saturday and eight thirty for the senior living today show the show about seniors

not about Ford\nAnd this is not about making sure that these charges stick its why as soon as this happened\nAs soon as Jeff Flake said no no wait a minute hang on we want an FBI or investigation as soon as that happened the narrative changed now they're going after him saying he lied about drinking beer\n[laughter] okay he was for the love of Pete people so this is how do you\nLook at how the accusations that he wasn't by a drunk but how would you confirmed me while I Know I Know it's ridiculous\nI Know so uh we get into that later because I as an alcoholic I got a lot to say on that one [laughter] um but ah\nThey've changed the narrative and they are playing the American people and here's an here's how it's working\nWhat they've done is they've turn this into something that is more than Kavanaugh look if Kavanaugh is a guy who did this I don't want him on the Supreme Court none of us do nobody does that's a bad thing\nBut you can't just smear somebody you have to have some evidence so because of the lack of evidence what they've done is they've not made this about Kavanaugh they've instead made this about victims\nEvidence play the elevator encounter with Jeff Flake\nI I'm Sorry on my bachelor and all that you're going to be here and now that you might you know someone\nWho they don't want my heart is not alone\nIn your carry on\nThis woman has obviously a horrible

was let go but didn't understand it I I Know what is happening how can the African American community be cheering this guy well\nIt's very easy once you're away from it emotionally and you actually look into it it's easy\nWhat was happening was African Americans were feeling that there was no justice in America it's always the black guy that gets blamed and then he goes to court and the white system puts them behind bars and so they weren't rooting for him\nThey wanted anyone to beat the system they wanted anyone to prove that a black guy could we could go to court and not be guilty that's what they wanted they wanted a victory against the system\nTotally understandable\nUs the African American community now same people did O.

cases the new term that starts this hour as the FBI\nYeah I mean I have remained the same I haven't changed actually take these these political quizzes every now and then and my ideology has stayed the same what was happening though is that the the party itself has gone absolutely and fame ah this is not this is not what I signed up for\nRight um I've been watching you on Twitter and you've been um\nYou want to the only Democrats that have come out and said this is nuts gimme gimme are viewing the lay of the land from a democratic point of view from your point of view\nSure I think it's perfectly legitimate to oppose Brett Kavanaugh's nomination on the basis of differences and judicial philosophy a you know if you believe certain things that he doesn't align with those beliefs let's find that's what the Democratic process as for\n'em now that being said you you leave it at that rate you don't go ahead and try to chop off someone's head\nAnd promote these outrageous accusations against them specifically the the one by this this woman Julie sweat Nick who just don't even ask the snow is I mean we're there they are so absurd I I actually attended an all boys Catholic school too so I could kind of speak to the culture and how\nHow those communities operate I mean the thought that a group of Fifteen year olds would be running a gang rape cartel all throughout high school and nobody would know anything about it\nUp until now is just it's ludicrous and then that eight and a goal this woman must have been like Twenty years old at the time that this happened the cheapest frequenting parties with high school ...\nYears [laughter] I Know I Know is high school sophomore myself oh man all me and my buddies\nWe were the college chicks were all over [laughter] you know women women usually look for a young man you know especially those in high school that never happens that never happens\nEspecially Brett Kavanaugh who let's be clear the guy sounds like he was a complete torque when he was ... when he was in high school this is somebody who kept ... you can see on his calendar he literally has notes of what his parents would ground him\nI mean this guy was a complete door in high school and he's like the kind of guy who if he comes home with your daughter or your sister you'd say she really did well first off this is great I'm really happy\nSo the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel in the suburbs of Maryland is just asinine on his face but you're saying is that we have entered I think that we've abandoned a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right where we just believe things based on a matter of faith\nBased on historical pattern of injustices and notions and that's what's happening here late but they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things or because you know women have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism and there it's still exists therefore he's guilty right\nIt's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse\nThis is like reliving the O. J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but\nHe put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago\nThat the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black men for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent\nMore than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community and they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nThey all know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and let me tell you I think uh [noise]\nDr Ford who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt her testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nA just a ... it's a series of inconsistencies\nThat would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications ah in political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized or to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucified someone with zero evidence and then what you're doing now is that\nThey're moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about ah well you know he must have drank while he was in\nIn college or whatever who cares\nBut it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like pleading Adam St Lawrence those goalpost seemed kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo John Carlin we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat\nOr who uh has not lost his footing ah with with reason um\nSo the address people address people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes then there's also a a a chance at USCB Cooper right there you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a case it based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOther people that are justice qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system short of murder\nSo the question now is the economist is right and there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is exculpatory right the if the guy's calendar clear is that right\nIt's testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to\nCast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely fine that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nThe way there's is into court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you were asked to write this would not need any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of when this happens four times so I think people need to cash this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is play\nYou buy associate right mark judge I I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of the country has never met met right so we're just going up here see right now\nAnd based on his own memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had a serious drinking issues it's not Brett ... we're we're not nominating mark judge of the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut well we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud\nRight we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them politically or ideologically that insane that's what they do in in in ... public spending third world countries that's not where we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second generally do you have to um I actually have to run to the meeting about okay All right well run too I mean we'll talk we'll talk some other time but thank you so much [noise]\nI really want to I really want to

News President Trump tweeted out about the agreement with Canada worked out just before midnight joining Mexico and it's just about to talk about it at the White House ceremony commerce secretary Wilbur Ross says\nHow in the world can that be run by one city it's impossible I Want to allow county is to be counties and regions to be regions and people to be people and it's totally fine the issue becomes why do I want to enforce my will upon you I Want you to be as conservative or liberal as you want to be\nPeople tease me and say Larry you're from queens how do you know you know what's right for upstate\nI don't that's the point and guess what you don't know what's right for me in Queens either were even\nHow do I let you be you you let me me me and we can all be free to gather\nWhat a ton of work it has word\nThat's our original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York where do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote 'cause it's a five way race in New York state and we are a plurality state not a majority says we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen at present but if it's in the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be forward when this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nTo does not just a Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is is that the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even come in second would shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it would make better Democrats and Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrats they don't have to worry about small business\nDon't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties is supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that were the libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened in civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government\nNow they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] man will be a massive a massive culture shock within within the uh the state and within the nation\nBut something else I don't have a career to protect\nI don't have people to pay back I don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus on several things one a complete re board of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government\nI next that the credit culture of transparency because a problem with the government is now is they're enforcing the kings well so they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and\nI don't want the government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nYou've read the constitution or what does that I don't know I Know\nI Know it's I'm not sure it's an old during the day to document\nTheir ego yes anyway I think we sort of the way while ago\nBut yes that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met or individual businesses that individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs\nGrowth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value to each community we don't do that well in New York said it all we have things called regional economic economic development of corporations\nWhich Albany which is a capital gains decides where the money is spent\nAnd opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county\nHow buttons that the county's can start to budget to zero so they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concept one instead\nOf me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and through lowering spending\nHere's one idea that those both of those we have a bridges right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that bridges named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights of the bridge we retain the asset I got no business gotten that giving my ass it up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all\nThese companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year on marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that's using the weekends I got a bridge you can name and\nThat bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area and hundreds of thousands of cars pass it every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nOn a law that taxes hang on just looking at Texas New York populist the taxes you should listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but here's the best part now we have them do maintenance again we own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is just to repair it right\nThey begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now in New York state collapse we don't have enough money\nThese guys do will have to have safe or bridges less money and guess what we can start with holes in New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars you know\nI don't know if you're a truck driver I don't think a truck driver you pay by the axle\nYou're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge less money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea and there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so where you are you ... it's amazing to me how we are running\nHeadlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have and embrace democratic socialism yes\nBut we won't embrace this very American idea how do you how do you get the common sense Democrat and Republican who has been raised in New York so their mentality is me this one cell in Texas\nHow do you get them in New York to see guys this this that it's already seller\nBefore the Republicans and they all kept given up I mean they don't show up or the Democrats I think I'm afraid so let's just vote Democrat the reality is again Seventy percent New Yorkers don't vote those who do vote vote because of fear we can't have fear but the reason why people vote it's simply the wrong answer\nMan but I Would say that in reality I'm trying to change just to make it so that people stop voting for the last of two evils and instead vote for someone\nAnd it is working I Am actually using if you notice I'm using non traditional media traditionally it does not want to cover me and polls don't wanna deal with me but not the media is working and I'm getting out there and people are seeing me they're responding to me and this is what's working the way to make this happen is through non traditional media and believe it or not\nPeople are getting it they actually like it I hear all the time people say Larry honor to be with you\nYou're saying but you actually answer questions you actually have a plan and\nThey love it and that's what I say it look my plan may be faulty maybe they will we can't leave all the bridges maybe we can't raise fifty billion maybe only rate thirty billion\nThat when you do okay tell me what that ... ... and let me ask you can I hold you over for one more break yes\nOkay a oldie over and and tell me how we fix education and higher education it's out of control its its post modernist it's indoctrinate ing and it's in leaving our children to debt when we\nCome back to Larry sharp I have to tell you if I was living in New York [noise] and I was a Republican I Can't I cannot imagine a reason\nWhy I Would not vote for him to the gym or the ... the Democrat is
